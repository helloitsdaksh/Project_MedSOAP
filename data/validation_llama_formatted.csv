"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello! I see that you were referred to our hospital for a lung adenocarcinoma measuring 28 mm in your right upper lobe. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: We have planned a UVATS procedure to resect the tumor. Are you familiar with this procedure? Patient: Not really, can you explain it to me? Doctor: Of course. During the procedure, you will be placed in the left lateral decubitus position under general anesthesia. We will then make a 4-cm skin incision for the main port in the sixth intercostal space at the anterior axillary line. Patient: Okay, I see. Doctor: A wound retractor will be used to allow the insertion of a flexible thoracoscope, endoscopic autosuturing device, and vessel-sealing device via the main port incision. This will also allow us to extract the specimen after the operation. Patient: Hmm, I understand. Doctor: During the operation, we found an incomplete interlobar fissure between the upper and middle lobe, as well as abnormal lobulation of the upper lobe. Therefore, we carried out a modified marionette technique. Patient: What does that involve? Doctor: First, an Internal organ retractor was inserted into the thoracic cavity using a clip applier. This allowed the retractor to grasp the targeted lung parenchyma properly. Patient: Okay. Doctor: Second, we prepared two sets of looped 1-0 nylon-threaded 18-gauge injection needles. These needles were optimally pierced through the thoracic wall separately. Patient: And then what happened? Doctor: Finally, both ends of the 1-0 nylon thread attached to the Internal organ retractor were pulled out through the looped nylon. This allowed us to perform the procedure more effectively. Patient: I see. So, what are the follow-up requirements for this procedure? Doctor: You will need regular check-ups and monitoring to ensure that the tumor has been completely removed and that there are no complications. We will provide you with more information regarding your follow-up appointments. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate the explanation. Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. We're here to help. Patient: I think I understand everything now. Thanks again. Doctor: No problem, take care, and we'll see you at your follow-up appointment. [/INST] S: The patient confirmed a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe, measuring 28 mm. The patient expressed unfamiliarity with the planned UVATS procedure and required explanation about the process and follow-up care. O: During the UVATS procedure, an incomplete interlobar fissure between the upper and middle lobe and abnormal lobulation of the upper lobe were noted. A modified marionette technique was utilized involving the insertion of an internal organ retractor and the use of looped 1-0 nylon-threaded 18-gauge injection needles. The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and a 4-cm skin incision was made in the sixth intercostal space at the anterior axillary line for the main port. A: Primary diagnosis is lung adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe. The UVATS procedure was completed with modifications due to anatomical variations. The assessment during surgery did not indicate any immediate complications from the procedure. P: The patient is scheduled for regular follow-up appointments to monitor for complete tumor removal and to check for any postoperative complications. The patient will be provided with detailed information regarding the schedule and nature of these follow-ups. Further education on the procedure and postoperative care will be provided as needed to ensure understanding and compliance. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello! You mentioned that you came in for an evaluation and treatment for eyebrow alopecia. Can you tell me more about that and if you've experienced any other hair loss on your body? Patient: Hi, doctor. Yes, I've noticed my eyebrows have been thinning, but I haven't experienced hair loss anywhere else on my body. Doctor: Alright. Have you done anything to your eyebrows in the past, like plucking them with tweezers? Patient: Yes, I used to shape my eyebrows by plucking them with tweezers. Doctor: Do you have any other medical conditions or concerns that you'd like me to be aware of? Patient: No, I don't have any other medical conditions. Doctor: Okay, let me examine your eyebrows and other areas on your body to check for any signs of alopecia. *Examines patient* I see sparse and thin black hairs on your eyebrows but no signs of hair loss elsewhere, such as your frontal hairline or temporal area.  Patient: That's good to hear. Doctor: Based on my examination, I'm diagnosing you with idiopathic eyebrow hypotrichosis. I'm going to prescribe you a bimatoprost 0.03% solution to apply to the affected areas daily.  Patient: Okay, thank you. Doctor: Just so you know, improvement in your eyebrow hypotrichosis will be gradual, so you'll need to be patient. I'd like to see you for periodic follow-up visits every two months to monitor your progress. Patient: Alright, that sounds reasonable. Doctor: *During follow-up visits* How has your compliance with the daily application of the bimatoprost 0.03% solution been? Patient: I've been using it once a day as you instructed. Doctor: Great! I can see increased hair growth and thickening of your eyebrow hairs. Have you experienced any treatment-associated side effects? Patient: No, I haven't had any side effects from the treatment. Doctor: That's excellent! After eight months, it looks like you have complete regrowth of your eyebrows. We'll continue with the daily topical treatment of bimatoprost 0.03% solution to maintain these results. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'm really happy with the progress and the treatment. [/INST] S: The patient, a female with no significant medical history, presented with the chief complaint of eyebrow thinning, specifically noting no other areas of hair loss on her body. She reported a history of eyebrow plucking, which could be relevant to her current condition. O: Physical examination revealed sparse and thin black hairs on the eyebrows with no signs of hair loss on the frontal hairline or temporal areas. No other abnormalities were noted during the examination. The patient has been using bimatoprost 0.03% solution daily as prescribed, with no reported side effects. A: The primary diagnosis is idiopathic eyebrow hypotrichosis. The patient's history and clinical findings support this diagnosis, with no evidence of other dermatological or systemic diseases contributing to the hair loss. The prognosis is good, given the positive response to treatment observed during follow-up. P: The management plan includes continued daily application of bimatoprost 0.03% solution to the affected areas to maintain hair regrowth. The patient is scheduled for periodic follow-up visits every two months to monitor progress and adherence to the treatment regimen. Education on the gradual nature of treatment response and encouragement of patient compliance have been emphasized. No referral to other specialties is needed at this time. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. I see you were admitted to the emergency department with a complaint of palpitations that started a few hours ago. Can you describe the palpitations for me? Patient: Hi, doctor. Yeah, my heart has been beating really fast and irregularly for the past few hours. It's quite uncomfortable. Doctor: I understand. We've done a 12-lead ECG, which suggests that you have atrial fibrillation. I also noticed in your medical history that you've been taking oral anticoagulation therapy for recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation and topiramate for essential tremor in your arms. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. I've had these issues before, and the medications help manage them. Doctor: After you were admitted, we administered an intravenous dose of amiodarone to help with your current symptoms. Your new 12-lead ECG is now compatible with atrial flutter, having a cycle length of 240 ms and a 4:1 atrioventricular response. Patient: Oh, okay. What does that mean? Doctor: Atrial flutter is a different type of abnormal heart rhythm, but it's related to atrial fibrillation. The cycle length and atrioventricular response we observed indicate that your heart rhythm has changed, but it's still not regular. Patient: I see. So, what's the next step? Doctor: We wanted to further evaluate the underlying heart rhythm, so we performed a two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2D TTE) on you. This is an ultrasound of your heart to see how it's functioning. Patient: And what did you find? Doctor: We measured the transmitral flow using pulsed-wave Doppler and found a diastolic pattern with a normal atrial rhythm. This means that your heart is functioning relatively well despite the abnormal rhythm. Patient: That's a relief. What do we do now? Doctor: We will continue to monitor your heart rhythm and adjust your medications as needed. It's important for you to keep taking your prescribed medications and follow up with your cardiologist regularly for further evaluation and management. Patient: Alright, doctor. I appreciate your help. I'll make sure to follow up with my cardiologist and take my medications as prescribed. Doctor: You're welcome. If you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns, do not hesitate to contact your healthcare team or come back to the emergency department. Take care and stay safe. [/INST] S: The patient, a female with a history of recurrent atrial fibrillation and essential tremor, presented to the emergency department with palpitations described as fast and irregular, which started a few hours prior to admission. She reports discomfort associated with these symptoms. The patient confirms ongoing treatment with oral anticoagulation therapy and topiramate. O: Initial 12-lead ECG indicated atrial fibrillation. Post-administration of intravenous amiodarone, a follow-up 12-lead ECG showed atrial flutter with a cycle length of 240 ms and a 4:1 atrioventricular response. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2D TTE) revealed a diastolic pattern with a normal atrial rhythm, indicating relatively good cardiac function despite the abnormal rhythm. A: The primary diagnosis is atrial flutter, previously managed as atrial fibrillation. The patient's heart function is stable as evidenced by the 2D TTE findings, but the presence of atrial flutter necessitates ongoing monitoring and possible adjustment of her current therapeutic regimen. P: Continue monitoring the patient's heart rhythm and adjust medications as necessary. The patient is advised to adhere strictly to her prescribed medication regimen and schedule regular follow-up visits with her cardiologist. She is also instructed to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or new concerns arise. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you were admitted to our hospital due to ecchymosis on both lower extremities. Can you tell me more about your medical history? Patient: Yes, three years before admission, I was diagnosed with ITP through laboratory tests, including antibodies against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and GP IV, and bone marrow aspiration. I was treated successfully with corticosteroids. I also have a history of nontuberculosis mycobacterial infection. Doctor: I see. What treatment were you on before coming here? Patient: I was taking prednisolone, clarithromycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol hydrochloride. Doctor: Okay. I have your recent examination results here. Two weeks before admission, your platelet counts were normal, at 185 × 10^9/l. However, on admission, your laboratory findings showed a significant drop in platelet count, to 3.0 × 10^9/l. Your biochemical parameters and coagulation values were within the normal limit, and antibodies against Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and HIV were negative. Based on this, we diagnosed you with acute exacerbation of chronic ITP. Patient: Oh, no. What will be my treatment now? Doctor: We started you on high-dose IVIG, PSL (40 mg/day), and romiplostim (1 µg/kg). However, during the next four days, you developed respiratory failure with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of approximately 250. We performed a computed tomography (CT) on the fourth day of hospitalization, which revealed ground-glass opacities with marginal infiltration in both lung fields. This led us to diagnose you with alveolar hemorrhage.  Patient: That's terrible. What happened next? Doctor: As your dyspnea worsened gradually, we initiated noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) to help you breathe. On the 11th day of hospitalization, we increased the dose of romiplostim to 10 µg/kg and administered pulsed doses of methyl-PSL (1000 mg/day for 3 days) along with a second cycle of IVIG. Patient: Did that help? Doctor: Yes, by the 21st day of hospitalization, your platelet count recovered, and you were discharged without any complications. Patient: That's a relief. What's my current situation? Doctor: Your platelet count has remained normal while being treated with 12.5 mg of prednisolone. We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as necessary. Make sure to attend any follow-up appointments and report any new symptoms or concerns. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and will make sure to follow your instructions. [/INST] S: The patient, previously diagnosed with Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) and treated with corticosteroids, was admitted with ecchymosis on both lower extremities. The patient reported a history of nontuberculosis mycobacterial infection and was on prednisolone, clarithromycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol hydrochloride prior to admission. O: On admission, the patient's platelet count was significantly reduced to 3.0 × 10^9/l from a previous normal count of 185 × 10^9/l. Biochemical parameters and coagulation values were normal. Tests for Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis C and B viruses, and HIV were negative. CT imaging on the fourth day showed ground-glass opacities with marginal infiltration in both lung fields, indicative of alveolar hemorrhage. The patient developed respiratory failure with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of approximately 250. A: The primary diagnosis is an acute exacerbation of chronic ITP, complicated by alveolar hemorrhage. The patient's history of ITP and recent exacerbation, along with the development of respiratory complications, guided the diagnosis and treatment. P: Treatment initiated with high-dose IVIG, PSL (40 mg/day), and romiplostim (1 µg/kg), escalated to 10 µg/kg due to worsening condition. Pulsed doses of methyl-PSL (1000 mg/day for 3 days) and a second cycle of IVIG were administered. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) was used for respiratory support. The patient's treatment will continue with monitoring and adjustments as necessary, including maintaining a dose of prednisolone at 12.5 mg. Follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor the patient's condition and platelet count. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've been admitted to our clinic for delivery at the 37th week of your gestation. Can you tell me a bit about your pregnancy history?  Patient: Sure, this is my sixth pregnancy. I have two children and had three abortions. I also had one previous cesarean section delivery. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. I have your preoperative blood test results here. Your hemoglobin is 10.8 g/dL, prothrombin time (PT) is 10.5 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 29 seconds, international normalized ratio is 2.3, and platelet count is 385x109/L. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: We also performed a transabdominal sonography and magnetic resonance imaging on you. The results show total placenta previa and myometrial invasion to the urinary bladder at the anterior wall of your uterus.  Patient: Oh, that sounds concerning. Doctor: Yes, it can be. You mentioned earlier that you would prefer a conservative approach rather than hysterectomy in case of massive bleeding, is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: After the cesarean delivery of your baby through a Pfannenstiel incision and removal of the placenta, we detected a 5-6 cm area of tissue loss at the anterior wall of the uterus. There was also bleeding from the cervix and posterior wall of the bladder. Patient: Oh no, what did you do? Doctor: We applied pelvic packing on the pelvic vessels for 20 minutes and sutured the bleeding sites with 1.0 polyglactine sutures. We also placed a Sengstaken-Blakemore balloon catheter in the uterus before suturing. Patient: And did that help? Doctor: We filled the stomach balloon with 250 mL saline and the esophageal balloon with 400 mL saline to provide compression on the lower uterine isthmic and cervical bleeds. However, bleeding continued. Patient: What happened next? Doctor: Bilateral uterine and hypogastric artery ligations were planned due to the hemorrhage. During the procedure, the left external iliac artery was accidentally held and bonded as the left hypogastric artery, but we released it within a minute after distinguishing the vessels. Patient: Oh, I see.  Doctor: Following that, we successfully ligated the uterine and hypogastric arteries on both sides. You lost about 2000 cc of blood due to the intraoperative hemorrhage, which we measured by adding 1650 cc blood in the aspirator and counting the gauzes. Patient: That's a lot of blood. Doctor: Yes, it is. We gave you erythrocyte suspension (3 units preoperatively and 4 unites postoperatively) and 3 packs of fresh frozen plasma to help with the blood loss. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all that you did to help me during the delivery. [/INST] S: The patient, a 37-week pregnant woman with a history of two live births, three abortions, and one previous cesarean section, presented for delivery. She expressed a preference for conservative management over hysterectomy in the event of massive bleeding. O: Hemoglobin was 10.8 g/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 10.5 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 29 seconds, international normalized ratio (INR) 2.3, and platelet count 385x10^9/L. Imaging revealed total placenta previa and myometrial invasion into the urinary bladder. During cesarean delivery, a 5-6 cm area of tissue loss at the anterior wall of the uterus was noted, with bleeding from the cervix and posterior bladder wall. Pelvic packing and suturing were performed, followed by placement of a Sengstaken-Blakemore balloon catheter. Despite these measures, bleeding continued, leading to bilateral uterine and hypogastric artery ligations. The patient lost approximately 2000 cc of blood. She received 3 units of erythrocyte suspension preoperatively and 4 units postoperatively, along with 3 packs of fresh frozen plasma. A: The patient was diagnosed with total placenta previa and myometrial invasion, complicated by significant intraoperative hemorrhage. The accidental temporary bonding of the left external iliac artery was promptly corrected. The patient's condition stabilized following the surgical interventions. P: Continue monitoring hemoglobin levels and coagulation parameters closely. Administer iron supplements and consider additional blood transfusions if necessary. Provide postoperative care including pain management and infection prevention. Schedule follow-up appointments for wound care and psychological support considering the traumatic nature of the delivery. Educate the patient on signs of infection or complications to watch for during recovery. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I've been informed that you were referred here for the evaluation of radicular pain you've been experiencing over the posterior aspect of your right leg and numbness at the planter aspect of your right foot. Can you tell me how long you've been experiencing this discomfort? Patient: Yeah, it's been going on for about 3 weeks now. Doctor: I see. I also noted that you have a history of being injured by missile fragments 11 years before your admission. Can you tell me more about that? Patient: Sure, I'm in the military and got injured during a mission. I've had some issues since then, but this pain is new. Doctor: Okay. Your previous doctor suspected a probable diagnosis of S1 root radiculopathy from L5–S1 disc herniation and performed a lumbar myelography, which came back normal. However, since you still have discomfort, they referred you to our institution. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: I conducted a neurological exam and found distal sciatica along the course of your S1 root, with hypoesthesia of your right sole. Upon further examination and palpation, I discovered a painful and pulsatile mass in your popliteal region. I also heard a bruit during auscultation. Based on these findings, I suspected a pseudoaneurysm and ordered a selective angiography. Patient: Oh, what did that reveal? Doctor: The angiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm arising from the proximal segment of your anterior tibial artery. The artery appears to be bowed due to the compressive effect of the pseudoaneurysms. Patient: So, what does that mean? Doctor: Considering there was a difference between the size of the aneurysm in angiography and the size of the mass during palpation, I ordered a contrasted CT scan to estimate the exact size of the aneurysm. The scan showed a large isointense mass with rim enhancement surrounding a hyperdense area. The rim is compatible with the pseudocapsule of the aneurysm. The isointense mass is an old clot, and the hyperdense area is the patent part of the aneurysm. Patient: That sounds pretty serious. What's the next step? Doctor: We will need to consult with a vascular specialist to discuss treatment options for the pseudoaneurysm. You may require surgical intervention. In the meantime, we will continue to monitor your condition and manage your pain. Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. I appreciate your thorough evaluation and explanation. Doctor: You're welcome. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. We'll be here to help you through this process. [/INST] S: The patient, a military personnel, reports experiencing radicular pain along the posterior aspect of the right leg and numbness on the plantar aspect of the right foot for 3 weeks. The patient has a history of injury from missile fragments 11 years ago, which has caused ongoing issues, though the current symptoms are new. Previous diagnosis by another doctor suggested S1 root radiculopathy from L5-S1 disc herniation, but lumbar myelography was normal. O: Neurological examination revealed distal sciatica along the S1 root and hypoesthesia of the right sole. A painful, pulsatile mass was palpated in the popliteal region, with an audible bruit on auscultation. Selective angiography showed a pseudoaneurysm arising from the proximal segment of the anterior tibial artery, with the artery bowed due to the compressive effect of the pseudoaneurysms. A contrasted CT scan confirmed a large isointense mass with rim enhancement surrounding a hyperdense area, indicative of an old clot and the patent part of the aneurysm. A: The primary diagnosis is a pseudoaneurysm of the anterior tibial artery, likely secondary to previous trauma and causing compression of nearby structures, including the S1 nerve root. This condition explains the patient's symptoms of radicular pain and numbness. Differential diagnosis initially included S1 radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation, which was ruled out by normal myelography. P: The management plan includes referral to a vascular specialist for evaluation and potential surgical intervention for the pseudoaneurysm. Pain management will continue, and the patient's condition will be closely monitored. The patient has been advised to reach out with any further questions or concerns as we proceed with treatment planning. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you have a 10-year history of BD. Have you been receiving any treatment for it recently? Patient: No, I haven't been treated for it in the last 2 years. Doctor: I see. So, you've been referred to our cardiovascular surgery department with symptoms of serious aches in your left arm, edema, and apparent veins on your left anterior chest wall, is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: We performed a color Doppler ultrasonography of your left upper extremity venous system, and it showed a total thrombosis of the left internal and external jugular veins and the left subclavian vein. To treat this, we ordered a single dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (7500 IU/0.3 mL of bemiparin sodium) for a day, along with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. How have you been feeling since your discharge from the hospital? Patient: Well, a month after I was discharged, I started experiencing dyspnea and coughs. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. During your physical examination, we found decreased occultation sounds in the middle and bottom fields of your left thorax. A posteroanterior direct chest radiograph also showed a consolidated region, which is in line with the auscultation findings. We performed thoracocentesis and aspirated a milky liquid from your left thorax. The biochemical analysis of the liquid demonstrated total protein of 4.3 g/dL, albumin of 2.2 g/dL, total cholesterol of 47 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 287 mg/dL. Patient: Hmm, what does that mean? Doctor: In light of these findings, we have diagnosed you with chylothorax. We've hospitalized you and started a treatment plan that includes single doses of LMWH, 0.5 mg of colchicine, 40 mg of an oral corticosteroid (prednisolone), 2 doses of oral immunosuppressive therapy (50 mg of azathioprine), and a high-carbohydrate and low-fat dietary regimen. We've also established a left thoracic drainage system for you. Patient: Okay, and how has that been working? Doctor: On the seventh day of hospitalization, we noticed a progressing cheilosis flow and decided to apply a pleurodesis process with talcum powder. However, the chylothorax progression continued for the following 3 days. We then decided to inject 60 mL of venous autologous blood into your left thorax via a drainage tube, which we clamped to avoid any further complications. Patient: So, what's the next step in my treatment? Doctor: We will continue to monitor your progress, adjust your medication and dietary regimen as needed, and perform any necessary procedures to manage your chylothorax. It's important that you follow our recommendations and keep us informed of any changes in your symptoms. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help you through this process. [/INST] S: The patient reports a 10-year history of BD (Bipolar Disorder) without recent treatment. He was referred for serious aches in the left arm, edema, and visible veins on the left anterior chest wall. Post-discharge from initial treatment, the patient started experiencing dyspnea and coughs. O: Color Doppler ultrasonography revealed total thrombosis of the left internal and external jugular veins and the left subclavian vein. Initial treatment included 7500 IU/0.3 mL of bemiparin sodium, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Physical examination showed decreased occultation sounds in the middle and bottom fields of the left thorax. Chest radiograph indicated a consolidated region in the left thorax. Thoracocentesis aspirated a milky liquid, with biochemical analysis showing total protein 4.3 g/dL, albumin 2.2 g/dL, total cholesterol 47 mg/dL, and triglycerides 287 mg/dL. Current treatment includes LMWH, 0.5 mg colchicine, 40 mg prednisolone, 50 mg azathioprine, a high-carbohydrate and low-fat diet, and a left thoracic drainage system. Pleurodesis with talcum powder was performed, followed by injection of 60 mL of autologous blood into the left thorax. A: The patient is diagnosed with chylothorax secondary to venous thrombosis. The progression of chylothorax despite initial interventions including pleurodesis and autologous blood injection indicates a complex case requiring ongoing management. P: Continue monitoring the patient's condition and adjust the medication and dietary regimen as necessary. Maintain the left thoracic drainage system and perform additional procedures to manage chylothorax as required. Emphasize the importance of compliance with the treatment plan and encourage the patient to report any changes in symptoms. Regular follow-ups are scheduled to assess progress and make necessary adjustments to the treatment plan. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I've just been informed that your 19-year-old son has been admitted to the intensive unit after a suicide attempt by hanging. I'm very sorry to hear that. Can you tell me if he was found in cardiac arrest, and if so, how long do you think it lasted? Family Member: Yes, he was found in cardiac arrest, but we're not sure about the duration. Doctor: I see. During the transfer to the hospital, cardiac massage was performed for 40 minutes to try and revive him. Upon arrival, we assessed his condition and found him to be in a deep coma with a Glasgow score of 3/15. That's a very low score and indicates a severe brain injury. Family Member: Oh no... What did the tests show? Doctor: We performed an unenhanced Brain Computed Tomography (CT) after five hours. The images demonstrated bilateral hypodensity in the basal ganglia, which can be seen as the white arrowheads. There was also hyperdensity in the cerebral arteries, which seems to be related to the underlying brain hypodensity. This is likely due to a decrease in gray-white differentiation caused by edema, or swelling, in the brain. Family Member: What happened next? Doctor: We continued to monitor his condition and performed another unenhanced CT after 30 hours. Unfortunately, there was progression of brain edema, causing a collapse of the sylvian fissures, basal cisterns, and cortical sulci. These are indicated by the black arrows in the images. Family Member: And what does that mean? Doctor: This also led to diffuse hyperdensity of all collapsed subarachnoid spaces, which became prominent and is indicated by the white arrows. This condition is called pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage (PSAH). Family Member: Is there any chance of recovery? Doctor: We conducted multiple evoked potential tests after 48 hours to assess his brain function. I'm very sorry to inform you that the tests have confirmed that he is brain dead. Family Member: Oh no... I can't believe this is happening. What do we do now? Doctor: I understand this is an extremely difficult time for you and your family. Our team will provide you with all the necessary support and information to help you through this process. We'll discuss the next steps and address any concerns or questions you may have. [/INST] S: The patient, a 19-year-old male, was admitted following a suicide attempt by hanging. He was found in cardiac arrest, although the duration is unclear. Upon admission, he was in a deep coma with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3/15, indicating severe brain injury. O: Initial unenhanced Brain CT showed bilateral hypodensity in the basal ganglia and hyperdensity in the cerebral arteries, suggesting edema and decreased gray-white differentiation. A follow-up CT 30 hours later indicated progression of brain edema, collapse of sylvian fissures, basal cisterns, and cortical sulci, and diffuse hyperdensity of all collapsed subarachnoid spaces, consistent with pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage (PSAH). Evoked potential tests conducted after 48 hours confirmed brain death. A: The primary diagnosis is brain death secondary to anoxic brain injury following a suicide attempt by hanging. The findings on CT and evoked potential tests support this diagnosis. Differential diagnosis would consider other causes of coma, but clinical findings and imaging are conclusive for brain death. P: The management plan includes providing support and information to the family to help them through this process. Discussions regarding organ donation, if applicable, and end-of-life care decisions will be facilitated. No further medical interventions are indicated. Referral to counseling services for the family is recommended to aid in coping with the loss. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see that you have a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been feeling really sick for the past 4-5 days. I've had vomiting, nausea, and a really bad headache.  Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about your headache?  Patient: It came on suddenly, and it's really sharp and right at the front of my head. It's been so bad, like an 8 out of 10 on a pain scale.  Doctor: Thank you for the information. Have you experienced any constipation, abdominal pain, or distension in the past few days? Patient: Yeah, I've been constipated for 4-5 days too, but no abdominal pain or distension.  Doctor: Alright. Have you had any visual disturbances, neck pain, neck rigidity, or fever recently?  Patient: No, none of those symptoms.  Doctor: Have you had any recent alcohol intake or unusual food prior to the onset of these symptoms? Patient: No, I haven't had any alcohol or unusual food lately. Doctor: We've checked your vitals and initially you had hypotension with a blood pressure of 68/54 mm Hg. After administering two liters of normal saline infusion, it improved to 94/55 mm Hg. Your physical exam showed dry mucosa but no focal neurological deficits were noted. Patient: Okay, that's good to know. Doctor: We also performed a computed tomography (CT) scan of your head, which was reported to be unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial pathologies. Patient: Hmm, that's a relief. Doctor: Your blood workup showed hyponatremia with a serum sodium level of 128 mmol/L (normal: 137-145 mmol/L) and hypokalemia with a serum potassium level of 3.2 mmol/L (normal: 3.5-5.1 mmol/L). Your serum bicarbonate was 27 mmol/L (normal: 22-30 mmol/L) and serum glucose was 171 mg/dL (normal: 74-105 mg/dL). Your blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels were 56 mg/dL (normal: 9-20 mg/dL) and 3.3 mg/dL (normal: 0.8-1.5 mg/dL), respectively. Patient: Oh, I see. So, what does all of that mean? Doctor: Based on your symptoms and test results, we've admitted you with an initial impression of acute kidney injury secondary to acute volume depletion resulting from vomiting. We have initiated aggressive hydration to help correct this issue, as well as replacing your electrolytes. Patient: Okay, I hope that helps me feel better.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I have reviewed your medical history, and it seems that you've been experiencing mild low back pain for the past 3 years. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, that's correct. But in the last 20 days, the pain has worsened severely, and it's now radiating to the back of my lower limbs. I've also had a lot of difficulty walking. Doctor: I see. When I examined your lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints, I found that the palpation was painful, which is a positive Patrick's test. We also did some laboratory analysis, and your inflammatory markers, such as reactive C protein, were found to be normal. Are you aware of any other health issues or habits that could be related to your condition? Patient: Well, I am a heavy smoker, but I don't have any other comorbidities. Doctor: Thank you for that information. We performed an MRI, which demonstrated an infiltrative mass affecting the vertebral body and pedicles of your L4 vertebra. There was also heterogeneous enhancement after the contrast administration. The tumor has extended into the distal third of your inferior vena cava and the left iliopsoas muscle. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We also performed a CT scan, which showed a lytic lesion with indistinct borders in the vertebral body of your fourth lumbar vertebra (L4). There was a soft tissue component that dislocated the aorta and the inferior vena cava. Additionally, there was a typical ""ring-and-arc"" chondroid matrix mineralization in the L4 vertebral body. Patient: What does this all mean, doc? Doctor: We decided to perform a needle transpedicular biopsy of the vertebral lesion to better understand your condition. The biopsy revealed a malignant infiltrative bone neoplasm with chondroid differentiation and several areas of necrosis. Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: Three weeks after the needle biopsy, we performed a posterior lumbar approach, installing pedicle screws at L3 and L5, and removed the posterior elements. We also dissected the anterior large vessels from the spine and performed an ""en bloc"" resection of L4. We reconstructed your lumbar spine with a titanium cage and an anterolateral plate. Patient: And what were the results of that? Doctor: The histopathological examination of the resected L4 vertebral body revealed an infiltrative malignant biphasic neoplasia composed of ample ill-defined areas. Patient: What does this mean for my future treatment? Doctor: We will need to discuss further treatment options, including potential chemotherapy and radiation therapy, to target and manage the malignant neoplasm. It is crucial that you follow up with your medical team regularly to monitor your progress and adjust treatment as necessary. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance throughout this process. [/INST] S: The patient reports a history of mild low back pain for the past 3 years, which has severely worsened in the last 20 days, now radiating to the back of the lower limbs and causing difficulty walking. The patient is a heavy smoker with no other reported comorbidities. O: Physical examination revealed pain on palpation of the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints, with a positive Patrick's test. Laboratory analysis showed normal inflammatory markers, including reactive C protein. MRI and CT scans identified an infiltrative mass in the L4 vertebral body, extending into the inferior vena cava and left iliopsoas muscle, with lytic lesions and ""ring-and-arc"" chondroid matrix mineralization. A needle transpedicular biopsy indicated a malignant infiltrative bone neoplasm with chondroid differentiation. Post-surgical histopathology confirmed infiltrative malignant biphasic neoplasia. A: The primary diagnosis is a malignant infiltrative bone neoplasm with chondroid differentiation at the L4 vertebra. Differential diagnoses could include other types of primary spinal tumors or metastatic disease. The prognosis depends on the response to further oncological treatments and the extent of disease spread. P: The patient underwent surgical resection of the L4 vertebra and spinal reconstruction. The next steps include discussing additional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Regular follow-ups with the oncology team are essential to monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. Smoking cessation should be strongly advised to support overall health and treatment efficacy. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, we have a report of a 6-year-old boy who was admitted to the emergency unit due to severe hypothermia and unconsciousness. Can you tell me if he had any medical history that we should be aware of? Patient's Parent: No, his medical history was not contributive. Doctor: Okay. It seems that he was transferred here by a mobile emergency medical service. Upon admission, we assessed his vital parameters and clinical examination. His Glasgow Coma Scale score was 5/15 with fixed dilated pupils, a core rectal temperature of 27.2°C, and SpO2 of 98% with supplemental oxygen. He also had irregular respiration, sinus bradycardia at 60 bpm, normal blood pressure of 98/72 mmHg with a mean blood pressure of 79 mmHg, and a prolonged capillary refilling time of 4 seconds. Additionally, there was muscle rigidity and obvious hypotrophy.  Patient's Parent: Oh my, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it is quite concerning. During admission, we performed rapid-sequence intubation and non-invasive rewarming. We also administered fluid replacement boluses of normal saline to help stabilize him.  Patient's Parent: Okay, thank you for doing that. How are his blood test results? Doctor: His blood gas and first laboratory assessments within 8 hours of admission showed a compensated metabolic acidosis, hyperlactatemia with a lactatemia level of 5.5 mmol/L (normal is less than 2 mmol/L), and hyperglycemia at 340 mg/dL (normal range is 70-100 mg/dL). He also has mild thrombocytopenia with a count of 124,000/µL (normal range is 150,000-440,000/µL). Patient's Parent: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What about his other test results? Doctor: There were elevated biomarkers of myocardial and muscular damage such as serum CK-MB, which was up to 2,262 UI/L (normal is less than 190 UI/L), myoglobin at 1,978 ng/mL (normal is less than 72 ng/mL), and troponin at 684 ng/L (normal is less than 14.0 ng/L). Additionally, there was a mild alteration of coagulation screening with PT at 51% (normal is more than 70%) and INR at 1.46 (normal range is 0.95-1.31). He also has hypertransaminasemia with AST up to 2,700 UI/L (normal is less than 40 UI/L) and ALT up to 2,000 UI/L (normal is less than 41 UI/L). Fortunately, his renal and pancreatic functions are normal. Patient's Parent: I see. What are the next steps for his treatment and recovery? Doctor: We will continue to monitor his vital signs and blood test results closely. He may require further interventions and treatments depending on his progress. It's important to keep a close eye on his condition and follow up with any necessary medical care. Patient's Parent: Thank you, Doctor. We appreciate all your efforts in treating our son. Please keep us updated on his condition. [/INST] S: A 6-year-old boy was admitted with severe hypothermia and unconsciousness. The patient's parent reported no significant medical history.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello there, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having some discomfort in my groin area lately. Doctor: Alright, let me start by conducting a physical examination to better understand the situation. Is that okay with you? Patient: Yes, sure. Doctor: (After examining) Based on the physical examination, your phenotype seems like that of a 3-year-old boy with a normal size penis. I found a palpable testis in your left groin and a nonpalpable undescended testis on the right side. Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean? Doctor: It means that one of your testes hasn't descended to its proper location in the scrotum. We may need to do further tests like an MRI to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Patient: Okay, I understand. (After the MRI) Doctor: The MRI results show that your left testis is located in the left hemiscrotum, measuring 1.3 × 0.6 cm. It's associated with a mild hydrocele. Another testis, measuring 1.2 × 0.6 cm, was found on the ipsilateral side within the left inguinal canal. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: This means that both of your testes are on the same side, one above the other, which is unusual. We'll need to perform an exploration of the left groin to determine the cause of this and to plan the necessary treatment. Patient: Alright, let's do that then. (After the exploration) Doctor: During the exploration, we found the presence of both testes within the same side. Each testis has separate vasa deferentia and testicular vessels, but they share a common cremasteric muscle and tunical covering.  Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: The next step is to perform a herniotomy. After the procedure, the ectopic testis will be fixed transseptally to the right hemiscrotum. This should help alleviate your discomfort and allow your testes to function properly. Patient: Will there be any long-term effects from the herniotomy? Doctor: The procedure is generally safe and effective, and most patients recover well. We'll monitor your progress and provide any necessary follow-up care. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, a 3-year-old boy, reports discomfort in the groin area. He has no other symptoms mentioned. O: Physical examination revealed a palpable testis in the left groin and a nonpalpable undescended testis on the right side. MRI findings confirmed the left testis in the left hemiscrotum, measuring 1.3 × 0.6 cm with a mild hydrocele, and another testis measuring 1.2 × 0.6 cm in the left inguinal canal. Surgical exploration showed both testes on the same side, each with separate vasa deferentia and testicular vessels, sharing a common cremasteric muscle and tunical covering. A: The primary diagnosis is bilateral cryptorchidism with ectopic testis. The presence of both testes on the same side with shared anatomical features is unusual and requires surgical intervention to prevent complications such as infertility and increased risk of testicular cancer. P: The management plan includes performing a herniotomy to reposition the ectopic testis transseptally to the right hemiscrotum. Post-operative care will involve monitoring for recovery and effectiveness of the procedure, with follow-up visits to assess testicular function and position. Education will be provided to the parents about the importance of follow-up and potential long-term effects. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me how you're feeling right now and what symptoms you've experienced? Patient: Yeah, I developed nausea, vomiting, headache, chest tightness, and shortness of breath while working outdoors for 2 hours in a southern city in China. It was a hot afternoon, the temperature was 35°C. I'm originally from the north part of China, you know. Doctor: I see. What happened after you experienced these symptoms? Patient: After around 15 hours, I went into a coma and was then transferred to the emergency department of the hospital. Doctor: We've done some tests since you arrived. Upon arrival, your temperature was 40.2 °C, blood pressure was 75/40 mmHg, and pulse rate was 100 beats/min. Your blood oxygen saturation under balloon-assisted ventilation was 95%.  Patient: Oh, that sounds bad. Doctor: Yes, we also performed some laboratory tests, which indicated rhabdomyolysis syndrome, acute kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. Your serum D-dimer level was elevated at 1022 μg/L, while the normal range is 0–232 μg/L. Based on these findings, we diagnosed you with Heatstroke (HS). Patient: Oh no! So, what are you doing to treat me? Doctor: We've been treating you with a cooling blanket and plasma exchange, along with assisted ventilation to help stabilize your condition. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: On the 3rd day of your admission, we performed brain CT scans, which showed symmetrical low-density lesions in the bilateral basal ganglia. On the 7th day, your state of consciousness improved, but you mentioned having blurred vision, right? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: We did an eye examination, and the results were normal. To get a better understanding of your brain, we performed a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 8 days after admission. Patient: What did the MRI show? Doctor: The cerebral MRI revealed a slight hyperintensity in the bilateral putamen on the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequence and bilateral symmetrical hypointensity in the middle of the putamen and hyperintensity around the hypointensity on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) sequences. Patient: I don't really understand all that. What does it mean for me? Doctor: These MRI findings suggest that there are some changes in your brain due to the heatstroke. We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide appropriate treatment as needed. It's important to follow up with us regularly to ensure your recovery. Patient: Okay, I understand. Thanks for explaining everything to me, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help you through your recovery. [/INST] S: The patient, a male from northern China, reported experiencing nausea, vomiting, headache, chest tightness, and shortness of breath after working outdoors for 2 hours in a hot environment (35°C) in southern China. Symptoms escalated to a coma approximately 15 hours later, prompting emergency hospitalization. O: Upon hospital admission, the patient's vital signs were critical with a temperature of 40.2°C, blood pressure at 75/40 mmHg, and pulse rate at 100 beats/min. Blood oxygen saturation was maintained at 95% with balloon-assisted ventilation. Laboratory tests indicated rhabdomyolysis syndrome, acute kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. Serum D-dimer was significantly elevated at 1022 μg/L (normal range 0–232 μg/L). Brain CT and MRI findings showed symmetrical low-density lesions in the bilateral basal ganglia and slight hyperintensity in the bilateral putamen, among other abnormalities. A: The primary diagnosis is Heatstroke (HS), complicated by multi-organ dysfunction including rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and hepatic dysfunction. The brain imaging findings suggest potential neurological damage secondary to HS. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of altered mental status and multi-organ failure, but clinical presentation and context strongly support HS. P: The patient is being managed with a cooling blanket, plasma exchange, and assisted ventilation. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, organ functions, and neurological status is essential. Regular follow-ups are scheduled to assess recovery and manage any long-term complications. Patient education on recognizing and preventing heatstroke, especially considering his non-acclimatization to southern climates, is crucial. Referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and management of neurological symptoms is recommended. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you've been referred to our hospital due to an increase in size of a tumor in your vulva. Can you tell me when you first noticed this mass? Patient: Hi, yes. The mass was first pointed out to me during my delivery one year ago. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any symptoms related to this mass? Patient: No, I haven't had any apparent symptoms. Doctor: Okay. We did a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of your pelvis, which showed a well-circumscribed mass in the vulva. To address this issue, you underwent a resection of the tumor, and we performed a histological examination on it. I'm glad to report there's been no apparent evidence of recurrence one year after the resection. Patient: That's good to hear. What did the examination show? Doctor: Grossly, the tumor mass was located in the subcutis and measured 73×29 mm. There was no fibrous capsule, but the tumor was well circumscribed. The cut surface showed a yellowish-white mass with gelatinous change. Importantly, no hemorrhage or necrosis was observed. Patient: Hmm, okay. And what about the histopathological examination? Doctor: On histopathological examination, the boundary between the tumor and adjacent tissue was clear. The tumor cells were short and spindle-shaped without prominent atypia. No necrosis or mitoses were identified. The stroma was edematous and myxoid, with fine collagen as well as dense collagen detected in some regions. Patient: What about the blood vessels in the area? Doctor: The vast majority of blood vessels were small-sized with thin walls. Some medium-sized blood vessels were also identified within the lesion. There was no specific distribution pattern of the vascularity. Patient: Did you perform any immunohistochemical studies? Doctor: Yes, we conducted immunohistochemical studies using the primary antibodies listed in the report. On immunohistochemical analysis, most tumor cells showed positivity for vimentin, ER, PgR, and desmin. Some tumor cells were positive for alpha-SMA and CD34. The tumor cells were uniformly negative for S100 protein. Patient: What about the Ki-67 labeling index? Doctor: The Ki-67 labeling index was less than 2%, which is a good sign. Patient: That's a relief. What are the follow-up requirements for my case? Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition through regular checkups and imaging studies to ensure there's no recurrence of the tumor. Make sure to report any new symptoms or changes in your health. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all the information and care. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care. [/INST] S: The patient, a female who noticed a mass in her vulva first pointed out during delivery one year ago, reports no symptoms associated with the mass. O: MRI of the pelvis revealed a well-circumscribed mass in the vulva. Resection of the tumor was performed, and histological examination showed a subcutaneous tumor measuring 73×29 mm, with a yellowish-white, gelatinous cut surface, no fibrous capsule, hemorrhage, or necrosis. Histopathological analysis indicated short, spindle-shaped tumor cells without prominent atypia or mitoses, and an edematous, myxoid stroma with varying collagen density. Immunohistochemical studies showed positivity for vimentin, ER, PgR, desmin, alpha-SMA, and CD34, with negativity for S100 protein. The Ki-67 labeling index was less than 2%. A: The patient was diagnosed with a benign spindle cell tumor of the vulva, likely a myxoid type based on histopathology and immunohistochemistry. The low Ki-67 index and absence of atypia or mitoses suggest a low risk of malignancy and recurrence. P: The management plan includes regular follow-up visits and imaging studies to monitor for any recurrence of the tumor. The patient is advised to report any new symptoms or changes in health immediately. Further consultations with oncology may be considered if any changes are detected during follow-up. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 64-year-old man who has been referred to our institution due to cholelithiasis. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: During our examination, we incidentally found an aortic arch anomaly, KD with an ARSA (orifice diameter of 30 mm) and a distal arch aneurysm (diameter of 55 mm) (Fig.). It seems difficult to expose and directly manipulate the orifice of the ARSA.  Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for my treatment? Doctor: In our institution, we routinely perform extra-anatomical subclavian artery bypass in TAR to simplify the surgical technique. We've decided to proceed with a hybrid TAR with bilateral extra-anatomical axillary artery bypass (adding extra-anatomical right axillary artery bypass) to avoid a deep and difficult end-to-end anastomosis of the ARSA. Patient: Hmm, okay. What does the procedure involve? Doctor: First, we'll connect two pieces of branch grafts (9 mm) to both your left and right axillary arteries, which will be connected to a selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) circuit. Then, we'll perform a median sternotomy. Patient: Median sternotomy? What's that? Doctor: It's a surgical procedure where we'll make an incision down the middle of your chest to access your heart and lungs. The ARSA is deeply located at just the right side of the main bronchus. We'll then initiate cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) via the ascending aorta and the superior and inferior venae cavae. A left ventricle vent will be inserted from the right superior pulmonary vein during systemic cooling. Patient: So, what happens after that? Doctor: We'll clamp the ascending aorta and achieve cardiac arrest with an antegrade cardioplegic solution. Then, the proximal anastomosis will be performed using a 4–0 prolene. When the temperature reaches 28°C, we'll start a hypothermic circulatory arrest with retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) to protect your brain and flush out atheromatous debris from the arch vessels. Patient: That sounds intense. What about the aneurysm and the ARSA? Doctor: Inside the aorta, we'll find many red-colored thrombi in the orifice of the ARSA. We'll ligate the ARSA just at the right side of the main bronchus and the left subclavian artery at the region of origin. Patient: I see. And after the surgery? Doctor: We'll closely monitor your recovery and provide you with any necessary follow-up care. It's a complex procedure, but our team is well-equipped and experienced to handle it. Patient: Thank you for explaining everything to me. I feel more informed and confident in the plan now. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any more questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. [/INST] S: The patient is a 64-year-old male presenting with cholelithiasis and incidentally discovered aortic arch anomaly, specifically Kommerell's diverticulum (KD) with an aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA) and a distal arch aneurysm. He expresses understanding and concern about the planned procedures. O: Examination revealed an ARSA with an orifice diameter of 30 mm and a distal arch aneurysm with a diameter of 55 mm. The patient is scheduled for a hybrid total arch replacement (TAR) with bilateral extra-anatomical axillary artery bypass. The procedure involves connecting branch grafts to both axillary arteries, median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, and hypothermic circulatory arrest with retrograde cerebral perfusion. A: Primary diagnosis is aortic arch anomaly with ARSA and distal arch aneurysm. The complexity of the ARSA's location and the presence of the aneurysm necessitate a hybrid TAR with extra-anatomical bypass and specific surgical techniques to manage the risks associated with these anomalies. P: The management plan includes performing a hybrid TAR with bilateral extra-anatomical axillary artery bypass. Surgical steps include median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, and hypothermic circulatory arrest. Postoperative care will involve close monitoring and follow-up to manage recovery. The patient has been informed about the procedure details and expressed confidence in the treatment plan. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, what brings you to the ophthalmologic out-patient department today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been experiencing mild horizontal diplopia in the left direction for about 3 days now, and then a headache started 17 days later. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any nasal obstruction, epistaxis, nasal discharge, pain, hyposmia, or nasal swelling? Patient: No, none of those symptoms. Doctor: And have you had a history of fever, weight loss, or nocturnal sweating? Any history of diabetes, hypertension, or any neurological disease? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those either. Doctor: Alright, let's proceed with a physical examination. Your cardiopulmonary examination is normal, and I don't observe any lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Now, let me perform a neuroophthalmologic examination. Your visual acuity, fields, and fundi appear normal. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light and near stimuli. There is no ptosis, but I do notice a limitation of movement in your left eye when you gaze to the left side. The function of the remaining cranial nerves is normal. There are no sensory or motor deficits in your upper and lower extremities, and all tendon reflexes are normal. It seems you have isolated left abducens nerve palsy. Patient: Oh, I see. What's the next step? Doctor: We'll need to conduct a computed tomography (CT) scan to get a better understanding of the issue. The CT scan revealed soft-tissue density neoplasms filling your sphenoidal sinus. We also performed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with gadolinium injection, which showed a homogeneous mass lesion measuring 2.8cm x 2.3cm x 2.9cm occupying the sphenoidal sinus and invading and destroying the clivus. Patient: That doesn't sound good. What does it mean? Doctor: We performed a rhinoendoscopy and found a mass in your sphenoidal sinus. We biopsied it, and the histological examination revealed a malignant lymphoma. The immunohistochemical staining of the tumor tissues showed CD3+, CD56+, Ki67>80%, LCA+, CD38+, and CD20−. The lymphoma cells were positive for EBER in situ hybridization. The pathological diagnosis is extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKL). Patient: Oh, no. What now? Doctor: Your plasma EBV PCR yielded 1.18 x 106 copies/ml. Ten days later, you presented with B symptoms such as fever and night sweats. We checked the enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, bilateral subclavian, alar, and inguinal areas. A contrast-enhanced CT showed renal metastases. Patient: This is a lot to take in. What's the plan for treatment? Doctor: We understand this is a difficult situation. Your healthcare team will discuss your treatment options and develop a plan tailored to your needs. We'll be here to support you and your family throughout the process. [/INST] S: Patient reports experiencing mild horizontal diplopia predominantly in the left direction for the past 3 days, accompanied by a headache that started 17 days later. Denies any nasal symptoms such as obstruction, epistaxis, discharge, pain, hyposmia, or swelling.

No lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly noted. Neuroophthalmologic examination shows normal visual acuity, fields, and fundi. Pupils are equal and reactive to light and near stimuli. No ptosis observed, but there is a limitation of movement in the left eye on lateral gaze, indicating isolated left abducens nerve palsy. Remaining cranial nerves function normally. No sensory or motor deficits in extremities, and all tendon reflexes are normal. CT scan revealed soft-tissue density neoplasms in the sphenoidal sinus. MRI with gadolinium showed a homogeneous mass lesion (2.8cm x 2.3cm x 2.9cm) in the sphenoidal sinus, invading the clivus. Histological examination of biopsied mass confirmed malignant lymphoma with immunohistochemical staining positive for CD3+, CD56+, Ki67>80%, LCA+, CD38+, CD20−, and EBER. Plasma EBV PCR yielded 1.18 x 10^6 copies/ml. Contrast-enhanced CT showed renal metastases. A: Primary diagnosis is extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKL), with complications including renal metastases and isolated left abducens nerve palsy. Differential diagnosis initially considered included other causes of diplopia and headache, but imaging and biopsy confirmed ENKL. P: Plan to discuss treatment options with the healthcare team, focusing on tailored chemotherapy and possibly radiation therapy considering the aggressive nature of ENKL and presence of metastases. Patient education regarding the diagnosis, treatment options, and potential outcomes is crucial. Referral to oncology for specialized care and possible enrollment in clinical trials.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you are a 56-year-old male patient diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma in March 2014, along with multinodular hepatic metastasis. How have you been feeling lately? Patient: Honestly, it's been tough. I've been feeling weak and tired most of the time. Doctor: I understand. I see that you first went through chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX for four months, but it was discontinued due to systemic toxicity. How did you feel during that treatment? Patient: It was really rough for me, felt sick all the time. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. After the FOLFIRINOX, you were then switched to chemotherapy with gemcitabine for another four months. How was your experience with that treatment? Patient: It was a bit better than the FOLFIRINOX, but still not great. Doctor: According to your records, after the gemcitabine treatment, you presented partial response of the pancreatic tumor, but there was progression of hepatic lesions and worsening of tumor markers, with CA19.9 increasing from 2,100 to 18,000 U/mL. An abdominal MRI after the second-line systemic chemotherapy showed growth of secondary hepatic lesions in segments II, IVa, VII, and VI, despite the chemotherapeutic management. In an Oncology multidisciplinary meeting, it was decided to perform SIRT. Have you noticed any changes in how you feel since the SIRT? Patient: I feel somewhat better after the SIRT, but still not great. Doctor: I see. Well, the good news is that three months after the SIRT, your MRI showed virtually complete necrosis of the lesions that were observed in the previous MRI. Moreover, there were necrotic areas not showing the previous lesions. These findings may correspond to necrosis of recent secondary lesions or from the hepatic parenchyma. There's also a wedge-shaped hyperenhancement area that stands out around the lesion in segment VII. Patient: So, does that mean my condition is improving? Doctor: It appears that the SIRT has been effective in treating some of the hepatic lesions. However, we will need to continue monitoring your progress and adjust your treatment plan as necessary. Patient: What's the next step for me, doctor? Doctor: We will schedule follow-up appointments and imaging studies to observe the status of your hepatic lesions and pancreatic tumor. Depending on the results, we may need to consider additional treatments or modifications to your current plan. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. We will do our best to help you manage your condition. If you have any concerns or further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

The patient felt slightly better with gemcitabine but still not great. He reports some improvement after SIRT but still feels not great. O: Initial chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX was discontinued due to toxicity. The patient was then treated with gemcitabine, showing partial response in the pancreatic tumor but progression in hepatic lesions and worsening tumor markers (CA19.9 increased from 2,100 to 18,000 U/mL). Post-second-line chemotherapy, abdominal MRI revealed growth of secondary hepatic lesions in segments II, IVa, VII, and VI. Post-SIRT, MRI showed virtually complete necrosis of these lesions and additional necrotic areas, suggesting effectiveness of SIRT. A wedge-shaped hyperenhancement area was noted around the lesion in segment VII. A: The primary diagnosis is pancreatic adenocarcinoma with hepatic metastasis. The patient has undergone multiple lines of chemotherapy with partial response and significant side effects. Recent SIRT treatment shows promising results with significant necrosis of hepatic lesions. Continuous monitoring is necessary to assess the progression of the disease and effectiveness of the treatment. P: The plan includes scheduling follow-up appointments and imaging studies to monitor the status of hepatic lesions and pancreatic tumor. Depending on the outcomes, adjustments to the treatment plan may be necessary. The patient will be informed about potential additional treatments based on the progression and response to the current treatment. Continuous support and information will be provided to address any concerns or questions from the patient. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I understand you're an independent 48-year-old female who has presented here today with a 3-week history of slurred speech, unsteadiness, and fatigue. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Are you currently taking any medications? Patient: I only take occasional iron supplements, but no regular medications. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history? Patient: I've had iron deficiency anaemia and a melanoma that was removed 13 years ago. Doctor: Thank you for that information. Is there anything else I should know about your medical history? Patient: Well, a year prior to this presentation, I had a 4-week admission where I experienced lingering depressive and anxiety symptoms after a presumed viral infection 6 months earlier. I had lethargy, intermittent headaches, nausea, diarrhoea, and unintentional weight loss of 16 Kg over a 6-month period. Doctor: And what was the outcome of that admission? Patient: Following a biochemical assessment, endoscopy, colonoscopy, and a CT abdomen, I was diagnosed with an episode of major depression and started on an antidepressant. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. During your clinical examination today, we noticed that you demonstrated ataxia, as you were unable to walk heel-to-toe, had a negative Romberg's test, and showed subtle dysarthria. We didn't find any other focal neurology during the neurologic examination, and your cardiorespiratory examinations were unremarkable. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We arranged a CT brain for you, and it identified multifocal haemorrhagic sites in the right cerebellar and both cerebral hemispheres. The largest was a 3-cm right cerebellar lobar bleed. The report suggests differential diagnoses of haemorrhagic metastases, possibly recurrent melanoma, or an atypical presentation of amyloid angiopathy. Patient: That sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it does require further investigation. We have started you on dexamethasone and referred you to the neurosurgical department. They will perform a staging CT chest/abdomen and pre-operative stealth brain MRI to further assess the right cerebellar lesion and obtain a histological diagnosis. Patient: What did the MRI show? Doctor: The MRI confirmed multiple supra- and infratentorial lesions. Haemosiderin staining was seen in multiple sulci at the vertex, which is in keeping with a low volume of subarachnoid blood. A 4 mm posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm was also detected. Patient: And what about the CT chest? Doctor: The CT chest identified a mass in the left atrium, which is concerning for an atrial myxoma. We will continue to investigate and determine the best course of action for your treatment. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: 48-year-old female presents with a 3-week history of slurred speech, unsteadiness, and fatigue.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I'm here to discuss your case. We have a report of a 69-year-old Sri Lankan Tamil man who presented to the toxicology unit following a wasp sting. Can you tell me what happened? Patient: Yes, doctor. I was stung by three wasps in the evening. After that, I started having slurred speech, my mouth deviated to the left side, and I felt weakness on the right side of my body. Doctor: I see. Did you have any local reaction at the sites of the wasp sting or any anaphylaxis? Patient: There was a mild local reaction, but no anaphylaxis. Doctor: Good to know. Were you experiencing any other chronic medical illnesses before this event? Patient: No, doctor. I was apparently well before this. Doctor: On admission to the toxicology unit, you were conscious and rational. You were neither pale nor plethoric. Your pulse was 80 beats per minute and your blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg. The clinical examination showed no cardiac murmurs or carotid bruits. You had expressive aphasia, right-side upper motor neuron-type facial nerve palsy, with grade four weakness on the right side of your body. We also checked your random blood sugar on admission, and it was 121 mg/dL. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: We performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your brain, which revealed an acute infarction in the left posterior frontal white matter. This is compatible with your clinical presentation. Your complete blood count showed a hemoglobin of 13.6 g/dL and a platelet count of 350 × 109/L. Your clotting profile was within normal limits. Patient: I see. Doctor: We also conducted an electrocardiogram (ECG) which showed a sinus rhythm, and a two-dimensional echocardiogram indicated normal results with good left ventricular systolic function. Your carotid duplex showed anatomically normal carotid arteries. Your fasting blood sugar was 4 mmol/L. Patient: Alright. Doctor: Your total cholesterol was 148 mg/dL, and your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was 90 mg/dL. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 11 mm in the first hour. Your renal functions were normal. Patient: That's good to hear. Doctor: We have started you on aspirin and atorvastatin as part of your treatment plan. Rehabilitation has been arranged, including physiotherapy and speech therapy. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I hope these therapies will help me recover. Doctor: Yes, they should help with your recovery process. We also visited your place of residence to check for any potential hazards and to ensure proper care. Patient: I appreciate that, doctor. Thank you for all your help. Doctor: You're welcome. We will continue to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I will do that. [/INST] S: A 69-year-old Sri Lankan Tamil man reports being stung by three wasps, followed by slurred speech, deviation of the mouth to the left, and right-sided body weakness. He denies any history of chronic medical illnesses and anaphylaxis following the sting. O: On examination, the patient was conscious, rational, with a pulse of 80 bpm and blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. Clinical findings included expressive aphasia, right-side upper motor neuron-type facial nerve palsy, and grade four right-sided weakness. MRI of the brain showed an acute infarction in the left posterior frontal white matter.

ECG and echocardiogram were normal, and carotid duplex showed normal arteries. A: The primary diagnosis is acute ischemic stroke, likely precipitated by the wasp sting. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of acute neurological deficits, but clinical findings and imaging confirm stroke. P: Initiated treatment with aspirin and atorvastatin. Rehabilitation includes physiotherapy and speech therapy. The patient's living environment has been assessed for safety. Ongoing monitoring and adjustments to the treatment plan will be made as necessary, with encouragement for the patient to report any new symptoms or concerns. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Patient: Hi doctor, I just came to the emergency department because I've been experiencing some red and painful areas on my legs for the past five days. They're also quite swollen. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me when this issue started? Patient: It began one day after I received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Doctor: Did you have any issues with vaccinations during your childhood? Patient: No, I had all my vaccinations as a child without any complications. Doctor: Have you had any recent infections like COVID-19, sore throat, or diarrhea? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those infections. Doctor: Have you ever experienced similar skin lesions or any systemic diseases before? Patient: No, this is the first time I've had any skin issues. Doctor: Did you use any topical or systemic medication recently? Patient: No, I haven't used any medication. Doctor: Do you have any family history of tuberculosis or have you been in contact with any sick patients recently? Patient: No, there's no family history of tuberculosis and I haven't been in contact with any sick patients. Doctor: Let me examine your skin. [Examines patient] I see multiple tender and erythematous nodules on both of your legs. Based on your history, examination, and laboratory investigation, it appears that this could be vaccine-related erythema nodosum. However, we must also consider the possibility of an Arthus-like phenomenon that can mimic erythema nodosum lesions. Patient: Oh, I see. What can be done to relieve my symptoms? Doctor: I'll prescribe you oral ibuprofen 600 mg to be taken four times daily. This should help relieve your symptoms. Patient: Okay, thank you. [Three days later] Patient: Hi doctor, I just wanted to let you know that since starting the treatment, my symptoms have improved and the nodules started to flatten. Doctor: That's great to hear. Please come back for a follow-up examination in two weeks. [Two weeks later] Patient: Hi doctor, I'm happy to report that my symptoms have completely resolved. Doctor: That's excellent news! I'm glad that the treatment worked and your condition has improved. If you have any further issues or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. [/INST] S: Patient, a recent recipient of the Pfizer vaccine, reports red, painful, and swollen areas on the legs starting one day post-vaccination. Denies previous similar issues, recent infections, or use of medications. No family history of tuberculosis or recent contact with sick patients.

Advised to reach out if further issues or concerns arise. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that you've been transferred to our department with a diagnosis of unstable angina pectoris. You have CAD risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, smoking, and hypertension. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: We performed a percutaneous coronary intervention to address this issue. Our expert operator guided the attending physician, who has 3 years of interventional experience. We conducted a coronary angiography through your right radial artery, which showed a 70% occlusion in the proximal segment of your left main anterior coronary artery (LM) and a 90% occlusion in the proximal segment of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD).  Patient: Oh, okay. Doctor: We initially used a diagnostic catheter (6F TIG, TERUMO, Japan) which was withdrawn, and then advanced a hydrophilic guidewire (Merit Laureate; Merit Medical, USA). Unnoticed, it strayed into the distal right IMA. When the guiding catheter (6F EBU3.5, Medtronic, USA) was advanced over the guidewire, you complained of intolerable chest pain. Do you remember that? Patient: Yes, I remember the chest pain. Doctor: We immediately withdrew the guiding catheter and guidewire, then reintroduced the guidewire into the aortic sinus. We delivered the guiding catheter to the left coronary artery and performed balloon dilatation and stenting of the LM and LAD. During that time, you again complained of severe chest pain, and your blood pressure began to fall.  Patient: Yeah, it was really painful. Doctor: Your condition deteriorated despite the administration of opioid analgesics and intravenous fluids. We performed a transthoracic echocardiography to rule out cardiac tamponade and aortic dissection, which it did.  Patient: What did you find then? Doctor: Fluoroscopy suggested a right-sided pleural haemothorax (Fig. c). We conducted an IMA angiography that revealed obvious exudation of contrast in the third rib segment of the right IMA. To address this issue, we introduced a 2.0 mm × 15 mm semi-compliant balloon (MINI TREK, Abbott, IL, USA) up to the site of the leak and kept it inflated for 20 minutes to reduce the exudation. Patient: Did it help? Doctor: Yes, bleeding was finally staunched by embolization with coils (Fig). It's important for you to continue monitoring your symptoms and follow up with us as needed. We'll keep a close eye on your condition and work together to manage your CAD risk factors. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of diabetes mellitus, smoking, and hypertension, presented with unstable angina pectoris. He reported severe chest pain during a percutaneous coronary intervention. O: The coronary angiography revealed a 70% occlusion in the proximal segment of the left main anterior coronary artery and a 90% occlusion in the proximal segment of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Intervention included the use of a diagnostic catheter and a hydrophilic guidewire, followed by balloon dilatation and stenting. The patient experienced severe chest pain and hypotension during the procedure. Transthoracic echocardiography ruled out cardiac tamponade and aortic dissection. Fluoroscopy identified a right-sided pleural haemothorax. IMA angiography showed contrast exudation at the third rib segment of the right IMA, which was managed with a semi-compliant balloon and coil embolization. A: The primary diagnosis is unstable angina pectoris complicated by a procedural iatrogenic right-sided pleural haemothorax. Differential diagnoses initially included cardiac tamponade and aortic dissection, which were ruled out by echocardiography. P: The patient's management included withdrawal and repositioning of the catheter and guidewire, balloon dilatation, stenting, and embolization of the bleeding site. Ongoing management will focus on monitoring symptoms, managing CAD risk factors, and regular follow-ups to assess and address any further complications. The patient is advised to continue with prescribed medications, maintain a heart-healthy diet, and avoid smoking. Further consultations with cardiology and possibly a pulmonologist are recommended to ensure comprehensive care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there! So, you've presented to our urology out-patient clinic with purulent discharge from the distal part of the dorsum of your penis. Can you tell me more about when this started? Patient: Yeah, it started about 6 months ago after I had a circumcision at a different hospital. Doctor: I see. And what's your medical and social history like? Any issues in the past? Patient: No, nothing remarkable. I'm potty-trained and my developmental milestones and psychosocial status are all good. Doctor: Great. And there's no consanguinity between your parents, right? No inherited diseases in the family? Patient: That's correct, no issues there. My mom had an uneventful pregnancy with me too. Doctor: Alright. So, you mentioned that various antibiotics were used to treat the purulent discharge, but it's been continuing for 6 months. Were there any complaints before the circumcision? Patient: No, I didn't have any complaints before that. Doctor: Upon admission, we recorded your temperature as 36.4 °C, pulse at 98 beats/minute, and blood pressure at 80/50 mmHg. Your condition was reported as superficial dorsal venous thrombosis, known as Mondor disease (MD), based on magnetic resonance imaging from the previous hospital. Our physical examination revealed a small pinhole lesion at the distal part of your penis and a rigid cylindrical tube extending to the proximal side of the penis. Patient: Oh, okay. Doctor: Now, in the laboratory analysis, your total white blood cell count was 6.1 × 103/mm3, hemoglobin was 13.2 g/dL, alanine aminotransferase was 19 u/l, aspartate aminotransferase was 21 u/l, and creatinine was 0.5 mg/dl. Your serological tests were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV), and anti-HIV. Patient: That's good to know. Doctor: Yes, it is. Your urine analysis showed normal amounts of red cells with suspicion of urinary tract infection. However, since you were treated with various antibiotics regimens, no bacterial growth was detected in the swab culture samples obtained from the fistula mouth. Patient: I see. Doctor: We also performed a genitourinary system ultrasonography which revealed no additional anomalies. Fistulography/sinography showed that there was no relationship between your urinary tract and the sinus. Patient: So, what's the plan for treatment? Doctor: In your case, we'll proceed with surgical exploration as the treatment for your condition. We'll continue to monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. I appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help. [/INST] S: The patient, a male who underwent circumcision 6 months ago, presents with persistent purulent discharge from the distal dorsum of the penis. He reports no prior complaints before the circumcision and has no significant medical or family history. He has been treated with various antibiotics without resolution of symptoms. O: Vital signs upon admission were: temperature 36.4 °C, pulse 98 beats/minute, blood pressure 80/50 mmHg. Physical examination revealed a small pinhole lesion and a rigid cylindrical tube along the penis. Laboratory results showed WBC 6.1 × 10^3/mm^3, hemoglobin 13.2 g/dL, ALT 19 u/l, AST 21 u/l, creatinine 0.5 mg/dl. Serological tests for HBsAg, HCV, and HIV were negative. Urine analysis was normal with no bacterial growth in culture. MRI indicated superficial dorsal venous thrombosis (Mondor disease). Ultrasonography and fistulography confirmed no urinary tract involvement. A: The primary diagnosis is Mondor disease with a complication of a persistent sinus tract post-circumcision. Differential diagnoses were considered but ruled out based on imaging and lab results. P: The management plan includes surgical exploration to address the sinus tract. Post-operative monitoring and adjustment of treatment will be necessary based on the patient's recovery and response to the surgical intervention. Further antibiotic therapy will be guided by clinical progress and any new culture results. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you were referred to our hospital with suspected interstitial pneumonia in a health examination in 2013. How have you been feeling lately? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I have a slightly dry cough, but other than that, I've been feeling okay. Doctor: Have you been experiencing any desaturation or difficulty breathing? Patient: No, not really. Doctor: I see. I noticed in your records that you've worked as a plasterer for more than 40 years. Did you use any protective equipment during your work? Patient: No, I didn't use any protective equipment. Doctor: Okay. During the examination, we performed chest auscultation and noticed slight bilateral inspiratory fine crackles in the bilateral lower lung zones. We also conducted a chest X-ray, which showed enlarged hilar lymph nodes and mild reticular opacities, mainly in the upper to middle lung fields of both lungs. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We performed a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan, which suggested a predominantly subpleural distribution of irregular linear opacities and reticulonodular shadows with interlobular septal thickening in both lung fields. However, your pulmonary function tests were close to normal, and your six-minute walking test during admission was also normal. Patient: That's a relief, at least. Doctor: In 2014, we noticed that your forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) had decreased. The reticulonodular shadows on your HRCT scan had worsened as well. Patient: But I haven't felt any worse in terms of my symptoms. Doctor: That's interesting to note. Your thoracic symptoms had not deteriorated, and your vital signs remained stable. To establish a diagnosis, we performed VATS from the right S2 segment of the upper lung lobe and the right S9 segment of the lower lung lobe. Patient: What did you find? Doctor: We observed dense fibrosis with mononuclear cell infiltration and inorganic dust particles around the respiratory bronchioles in the upper lung lobe S2 segment, which is consistent with MDP. Additionally, we detected fibrously thickened interlobular septa and visceral pleura accompanied by dust, including some birefringent particles suggestive of silicates, and fibroblastic foci within these lesions. Patient: And what about the lower lung lobe? Doctor: In the lower lung lobe S9, we found extensive honeycomb changes with dilated bronchioles and parenchymal collapse, as well as fibroblastic foci within the cystic wall. Patient: So, what does this all mean, Doctor? Doctor: It means that your years of exposure to dust particles without proper protective equipment may have contributed to these findings in your lungs. We will need to monitor your condition closely and discuss potential treatment options to manage your symptoms and prevent further damage to your lungs. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, a former plasterer with over 40 years of experience and no history of using protective equipment, presents with a chief complaint of a dry cough. He denies experiencing desaturation or difficulty breathing. He was previously referred with suspected interstitial pneumonia in 2013. O: Physical examination revealed slight bilateral inspiratory fine crackles in the lower lung zones. Chest X-ray showed enlarged hilar lymph nodes and mild reticular opacities in the upper to middle lung fields. HRCT scan indicated subpleural irregular linear opacities, reticulonodular shadows, and interlobular septal thickening in both lung fields. Pulmonary function tests were near normal, and a six-minute walking test was normal. VATS biopsy from the right upper and lower lung lobes showed dense fibrosis, mononuclear cell infiltration, inorganic dust particles, and fibroblastic foci, consistent with mixed dust pneumoconiosis (MDP). A: The primary diagnosis is mixed dust pneumoconiosis, likely due to prolonged occupational exposure to dust without protective measures. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of interstitial lung disease, but the biopsy findings are highly suggestive of MDP. The prognosis depends on the progression of the lung disease and the effectiveness of the management plan. P: The management plan will include regular monitoring of lung function and symptoms, pulmonary rehabilitation, and consideration of pharmacological treatment to manage symptoms and slow disease progression. The patient will be educated on the importance of avoiding further dust exposure and on recognizing symptoms of disease progression. Referrals to a pulmonologist and an occupational health specialist are recommended to optimize care and explore potential occupational disease compensation. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 59-year-old male who is scheduled for an elective open retropubic prostatectomy. This is because you have a benign enlarged prostate weighing approximately 65 grams. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: I also see that your weight is 89 kg and you have an ASA physical status II. You were diagnosed with essential hypertension two years ago, and it's controlled with Ramipril 10 mg once daily. Are there any other morbidities or medications you're taking? Patient: No, that's the only issue I have, and Ramipril is the only medication I take. Doctor: Great. Your preoperative assessment did not reveal any other abnormalities related to anesthesia, and your vital signs were normal. You also stopped taking Ramipril for 48 hours before the operation, as advised. Your baseline laboratory results were normal, including your renal profile: creatinine 87 micromole/L, urea 7.9 mmol/L, Na 140 mmol/L, and K 4.1 mmol/L.  Patient: Okay, so everything seems fine so far. Doctor: Yes, it does. After discussing the anesthesia plan with you and the surgical team, it was decided to go with general anesthesia (GA) and postoperative patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine for pain management.  Patient: Alright, I understand. Doctor: The induction of GA was done using propofol (2mg/kg), fentanyl (100 micrograms), and rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg), followed by endotracheal intubation. We also inserted a radial arterial cannulation for IBP monitoring and two wide-bore peripheral cannulas (18G).  Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: However, during the induction, you experienced hypotension (BP dropped from 112/68 to 73/46) and bradycardia (HR dropped from 78/min. to 38/min.). We administered two successive 6 mg doses of ephedrine, which restored your BP and HR. Patient: Oh, I see. Did everything go back to normal after that? Doctor: Yes, your baseline arterial blood gas (ABG) after positioning was normal. At 2 hours into the surgery, the estimated blood loss was about 350 ml and the urinary output was 120 ml over the 2 hours. Your mean arterial pressure (MAP) was maintained above 70 mmHg without further vasopressors required, other than the initial 12 mg of ephedrine. Patient: That's good to know. Doctor: However, an arterial blood gas performed 2 hours after the start of surgery, done to monitor your haemoglobin level, showed that you had developed hyperkalaemia (6.1 mmol/L). Patient: Oh no, what does that mean? Doctor: Hyperkalaemia is a higher-than-normal level of potassium in the blood, which can cause complications if not managed properly. We will monitor and address this issue to ensure your safety. Patient: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Doctor: You're welcome. We will continue to monitor your condition and provide necessary care during your recovery. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. Patient: I appreciate that. Thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient is a 59-year-old male scheduled for an elective open retropubic prostatectomy due to benign prostatic hyperplasia with a prostate weight of approximately 65 grams. He reports controlled essential hypertension treated with Ramipril 10 mg daily, which was stopped 48 hours prior to surgery. No other morbidities or medications were reported. O: Preoperative assessment showed normal vital signs and laboratory results, including creatinine 87 micromole/L, urea 7.9 mmol/L, Na 140 mmol/L, and K 4.1 mmol/L. During induction of general anesthesia, the patient experienced hypotension (BP dropped to 73/46) and bradycardia (HR dropped to 38/min), which were corrected with ephedrine. Estimated blood loss during surgery was 350 ml, and urinary output was 120 ml over 2 hours. An arterial blood gas performed 2 hours into the surgery revealed hyperkalaemia (K 6.1 mmol/L). A: The primary diagnosis is benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient experienced intraoperative hypotension and bradycardia, likely related to anesthesia, which responded to ephedrine. He also developed hyperkalaemia during surgery, which needs to be monitored and managed. P: Continue to monitor vital signs and electrolytes closely, particularly potassium levels. Manage hyperkalaemia as per standard protocols. Postoperative pain management includes patient-controlled analgesia with morphine. The patient should resume Ramipril as advised postoperatively, considering his hypertension history. Provide patient education on signs of complications and ensure follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor recovery and manage any arising issues. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that your younger sister is 41 years old and a housewife, is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: I see that she is considered obese according to the Japanese criteria, with a height of 156 cm and weighing 69.6 kg. Her waist circumference is 102 cm and her visceral fat area is 164.2 cm2, calculated employing abdominal CT. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: It appears that she has had slightly impaired fasting glucose levels on her medical check-ups for the past 3 years, but she hasn't consulted a doctor about this issue. Is that right? Patient: Yes, she didn't consult any doctor about it. Doctor: I also noticed that she has experienced repeated falls and injuries for the past 5-6 years. Can you tell me more about that? Patient: Yes, she has been falling and getting injured quite often in recent years. Doctor: Your sister married at the age of 37 and underwent infertility treatment. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's true. Doctor: When she was admitted for detailed examination to our hospital, she showed distal muscle weakness of the four extremities, handgrip myotonia, and distal muscle atrophy, which are consistent with the characteristics of DM1. Were you aware of this? Patient: Yes, we were informed about that. Doctor: Her laboratory data showed elevated fasting glucose levels with dyslipidemia, which met the Japanese criteria for metabolic syndrome (MetS). An oral glucose tolerance test using 75 grams of glucose showed impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). As a result, we started treatment with diet and exercise. Are you following the prescribed treatment plan? Patient: Yes, she has been following the diet and exercise plan. Doctor: Due to the presence of MetS, we conducted a sleep study using an apnomonitor Type 4. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was quite high at 55.9, indicating severe sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) with an AHI of 30 or more. However, there were no signs of snoring, apneic episodes, nocturnal dyspnea, or daytime somnolence. Were you aware of her sleep issues? Patient: No, we didn't know about her sleep issues until now. Doctor: Her arterial blood gas (ABG) test showed hypoxia accompanied by hypercapnia. Furthermore, her lung function test, using spirometry, revealed a decreased percent predicted vital capacity. This indicates some issues with her respiratory system. We will need to monitor and address this as part of her treatment plan. Patient: I see. Thank you for informing us about this. We will make sure to follow up on her treatment and monitor her condition closely. Doctor: You're welcome. It's important to keep a close eye on her health and follow the recommended treatment plan. If you have any concerns or notice any changes in her condition, please don't hesitate to contact us. [/INST] S: The patient's younger sister, a 41-year-old housewife, is obese with a history of slightly impaired fasting glucose levels for the past 3 years, which were not previously addressed with a doctor. She has experienced repeated falls and injuries over the last 5-6 years and has undergone infertility treatment. She has been following a prescribed diet and exercise plan for metabolic syndrome (MetS) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). O: The patient's sister has a height of 156 cm, weight of 69.6 kg, waist circumference of 102 cm, and visceral fat area of 164.2 cm2. She exhibits distal muscle weakness, handgrip myotonia, and distal muscle atrophy, indicative of DM1. Laboratory data show elevated fasting glucose levels and dyslipidemia. An oral glucose tolerance test confirmed IGT. A sleep study revealed severe sleep apnea syndrome (AHI 55.9) without typical symptoms like snoring or daytime somnolence. Arterial blood gas test indicated hypoxia with hypercapnia, and spirometry showed reduced vital capacity. A: Primary diagnosis is DM1 with complications including MetS, IGT, severe sleep apnea syndrome, and respiratory dysfunction. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of muscle weakness and metabolic abnormalities. P: Continue with the current diet and exercise regimen.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you were brought to the emergency department following a car accident. Can you tell me what happened? Patient: Yeah, I was stepping into a car when a 5-ton water tanker rolled over my lower body. Doctor: That sounds serious. We assessed your condition when you arrived. Your Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 15, with a pulse rate of 80 beats per minute and your blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg. We noticed profuse bleeding due to a perineum injury. Did you experience any pain in your head or neck? Patient: No, I didn't feel any pain there. Doctor: That's good to know. We performed X-rays and found no fractures of the skull, cervical spine, and pelvis. We also performed urinary catheterization without difficulty, and there was no hematuria. We conducted an abdominal ultrasound, and it didn't show any internal bleeding. After stabilizing you with fluid and blood replacement, we took you to the operating theatre for injury assessment. Patient: What did you find during the surgery? Doctor: While you were placed in the lithotomy position, we observed anterior displacement of the anus and a circular skin defect surrounding the region. There was 1 cm of normal perianal skin left, with no actual skin loss. We performed a digital and proctoscopy examination which showed an intact anorectum and surrounding sphincters. Patient: What about the wound? Doctor: Upon exploring the wound, we found a complete disruption of the posterior pelvic floor with lateral extensions into both gluteal regions and your right thigh. We could even pass a hand behind the rectum and into the sacral promontory. The case was associated with extensive venous bleeding, but there was an absence of major arterial tears. Patient: How did you manage that? Doctor: We managed it by inserting multiple packs and partially closing the skin defect. We also made a small incision to perform a defunctioning sigmoid colostomy. There was no intra-abdominal bleeding reported. We removed the packs two days later without any bleeding complications. Patient: How much blood did I need? Doctor: During the first 48 hours of your admission, you required a total of 22 units of blood. Patient: Is there anything I should know about my recovery? Doctor: We will be conducting continuous follow-up examinations to monitor your progress. It's important that you attend these appointments and let us know if you experience any issues or discomfort. We'll be here to support you throughout your recovery. Patient's Family: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate all the care you have provided and will make sure he follows up with all appointments and instructions. [/INST] S: The patient, a victim of a traumatic accident involving a 5-ton water tanker rolling over his lower body, reports no head or neck pain. He was conscious and alert with a GCS of 15 upon arrival at the emergency department. O: Initial assessment showed a pulse rate of 80 bpm and blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. Profuse bleeding from a perineum injury was noted. X-rays revealed no fractures in the skull, cervical spine, or pelvis. Urinary catheterization was performed successfully without evidence of hematuria. Abdominal ultrasound showed no internal bleeding. Surgical findings included anterior displacement of the anus, a circular skin defect around the perineum, complete disruption of the posterior pelvic floor with lateral extensions into both gluteal regions and the right thigh, but no major arterial tears. The patient required 22 units of blood within the first 48 hours. A: The primary diagnosis is severe trauma to the pelvic region with extensive damage to the posterior pelvic floor and associated structures, managed surgically with wound exploration, packing, partial skin closure, and a defunctioning sigmoid colostomy. No internal organ damage or major arterial injury was identified. P: The patient will undergo continuous follow-up examinations to monitor recovery and manage any complications from the trauma and surgeries. It is crucial for the patient to attend all follow-up appointments and report any discomfort or issues.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you were admitted to Chongqing Shapingba District Chenjiaqiao hospital. Can you tell me what happened? Patient: Hi, doctor. I suffered fractures of my left femoral neck after falling to the ground. Doctor: I see. (Looking at Fig. a) It appears you had a left total hip replacement on July 16, 2017, and the X-ray (Fig. b) shows a prosthetic hip in position. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: After the surgery, you were given Cefazolin sodium (1 g IV q8h) for prophylactic administration, and your indwelling urinary catheter was removed after 24 hours. Can you tell me how you felt after surgery? Patient: I felt okay initially, but on the 8th day after surgery, I started to experience left hip pain and some other symptoms. Doctor: What were those symptoms, if you don't mind me asking? Patient: I had a fever of 38.5 °C, redness and swelling around the surgical site (Fig. c), and I also reported local tenderness. Doctor: Thank you for the information. It seems your blood examination demonstrated an increase in white blood cell (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) during the postoperative period. We also conducted screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus infections, which were non-reactive. There was no abnormality in your liver or renal function tests, and your T-lymphocyte subsets and gamma-globulin analysis were within the normal range. Patient: Okay, so what happened next? Doctor: On July 25, 2017, approximately 400-ml of light-yellow, odorless subcutaneous fluid was punctured at your surgical site and sent to the microbiological laboratory for bacterial smear and culture. While a large amount of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) were detected, no microorganism was found on gram-staining smear. Moreover, there was a negative growth on the blood and chocolate agar plates. Patient: What about the repeated blood cultures? Doctor: The repeated blood cultures using the BacT/ALERT 3D blood culture microbial detection system were also negative. Despite these results, a post-surgical infection was still under suspicion. The wound was cleaned with iodophor and drainage.  Patient: Alright, thank you for the information, doctor. What should I do now for follow-up care? Doctor: It's important to monitor your symptoms closely and report any changes or worsening of your condition. Keep the surgical site clean and follow any recommendations provided by your healthcare team. If you notice any redness, swelling, or increased pain, please contact your doctor immediately. [/INST] S: The patient, who previously underwent a left total hip replacement in 2017, presented with complaints of left hip pain starting on the 8th day post-surgery. He also reported a fever of 38.5 °C, redness, swelling, and local tenderness around the surgical site. O: Examination findings included elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, indicating inflammation. Imaging confirmed the position of the prosthetic hip. Approximately 400-ml of light-yellow, odorless subcutaneous fluid was aspirated from the surgical site, showing a large amount of polymorphonuclear leucocytes but no microbial growth on gram stain or culture. Repeated blood cultures were negative. A: The primary diagnosis is suspected post-surgical infection of the left hip despite negative microbial cultures, possibly due to the presence of polymorphonuclear leucocytes and clinical symptoms of infection. Differential diagnoses could include non-infectious post-surgical inflammation or a reaction to the prosthetic material. P: The patient is advised to maintain strict hygiene and monitor the surgical site closely for any signs of worsening infection. Regular follow-up with the healthcare team is essential to manage symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary. Immediate medical attention should be sought for any increase in redness, swelling, or pain. Further diagnostic tests may be required if symptoms persist or worsen. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've presented with a history of low backache for the past one year. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've had typical claudication symptoms, left-sided numbness, and paresthesia of the foot. But I don't have any radicular pain. Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any changes in your symptoms over time? Patient: Yes, there has been a progressive reduction in claudication distance. Also, my gait suddenly got worse, and I started experiencing urinary incontinence after a trivial fall last week. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me share some findings from your examination. You have a bilateral high-stepping gait due to foot drop, symmetrical weakness of both the L4 and L5 roots (MRC grade 0/5), and partial weakness of the S1 root (MRC grade 3/5). You also have nondermatomal sensory disturbances and absent deep tendon reflexes in your lower limbs. Your anal tone is normal, but saddle anesthesia is present.  Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We performed a postvoidal ultrasonogram of your urinary bladder and found a residual urine volume of 250 ml, confirming a neurogenic bladder. We also conducted plain radiography of your lumbar spine, but it didn't show any gross feature of instability and was inconclusive.  Patient: So, what's the issue then? Doctor: We did a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your lumbar spine and found a solitary intraspinal posterior epidural lesion of 1.8 × 1.5 × 0.5 cm at the L2-L3 level. There's also adjacent epidural fatty hypertrophy contributing to severe canal stenosis (3 mm). Your cauda equina is severely compressed and almost not visible. Patient: That sounds serious. Was anything else found? Doctor: Yes, we performed computerized topography (CT) and discovered an osseous lesion attached to the right L2 inferior articular process, causing severe secondary canal stenosis. Due to your recent-onset neurological deficit, we advise you to undergo surgical decompression and excision biopsy at the earliest. Patient: Alright, what will the procedure be like? Doctor: You'll be positioned prone on a Relton Hall frame under general anesthesia. We'll employ a standard midline posterior approach, expose your L2 and L3 lamina, and remove the spinous process. Then, we'll perform the surgical decompression and excision biopsy. Patient: Okay, I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to help you through this process. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. [/INST] S: Patient reports a history of low backache for the past year, progressive reduction in claudication distance, worsening gait, left-sided numbness, paresthesia of the foot, and recent onset of urinary incontinence following a trivial fall. No radicular pain is reported. O: Examination reveals bilateral high-stepping gait, symmetrical weakness of both L4 and L5 roots (MRC grade 0/5), partial weakness of S1 root (MRC grade 3/5), nondermatomal sensory disturbances, and absent deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs. Saddle anesthesia is present, anal tone is normal. Postvoidal ultrasonogram shows a residual urine volume of 250 ml, indicating a neurogenic bladder. Lumbar spine radiography was inconclusive. MRI of lumbar spine shows a solitary intraspinal posterior epidural lesion at L2-L3 (1.8 × 1.5 × 0.5 cm) with severe canal stenosis (3 mm) and severe compression of cauda equina. CT reveals an osseous lesion attached to the right L2 inferior articular process causing severe secondary canal stenosis. A: Primary diagnosis is severe spinal canal stenosis at L2-L3 due to an epidural lesion and osseous growth, resulting in cauda equina syndrome. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of neurogenic claudication and urinary incontinence, but imaging and symptoms strongly support the current diagnosis. P: Plan includes urgent surgical decompression and excision biopsy of the lesion. The procedure will involve general anesthesia, positioning on a Relton Hall frame, and a standard midline posterior approach to expose and operate on L2 and L3. Postoperative care will include monitoring of neurological function and bladder management. Referral to a neurosurgeon has been made, and patient education regarding the procedure and expected outcomes has been provided. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess recovery and any further intervention needed. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've been admitted for the evaluation of heavy proteinuria, deteriorating renal function, and severe hypertension. Can you tell me about your medical history? Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with RA when I was 42. I also had a left vitrectomy for retinal detachment and bilateral femoral head replacement after a fracture when I was 49. I have drug allergies to many drugs. Doctor: I see. Due to your drug allergies, various treatments for RA were introduced, including methotrexate, infliximab, etanercept, salazosulfapyridine, leflunomide, bucillamine, tacrolimus, abatacept, and tocilizumab, in addition to prednisolone and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: You were treated with 2 to 3 mg/day of tacrolimus, which is the standard dose for RA, in addition to 8 mg/day of prednisolone from the age of 48 for 2 years and 3 months. After the introduction of tacrolimus, can you tell me if there were any changes in your blood pressure? Patient: Yes, my BP increased from 120/70 mmHg to 140/80 mmHg after 20 months of tacrolimus treatment. Doctor: I see. During that time, the trough levels of tacrolimus were within acceptable ranges between 5 and 10 ng/dL. Proteinuria began to increase from the baseline proteinuria of 0.3 to 0.5 g/g creatinine 24 months after tacrolimus treatment, but your serum creatinine level was sustained around 0.8 mg/dL. Due to uncontrolled arthritis of RA, tacrolimus and tocilizumab were changed to tofacitinib citrate 27 months after starting tacrolimus treatment. Were there any issues with tofacitinib citrate? Patient: Yeah, I had an allergic reaction to it, so we discontinued it after just 2 months. Doctor: I understand. Proteinuria further increased after the discontinuation of tacrolimus and tocilizumab, and then severe hypertension at 190/100 mmHg and progressive renal dysfunction developed. A 40 mg telmisartan/5 mg amlodipine besilate combination tablet was introduced 2 months after tacrolimus discontinuation. Did you notice any changes in your condition after that? Patient: Not really, my renal function continued to deteriorate and my creatinine level went up to 2.63 mg/dL. Doctor: That's concerning. You were admitted to our hospital 3 months after discontinuing tacrolimus for further evaluation and treatment. Upon admission, your body temperature was 36.5°C and your height was 154 cm. We will closely monitor your condition and work on finding the most appropriate treatment for you. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'm glad to be here and hope we can find a solution soon. [/INST] S: The patient, a 52-year-old with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed at age 42, reports heavy proteinuria, deteriorating renal function, and severe hypertension. The patient has a history of left vitrectomy, bilateral femoral head replacement, and multiple drug allergies. The patient experienced an increase in blood pressure and proteinuria following tacrolimus treatment, which was discontinued due to uncontrolled RA symptoms and replaced with tofacitinib citrate. However, the patient had an allergic reaction to tofacitinib citrate, leading to its discontinuation. The patient's condition did not improve with the introduction of a 40 mg telmisartan/5 mg amlodipine besilate combination tablet, and renal function continued to deteriorate. O: Upon admission, vital signs included a blood pressure of 190/100 mmHg and a body temperature of 36.5°C. The patient's height was recorded at 154 cm. Previous treatments included tacrolimus (2-3 mg/day) and prednisolone (8 mg/day), with tacrolimus trough levels maintained between 5 and 10 ng/dL. Proteinuria increased from a baseline of 0.3 to 0.5 g/g creatinine, and serum creatinine levels rose to 2.63 mg/dL. A: The primary diagnosis is severe hypertension and deteriorating renal function secondary to RA and its treatment. Differential diagnoses may include drug-induced nephropathy and RA-related renal complications. The prognosis is guarded due to the progressive nature of the renal dysfunction and the complexity of managing RA with multiple drug allergies. P: The management plan will include close monitoring of renal function and blood pressure. Adjustments to the current antihypertensive regimen may be necessary, and further evaluation to assess the extent of renal damage is planned. A consultation with a nephrologist will be arranged to explore additional therapeutic options. Patient education will focus on understanding the relationship between RA management and renal health, and strategies to minimize further renal damage. Compliance with the new treatment regimen will be emphasized, and alternative RA treatments will be considered given the patient's history of drug allergies. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi doctor, I came here because I have been experiencing abdominal pain and distention. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a bit about your medical history? Have you had any surgeries or major illnesses? Patient: Well, I had a uterine myomectomy 17 years ago, but that's about it. I don't smoke or drink alcohol. Doctor: Okay. Let's check your vitals. On admission, you don't have a fever, your body temperature is 37.5° C, your pulse rate is 70 beats/minute, and your blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg. We will also perform a neurological examination and some laboratory tests. Patient: Sure, no problem. (After the tests) Doctor: Your neurological examination and laboratory test results, including complete blood count and liver and renal function, are all within normal limits. Now, let's do a physical examination. (After the physical examination) Doctor: Your physical examination showed a distended abdomen with a large tumor extending from the pelvis to the umbilical area. We'll need to do a computed tomographic (CT) scan to get more information. Patient: Oh, okay. I hope it's not something serious. (After the CT scan) Doctor: The CT scan revealed a 14-cm uterine malignant tumor. Additionally, there is a 4-cm isolated splenic nodule suggesting a metastatic lesion. The good news is that the tumor is limited to the uterus and does not extend beyond. Patient: Oh no, what do we do now? Doctor: You will need to undergo radical surgical treatment. This will include a total hysterectomy, total splenectomy, and lymphadenectomy. Patient: I understand. I'm ready to do whatever it takes to get better. (After the surgery) Doctor: The surgery was successful. We removed a huge, whitish, friable tumor occupying the entire uterine cavity, as well as a 4-cm splenic nodule with irregular contours and a heterogeneous aspect. The histopathological analysis showed that you have uterine clear cell carcinoma invading the outer half of the myometrium with negative lymph nodes. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It means that the cancer is classified as stage IB according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classification scheme. The tumor cells do not have estrogen and progesterone receptors but are positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3. Patient: And what about the splenic lesion? Doctor: The splenic lesion consisted of multiple confluent and variably sized fibrotic nodules centered by many vessels. These vessels were surrounded by areas of hemorrhage, fibroblasts, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Patient: So, what's the next step for my treatment? Doctor: We will closely monitor your condition and discuss further treatment options, if necessary. It's important to follow up regularly with your healthcare team to ensure the best possible outcome. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate your help and guidance. [/INST] S: The patient, a female with a history of uterine myomectomy 17 years ago, presents with abdominal pain and distention. She denies smoking and alcohol consumption. O: Vital signs on admission were normal with a body temperature of 37.5° C, pulse rate of 70 beats/minute, and blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg. Neurological examination and laboratory tests including complete blood count, liver, and renal function were within normal limits.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see from your past medical history that you have diabetes. What brings you to the emergency department today? Patient: Well, I've had this left eye pain for the past two days, and now I've got this weird rash on the left side of my neck. Doctor: Hmm, I see. Can you describe the pain you've been experiencing? Patient: It's been intermittent, but when it comes, it's like a shooting, burning pain along the rash. Doctor: Alright, let me examine the rash. It appears to be nonconfluent grouped vesicles on the posterior neck. Based on my examination, I'm diagnosing you with herpes zoster reactivation, or shingles. We'll perform an electrocardiography (EKG) to check for any blocks or evidence of pericarditis.  Patient: Oh, okay. So, what's the treatment for this? Doctor: We'll treat you with valacyclovir and oral steroids. It's also important that you seek urgent ophthalmological evaluation at a specialized center. Patient: Got it, thanks. *Some time later* Doctor: I see you were readmitted in March 2018 with altered mental status. At that time, a new EKG showed a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. Your admission vitals were a blood pressure of 96/58 and heart rate of 65 beats per minute.  Patient: Yeah, I remember that. Doctor: The laboratory studies done on admission were mostly unremarkable except for hypoglycemia at 32. Later that day, you developed bradycardia at 49 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 117/63 mm Hg. A repeat EKG showed a Second Degree AV block (Mobitz I). Patient: Hmm, that sounds serious. Doctor: It's important that we monitor it closely. Did you have any fever, chills, arthralgias, myalgias, vomiting, or diarrhea during that time? Patient: No, I didn't have any of those symptoms. Doctor: And what about chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath? Patient: No, none of those either. Doctor: That's good. We corrected your electrolyte abnormalities and continuously monitored you on telemetry, and followed with serial EKGs. You had a positive chronotropic response with exertion and awakening. An echocardiography done during admission showed preserved left ventricular function (60%) with no wall motion abnormalities and mild grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: We'll have an electrophysiology evaluation, and they've advised outpatient monitoring within two weeks to evaluate for progression. You're not considered to be at high risk of progression due to the preservation of your left ventricular function, but it's important to keep an eye on it. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. [/INST] S: The patient, a known diabetic, presents with left eye pain and a rash on the left side of the neck, described as intermittent, shooting, and burning, coinciding with the rash. The patient was previously admitted with altered mental status and a first-degree AV block, later progressing to a second-degree AV block (Mobitz I). O: Physical examination revealed nonconfluent grouped vesicles on the posterior neck, consistent with herpes zoster. Initial vital signs during a past admission included a blood pressure of 96/58 mm Hg, heart rate of 65 bpm, which later changed to 117/63 mm Hg and 49 bpm, respectively. Laboratory studies noted hypoglycemia at 32. Echocardiography showed preserved left ventricular function at 60% with mild grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. No fever, chills, arthralgias, myalgias, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath were reported. A: Primary diagnosis is herpes zoster reactivation. The patient also has a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, specifically a progression from a first-degree AV block to a second-degree AV block (Mobitz I), with preserved left ventricular function and mild diastolic dysfunction. No acute systemic symptoms were noted. P: Initiate treatment with valacyclovir and oral steroids for herpes zoster. Urgent ophthalmological evaluation is recommended due to the proximity of the rash to the eye. Continuous cardiac monitoring and serial EKGs are advised due to past cardiac issues. An electrophysiology evaluation and outpatient monitoring within two weeks are planned to assess for progression of AV block. Educate the patient on the importance of monitoring symptoms and adhering to follow-up appointments. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've presented your one-year-old son to the emergency department. What seems to be the problem? Patient's Parent: Hi, doctor. My son suddenly has this severe edema on his right eyelid, making it impossible for him to open his right eye. Doctor: I see, let me perform an ophthalmologic examination. It appears that there's painful eyelid edema along with conjunctival chemosis. Due to the extensive eyelid swelling, it's not possible for me to examine his pupillary light reflexes or ocular motility nor perform a fundus examination. Has he had a fever lately? Patient's Parent: Yes, he had a temperature up to 39.1°C. Doctor: Alright. Upon physical examination, your son seems alert and doesn't show any neurological or meningeal signs. However, I notice that he has cutaneous varicella lesions spread over his entire body. Has he received his vaccination for varicella yet? Patient's Parent: No, he hasn't. We were planning to get it between the age of 12 to 15 months. Doctor: I see. His laboratory workup shows normal leukocytes (9.23 x 103/µl), thrombocytopenia with platelets at 67 x 103/µl, and elevated CRP (52 mg/l). The clinical examination can't exclude orbital cellulitis, and there are multiple enlarged lymph nodes in his neck region. We suspect a secondary bacterial infection of the cutaneous varicella lesions around the eyelid. We'll perform a CT of the orbit to investigate further. Patient's Parent: What did the CT scan show, doctor? Doctor: The CT scan revealed pronounced superficial soft tissue inflammation of the right periorbit without evidence of an intraorbital inflammation or abscess formation, cavernous sinus thrombosis, or intracranial extension of the inflammation. Doctor: We'll need to hospitalize your son for a trial of intravenous antiviral (acyclovir) and antibiotic therapy (amikacin, flucloxacillin, and ceftriaxone). We'll monitor his progress and adjust the treatment as needed. Patient's Parent: Okay, thank you. Doctor: After two days, we noticed a poor clinical response to the initial antibiotic therapy, with increasing swelling of his left eyelid as well. So, we changed the antibiotic therapy to clindamycin. Patient's Parent: Is there anything else we need to do for his varicella infection? Doctor: In immunocompetent children, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) usually causes a benign infection without the need for systemic antiviral treatment. However, in this case, we decided to treat the varicella infection with intravenous acyclovir for 5 days (30 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses). Patient's Parent: How are his laboratory markers now? Doctor: His laboratory markers of inflammation have increased, with a maximal leucocytosis of 23.8 x 103/µl and a CRP level. We'll continue to monitor his progress and make any necessary adjustments to his treatment plan. Patient's Parent: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help in treating our son. [/INST] S: The patient, a one-year-old male, presented with severe right eyelid edema, conjunctival chemosis, and inability to open the right eye. The parent reported a recent fever peaking at 39.1°C and noted the presence of cutaneous varicella lesions over the entire body. The child has not yet received the varicella vaccine. O: Physical examination revealed alertness with no neurological or meningeal signs, but multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the neck region were noted. Laboratory findings included normal leukocytes at 9.23 x 10^3/µl, thrombocytopenia with platelets at 67 x 10^3/µl, and elevated CRP at 52 mg/l. CT scan of the orbit showed pronounced superficial soft tissue inflammation of the right periorbit without intraorbital inflammation, abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, or intracranial extension. Initial antibiotic therapy showed poor response, prompting a switch to clindamycin. Laboratory markers later showed increased leucocytosis at 23.8 x 10^3/µl and elevated CRP. A: Primary diagnosis is secondary bacterial infection of cutaneous varicella lesions around the eyelid, with differential diagnoses including orbital cellulitis. The presence of varicella-zoster virus infection complicates the clinical picture. P: The patient was hospitalized for intravenous antiviral therapy with acyclovir (30 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 5 days) and antibiotic therapy including amikacin, flucloxacillin, ceftriaxone, and later clindamycin due to poor initial response. Continuous monitoring of clinical response and laboratory markers is planned, with adjustments to treatment as necessary.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented with dyspnea, headache, and lower extremity edema for the past three weeks. Can you tell me more about these symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble breathing, especially when I'm doing something or moving around. The headaches come and go, and my legs have been swelling up. Doctor: I see. We've done some initial labs, and they show marked leukocytosis with increased myeloid precursors and rare blasts: white blood cell count of 156 k/μL, neutrophils 103 k/μL, monocytes 7.1 k/μL, eosinophils 1.6 k/μL, basophils 0, and blasts 12 k/μL. Other cell lines are normal with hemoglobin of 12.6 gm/dL and platelets of 242 k/μL. Your uric acid was elevated at 9.0 ml/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase was 860 units/L. Patient: Hmm, okay. What does that all mean? Doctor: Based on these results, we performed a bone marrow biopsy, which revealed a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm. The biopsy showed marked hypercellularity (99%) with profound myeloid hyperplasia and complete maturation to segmented neutrophils. Immature myeloid cells of all stages were appropriately present, without dysplasia or increased blasts. A moderate amount of reticulin fibrosis was seen. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: Additionally, Giemsa stain of the aspirate confirmed the biopsy findings with a blast count of less than 5%. By flow cytometric analysis, myeloid cells in the blast gate expressing CD34 accounted for less than 1% of total cells. Molecular diagnostic testing of the aspirate indicated the presence of the BCL-ABL1 p210-type transcript by RT-PCR with an international scale-normalized (ISN) copy number of 35.27%. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing for BCR-ABL1 fusion was present in 89% of cells. Together, these findings are consistent with a diagnosis of chronic phase-CML. Patient: So I have chronic phase-CML? Doctor: Yes, that's correct. Considering your symptoms of intermittent dyspnea in the absence of anemia, we conducted further evaluation. A stress echocardiogram indicated a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Patient: That's good, I guess. Doctor: We also performed a computed tomography (CT) chest with contrast enhancement, which revealed mediastinal, cervical, and supraclavicular adenopathy, without evidence of pulmonary embolism. Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: The next step is for you to undergo an excisional biopsy of the cervical adenopathy to further assess the situation and determine the best course of treatment. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll schedule the biopsy and keep you informed of the results and treatment options. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. Patient: Thanks, I appreciate it.

Uric acid is elevated at 9.0 mg/dL (normal: 3.5-7.2 mg/dL for men, 2.6-6.0 mg/dL for women), and lactate dehydrogenase is 860 units/L (normal: 140-280 units/L). Bone marrow biopsy shows chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm with marked hypercellularity and myeloid hyperplasia. Molecular diagnostics indicate BCL-ABL1 p210-type transcript by RT-PCR with an ISN copy number of 35.27% and BCR-ABL1 fusion in 89% of cells by FISH. Stress echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular ejection fraction. CT chest with contrast reveals mediastinal, cervical, and supraclavicular adenopathy, no pulmonary embolism. A: The primary diagnosis is chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) based on lab findings, molecular diagnostics, and bone marrow biopsy. Differential diagnosis includes other myeloproliferative disorders, but these are less likely given the specific molecular findings. P: Plan to perform an excisional biopsy of the cervical adenopathy to further evaluate the extent of disease and refine treatment options. Initiate treatment for CML, likely including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and monitor response to therapy. Address symptoms of dyspnea, headache, and edema with supportive care as needed. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust as necessary. Educate the patient on the nature of CML, treatment expectations, and importance of adherence to therapy. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing intermittent fever with chills and rigors for about 2 months now. I've also had night sweats, loss of appetite, and loss of weight. Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms during this time? Any rashes or skin changes? Patient: Yes, I had a transient macular rash at the onset of the fever, but it resolved on its own without any treatment. Doctor: Okay, have you experienced any swelling or pain in your lymph nodes? Patient: Yes, I've had generalized lymphadenopathy in my cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions for about a month. They became extremely painful a few days prior to my presentation. Doctor: Have you had any joint pain or swelling? Patient: I've had synovitis in my lower limb small joints, which progressed to lower limb large joints and eventually to my upper limb small and large joints over the last 3 days. Doctor: Do you have any past history or family history of arthritis? Patient: No, I don't have any history of arthritis and my past medical history is unremarkable. Doctor: Can you tell me about your occupation and lifestyle? Have you been exposed to any toxic environmental conditions or engaged in promiscuous sexual behavior? Patient: I work as a mason, but I haven't been exposed to any toxic conditions that I know of. I don't have any promiscuous sexual behavior, I don't consume alcohol, and I don't smoke tobacco. Doctor: Thank you for the information. On examination, you appear emaciated, febrile, and pale. I can feel bilateral, firm, matted lymph nodes of varying sizes, about 2-3 cm, in your cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions, which are tender. There's also tender hepatosplenomegaly. We'll need to run some tests to better understand what's going on. (After running the tests) Doctor: Your laboratory investigations show high white cell counts with normocytic anemia. Your platelets are within the normal range. Your inflammatory markers are high and have been in a rising trend since the onset of arthritis. Your liver and renal functions are normal. Your rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, anti-nuclear antibodies, HIV 1 and 2 antibodies, Epstein-Barr virus IgG, and immunoglobulin G tests are all negative. Patient: So, what does this mean, doctor? Doctor: Based on your symptoms and test results, we need to consider several possible causes for your condition. We'll continue monitoring your condition and may need to run additional tests to determine the best course of treatment. In the meantime, it's important to rest and maintain a healthy diet to help your body recover. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll be in touch soon with further instructions. Take care. [/INST] S: The patient, a mason, presents with a 2-month history of intermittent fever, chills, rigors, night sweats, loss of appetite, and weight loss. He reports a transient macular rash at the onset of the fever and generalized painful lymphadenopathy in cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions for about a month. He also describes progressive synovitis affecting both small and large joints of the lower and upper limbs over the last 3 days. The patient denies any past or family history of arthritis, exposure to toxic environmental conditions, promiscuous sexual behavior, alcohol consumption, or tobacco use. O: Physical examination reveals an emaciated, febrile, and pale patient. Palpation identifies bilateral, firm, matted lymph nodes of 2-3 cm in cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions, tender to touch, and tender hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory investigations show high white cell counts, normocytic anemia, normal platelet count, elevated inflammatory markers, and normal liver and renal functions. Tests for rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, anti-nuclear antibodies, HIV 1 and 2 antibodies, Epstein-Barr virus IgG, and immunoglobulin G are negative. A: The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a systemic inflammatory process possibly due to an infectious or autoimmune etiology, given the exclusion of common rheumatologic and viral causes. Differential diagnoses include atypical infections, lymphoproliferative disorders, or other systemic inflammatory disorders. P: Plan to continue monitoring the patient's condition with additional diagnostic tests to further narrow down the causes. Recommend rest and a healthy diet to support recovery. Schedule a follow-up appointment for review of additional test results and adjustment of the treatment plan as necessary. Educate the patient on the importance of adhering to the management plan and maintaining regular follow-up appointments. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've been referred to the Medical Genetic Centre of Guangdong Women and Children Hospital for prenatal diagnosis due to imbalanced development of your twins. Can you tell me more about your pregnancy and medical history? Patient: Yeah, I'm 26 years old, and this is my first pregnancy. I got pregnant naturally, and I have no family history of twins or multiple births. There haven't been any remarkable abnormalities in my medical history. Doctor: Thank you for the information. We performed some fetal ultrasound scans on your pregnancy. The scans showed a monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy with imbalanced development of the twins. Twin 1 presented with normal development of the brain, abdomen, skeleton, and cardiovascular system. Twin 2 had a normal brain and abdomen, but there were some issues like an underdeveloped or absent radius, a ventricular septal defect, and a cleft lip and palate. Patient: Oh, that's concerning. What about the ultrasound parameters for both twins? Doctor: For Twin 1, the Biparietal diameter (BPD) was 59 mm, Head circumference (HC) was 223 mm, Abdominal circumference (AC) was 198 mm, Femur length (FL) was 45 mm, and Heart rate (HR) was 154/min. For Twin 2, the BPD was 51 mm, HC was 192 mm, AC was 141 mm, FL was 35 mm, and HR was 141/min. Patient: I see. What do you think could be the cause of the imbalanced development? Doctor: The data from the ultrasound examination indicated that the imbalanced development of the two fetuses might be due to Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), but we can't exclude the possibility of chromosomal abnormalities. Patient: What are the next steps then? Doctor: After discussing with our genetic counseling team, we recommend that you and your partner consider a diagnostic amniocentesis for the normal fetus, Twin 1. This will help us determine if there are any chromosomal abnormalities. Patient: Okay, we agreed to do the amniocentesis. What will be done with the amniotic cells? Doctor: The amniotic cells will be cultured in CHANG Medium for 7-10 days for karyotyping and Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) analysis. Conventional G-banded karyotyping will be performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes and cord blood according to standard protocols. We will use Agilent's commercial arrays for the aCGH analysis and the data will be analyzed with AgilentGen. Patient: Thank you for explaining everything. We'll follow your recommendations and hope for the best outcome for our twins. Doctor: You're welcome. We will keep you updated on the results and guide you through the next steps based on the findings. Take care, and don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. [/INST] S: The patient, a 26-year-old female in her first pregnancy, reports no significant personal or family medical history, including no history of twins or multiple births. She presents for prenatal diagnosis due to imbalanced development of monochorionic diamniotic twins, identified during routine fetal ultrasound. O: Fetal ultrasound shows Twin 1 with normal development (BPD 59 mm, HC 223 mm, AC 198 mm, FL 45 mm, HR 154/min) and Twin 2 with several abnormalities including an underdeveloped or absent radius, ventricular septal defect, and cleft lip and palate (BPD 51 mm, HC 192 mm, AC 141 mm, FL 35 mm, HR 141/min). The imbalanced development raises concerns for Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and potential chromosomal abnormalities. A: Primary assessment suggests a monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy with significant developmental imbalance possibly due to TTTS, though chromosomal abnormalities cannot be excluded. Differential diagnosis includes genetic syndromes that could explain the physical anomalies in Twin 2. P: Plan includes performing diagnostic amniocentesis on Twin 1 to check for chromosomal abnormalities using CHANG Medium culture, karyotyping, and aCGH analysis. Results will guide further management. The patient and her partner have consented to this procedure. Continuous monitoring of the pregnancy and fetal development will be necessary, with further genetic counseling based on amniocentesis results. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you're on a regimen of steroids for either Behçet's disease or systemic lupus erythematosus. What brings you in today? Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really unwell lately. I've had a fever, cough, and my breathing has been getting worse over the past week. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any other medical history I should be aware of? Patient: I had a small bowel resection for intestinal necrosis a while back and have been on parenteral nutrition since then. Doctor: Thank you for that information. Let's check your vitals. Hmm, you're presenting with a fever of 39.1°C, tachycardia of 116/min, and hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 94% in a nasal oxygen cannula. I also hear a grade 3/6 regurgitant diastolic murmur in your left third intercostal space during auscultation.  Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Unfortunately, you've fallen into respiratory failure. We'll need to support you with mechanical ventilation immediately. Your PaO2/FiO2 ratio is calculated as 105, which is quite low. We've also done chest radiography and computed tomography, which revealed diffuse extensive consolidation in both lung fields, corresponding with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Patient: So what does that mean? Doctor: The diagnosis was confirmed by bronchoalveolar lavage, which showed increasing bloody secretions in three consecutive aliquots. Additionally, a peripheral blood examination revealed a white blood cell count of 11,540/mm3, hemoglobin of 6.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 132,000/mm3. Your aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were 18, 16, and 164 IU/L, respectively. Patient: Are my kidneys okay? Doctor: Your renal function is slightly affected, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL. Your C-reactive protein is elevated to 12.3 mg/dL. Blood cultures afterward grew Staphylococcus warneri. Patient: What does the echocardiography show? Doctor: Echocardiography revealed aortic regurgitation and a mobile vegetation measuring 15 × 9 mm on the commissure between the left and right coronary cusps. Your left ventricular function is preserved, with an ejection fraction of 62%. Patient: So what's the diagnosis? Doctor: You've been diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis, which is complicated by respiratory distress related to the DAH. Patient: Can I have surgery to fix this? Doctor: At this point, you're judged not to tolerate cardiac surgery due to the exacerbating bleeding and respiratory failure related to heparinized extracorporeal circulation. We'll need to come up with a different management plan. Patient: What's the plan then? Doctor: We will discuss the best course of action with your medical team and inform you and your family of the decisions made. Your treatment and recovery are our top priority. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient reports feeling unwell with symptoms of fever, cough, and worsening breathing over the past week. The patient has a history of a small bowel resection for intestinal necrosis and is currently on parenteral nutrition. The patient is also on a regimen of steroids for either Behçet's disease or systemic lupus erythematosus. O: Vital signs include a fever of 39.1°C, tachycardia at 116/min, and hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals a grade 3/6 regurgitant diastolic murmur in the left third intercostal space. Laboratory findings show a white blood cell count of 11,540/mm3, hemoglobin of 6.6 g/dL, platelet count of 132,000/mm3, AST 18 IU/L, ALT 16 IU/L, LDH 164 IU/L, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, and CRP 12.3 mg/dL. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus warneri. Imaging includes chest radiography and CT showing diffuse extensive consolidation in both lung fields, indicative of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Echocardiography revealed aortic regurgitation and a mobile vegetation measuring 15 × 9 mm on the commissure between the left and right coronary cusps, with preserved left ventricular function (EF 62%). A: The primary diagnosis is bacterial endocarditis complicated by respiratory distress related to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Differential diagnoses include exacerbations of underlying autoimmune disorders such as Behçet's disease or systemic lupus erythematosus. The patient's condition is further complicated by previous intestinal surgery and dependency on parenteral nutrition. P: Immediate management includes supportive care with mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Antibiotic therapy tailored to culture results (Staphylococcus warneri) is necessary. Cardiac surgery is currently contraindicated due to high risks associated with the patient's current unstable condition. Continuous monitoring of cardiac and respiratory status is essential, and adjustments to the treatment plan will be discussed with the medical team and communicated to the patient and family. Further consultations with cardiology, infectious disease specialists, and a nutritionist are planned to address the complex needs of the patient. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Patient: Hi doctor, I came to the emergency room because my leg pain has been getting worse. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history? Patient: Well, I have peripheral artery disease and iron deficiency anemia. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Let's first check your hemoglobin level. I'll order some initial laboratory tests. Patient: Okay. Doctor: Your hemoglobin level came back unexpectedly low at 5.4 g/dl. We gave you three units of packed red blood cells, and your hemoglobin level increased to 6.9 g/dl. I'm going to consult our gastroenterology department for an evaluation of possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Patient: I see. But I haven't noticed any hematochezia, melena, hematemesis, fatigue, or abdominal pain. Doctor: That's good to know. Have you been taking any iron supplementation? Patient: Yes, I've been taking oral iron supplements for the last five years. Doctor: And have you had any previous upper and lower endoscopies? Patient: Yes, I've had both, and they were negative. Doctor: Thank you. On physical examination, I noticed you have pale conjunctivae. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender, and there are no masses, organomegaly, or vascular bruits detected. Your vital signs are stable, and your laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 6.9 g/dL, a mean corpuscular volume of 73.5, and a hematocrit level of 22.7% with normal white blood cell and platelet counts. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: Your iron-deficiency anemia analysis shows ferritin levels of 6 ng/mL, serum iron levels of 25 μg/dL, total iron-binding capacity of 535 μg/dL, and transferrin saturation of 5%. We performed an upper and lower endoscopy, which showed no active bleeding or suspicious lesions. Patient: That's a relief. Doctor: We then performed a small bowel capsule endoscopy and found a suspicious lesion in your jejunum with evidence of fresh blood. To investigate further, we did a double balloon enteroscopy and discovered a 25mm proximal jejunal soft submucosal mass with mild superficial ulceration/erosions of the surface mucosa. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We took biopsy samples from the mass and will refer you for further management and surgical evaluation. The final pathology results revealed a cavernous hemangioma without any evidence of malignancy. Patient: That's good to hear. Thank you, doctor, for taking care of me. Doctor: You're welcome. Keep an eye on your symptoms and follow up with your surgeon for further guidance on managing the hemangioma. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of peripheral artery disease and iron deficiency anemia, presented to the emergency room complaining of worsening leg pain. The patient has been on oral iron supplements for five years and has had no recent symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding such as hematochezia, melena, hematemesis, fatigue, or abdominal pain. Previous upper and lower endoscopies were negative. O: Initial hemoglobin was critically low at 5.4 g/dl, prompting transfusion of three units of packed red blood cells, raising the level to 6.9 g/dl. Physical examination revealed pale conjunctivae, a soft and non-tender abdomen with no masses, organomegaly, or vascular bruits. Vital signs were stable. Laboratory results showed a mean corpuscular volume of 73.5, hematocrit of 22.7%, with normal white blood cell and platelet counts. Iron studies indicated severe iron deficiency with ferritin at 6 ng/mL, serum iron at 25 μg/dL, total iron-binding capacity at 535 μg/dL, and transferrin saturation at 5%. Capsule endoscopy identified a suspicious lesion in the jejunum, confirmed by double balloon enteroscopy as a 25mm jejunal soft submucosal mass with superficial ulceration. Biopsy confirmed a cavernous hemangioma. A: The primary diagnosis is severe iron deficiency anemia secondary to bleeding from a jejunal cavernous hemangioma. Differential diagnosis initially included gastrointestinal bleeding from other sources, but investigations have ruled out other common etiologies. P: The patient received an initial transfusion and stabilization of hemoglobin levels. Gastroenterology consultation led to the identification and biopsy of the jejunal lesion. The patient will be referred for surgical evaluation and management of the cavernous hemangioma. Continued iron supplementation is recommended, along with close monitoring of hemoglobin and iron levels. Follow-up with a surgeon is necessary to discuss potential surgical removal of the hemangioma and to prevent further complications from bleeding. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you've been referred to our institution for suspected right lung cancer. You have a history of angina, diabetes, hypertension, and Alzheimer's disease, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: During your physical examination, we noted your body height is 150 cm, weight is 68.4 kg, and body mass index is 30.4. We performed a chest computed tomography (CT) which revealed a 1.8 cm nodular lesion with an ill-defined margin in the right lower lobe. This suggests lung cancer without metastasis. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We also conducted a three-dimensional CT which showed normal bronchial anatomy. Your preoperative vital capacity was 1.77 L, and the forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 1.35 L. We then performed a thoracoscopic right lower lobectomy without mediastinal lymph node dissection. Patient: How did that go? Doctor: The anesthetic and operative times were 189 and 92 minutes, respectively, and there was minimal blood loss. We provided 1000 mL of intraoperative fluid replacement during the surgery. The final pathological finding was adenocarcinoma with hilar lymph node metastasis, diagnosed as pT1bN1M0, which is p-stage IIB according to the 8th IASLC classification criteria. Patient: I see. Doctor: Extubation was safely performed in the operating room, and you were then followed up in the intensive care unit. However, postoperatively, you complained of dyspnea without chest pain and developed arterial oxygen desaturation 12 hours after the surgery. Patient: Yes, I remember having trouble breathing. Doctor: Your oxygen saturation reduced to 86% despite the administration of 10 L/min oxygen, corresponding to a PaO2 of 54 mmHg. We conducted an emergency chest CT which revealed right upper bronchial stenosis with hilar peribronchovascular soft tissue edema (PSTE). The middle lung lobe was pushed upward and forward, causing the right upper lung lobe to twist dorsally. A three-dimensional CT scan showed severe bronchial stenosis. Patient: That sounds serious. Doctor: We performed an emergency bronchoscopy which revealed severe right upper bronchial stenosis with an eccentric rotation and severe edema. Echocardiography and electrocardiography were also conducted, showing a cardiac ejection fraction of 55% and a normal diameter of the inferior vena cava. This ruled out ischemic heart disease. Patient: So, what's next? Doctor: We'll continue to monitor your condition and perform additional tests if necessary. Please let us know if you experience any further symptoms or discomfort. We'll do our best to ensure your recovery and manage your other health conditions, such as angina, diabetes, hypertension, and Alzheimer's disease. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello KA, I see you're a 50-year-old premenopausal parous female. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi doctor, I initially presented for imaging when I was 45 years old because I had a right breast lump for about 6 months. I don't have any positive family history of breast cancer. Doctor: I see. Let me check your records. It looks like you had a right sonomammography performed at the Radiology Department, UCH, using a Logiq P5 GE ultrasound machine with a high frequency linear transducer. At your first presentation, they found a poorly circumscribed mixed echogenic mass at the 12 o'clock position, measuring 4.9 × 3.2 cm. The mass had specks of calcifications within it and Doppler interrogation showed evidence of increased vascularity. They assigned a final BI-RADS category of 4, which is suspicious for malignancy. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: After that, conventional mammography was performed and confirmed a poorly defined mass with microcalcifications and architectural distortion at the 12 o'clock position. The left breast at that time was normal. Then, you had an ultrasound-guided CNB of the right breast lump, and the histopathological report confirmed IDC. The immunochemistry report was triple-negative. Do I have that correct? Patient: Yes, exactly. Doctor: Following the diagnosis, you immediately commenced neoadjuvant chemotherapy and later had modified right radical mastectomy. After surgery, you had adjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy. You were a compliant patient and had remission for approximately 5 years, during which you were off chemotherapeutic drugs. Is that accurate? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Now, I understand you developed a painless progressive lump in the contralateral breast 5 years later and presented to the surgical outpatient clinic. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Sure, I noticed a palpable left breast mass with associated bloody nipple discharge. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Upon examination, the left breast mass and bloody nipple discharge were confirmed on sonomammography. The histological examination of the ultrasound-guided CNB specimen of the contralateral mass confirmed it to be an IDC. You then had modified left radical mastectomy after adjuvant chemotherapy. Currently, you are on paclitaxel and radiotherapy. Is that all correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Alright, it's important to continue your current treatment and follow-up appointments as scheduled. We will closely monitor your condition and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. If you notice any new symptoms, please contact us immediately. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.

She now presents with a new, painless, progressive left breast mass and associated bloody nipple discharge, diagnosed as IDC. O: Initial right breast sonomammography revealed a poorly circumscribed mixed echogenic mass with calcifications and increased vascularity, BI-RADS category 4. Histopathology confirmed triple-negative IDC. Current examination confirmed similar findings in the left breast, with sonomammography showing a mass and bloody nipple discharge. Histopathology of the left breast confirmed IDC. The patient is currently undergoing paclitaxel treatment and radiotherapy. A: Primary diagnosis is recurrent invasive ductal carcinoma, now in the contralateral breast, initially presenting as triple-negative on the right side and currently treated on the left side. The patient has a history of compliance with treatment protocols and has previously achieved remission. P: Continue current regimen of paclitaxel and radiotherapy for the left breast IDC. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment response and adjust therapy as needed. Educate the patient on signs of potential complications or recurrence and encourage immediate reporting of new symptoms. Ensure psychological support and counseling are available to address emotional and mental health needs during ongoing cancer treatment. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you've been referred to our Ophthalmology department due to photophobia and redness in both eyes that started a week ago. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've been experiencing discomfort in both of my eyes, even though I have 20/20 vision. The light sensitivity has been bothering me a lot, and my eyes look really red. Doctor: Hmm, let's perform a Slit-lamp examination to take a closer look at your eyes. *After the examination* It appears you have bilateral conjunctival injection and an anterior chamber reaction, which is graded as +4. There are also some fine, non-granulomatous bilateral keratic precipitates. Patient: What does that mean, exactly? Doctor: These findings suggest that there's inflammation in your eyes. Additionally, we performed a Dilated fundus examination, which demonstrated normal retinal findings and no signs of retinitis. OCT, enhanced depth imaging-OCT, and FAF were all normal as well. Patient: I've also been having some redness and pain in my right ear. What could be causing that? Doctor: Upon physical examination, it seems you have cartilaginous inflammation in your right ear. I'm going to refer you to the rheumatology department for further systemic evaluation. *After the evaluation* Doctor: So, your hematological examination showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level (69 mm/hr and 126 mg/L, respectively). However, your Complete blood count and other biochemical parameters were within normal ranges, as were your infective and inflammatory markers, such as anti-DNA, ANA, C3 and C4 immunoglobulins, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, anti-SM, anti-SCL, and anti-JO. Patient: What does this mean for my treatment? Doctor: We'll treat your eye inflammation with topical dexamethasone 0.1 mg/5 mL ophthalmic solution hourly, cyclopentolate 1% 3 times a day, and systemic oral 1 mg/kg/day prednisolone therapy with a plan to taper. *After one month of treatment* Doctor: It appears that the combination of topical and oral steroid therapy has been effective. Your best corrected visual acuity remains stable, and the visual deterioration has resolved. Patient: That's great news! So, how do my eyes look now? Doctor: Slit-lamp biomicroscopy reveals a dramatic regression in the anterior chamber reaction. There are only trace anterior chamber cells/flare and few keratic precipitates remaining. Patient: What's the plan moving forward? Doctor: Your treatment will continue with slow tapering of the medications. We'll keep monitoring your progress to ensure that your symptoms continue to improve. [/INST] S: The patient reports photophobia and redness in both eyes that began a week ago, accompanied by discomfort despite having 20/20 vision. The patient also mentions redness and pain in the right ear. O: Slit-lamp examination revealed bilateral conjunctival injection, a +4 anterior chamber reaction, and fine, non-granulomatous bilateral keratic precipitates. Dilated fundus examination showed normal retinal findings. OCT, enhanced depth imaging-OCT, and FAF were normal. Physical examination of the ear indicated cartilaginous inflammation. Hematological examination showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (69 mm/hr) and C-reactive protein (126 mg/L), with other parameters within normal limits. Best corrected visual acuity is stable, and recent slit-lamp biomicroscopy showed reduced anterior chamber reaction and fewer keratic precipitates. A: The primary diagnosis is bilateral anterior uveitis with associated systemic inflammation, evidenced by elevated inflammatory markers and ear cartilage inflammation. Differential diagnosis could include autoimmune disorders, but specific autoimmune markers were normal. P: Initiated treatment with topical dexamethasone 0.1 mg/5 mL ophthalmic solution hourly and cyclopentolate 1% three times a day, along with systemic oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day, with plans to taper based on response. After one month, significant improvement was noted, and the plan is to continue medication with slow tapering and regular monitoring of symptoms and inflammation. Referral to rheumatology for further systemic evaluation was made due to ear symptoms and elevated inflammatory markers. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've come to the emergency department because I've been experiencing atraumatic pain in my neck and shoulders, along with a fever for the last 4 weeks. Doctor: I see. Can you please tell me a bit about your medical history? Patient: Sure. I have arterial hypertension and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition (CPDD) disease, which I manage with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. I don't have any medical family history, and I've never had any surgical interventions. Oh, and about 6 months ago, I had infective endocarditis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), but that was successfully treated with medical treatment. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. How was the infective endocarditis diagnosed? Patient: It was diagnosed by suggestive findings on a transesophageal echocardiogram and isolation of MRSA on two consecutive blood cultures. Doctor: I understand. Did you require any operative treatment for your infective endocarditis? Patient: No, because I had moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation, the cardiothoracic surgery team said that no operative treatment was necessary. Doctor: What was the medical treatment you received for the infective endocarditis? Patient: I was given intravenously administered antibiotics using a combination of vancomycin at 30 mg/kg per day for 8 weeks and gentamicin at 3 mg/kg per day for 5 days. Doctor: Thank you. And how did you respond to the treatment? Patient: I became afebrile from the third week of antibiotherapy, and my C-reactive protein (CRP) was negative at the last week of antibiotherapy. Doctor: That's good to hear. Now, at the current presentation, I noticed during the physical examination that you have a painful and tender swelling over your right sternoclavicular joint (SCJ), and the overlying skin is stretched and shiny. Your rectal temperature is 39 °C, and there's a moderate decrease in your right shoulder's range of motion. Your cardiac auscultation doesn't reveal any added sounds or abnormalities. We also conducted laboratory investigations that showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 107 mm at the end of 1 hour, and a CRP at 222 mg/l. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We also performed computed tomography (CT) scans that revealed destruction of the medial extremities of your two clavicles and bilateral collections in the soft tissues around the SCJs. Magnetic resonance imaging will be necessary for further evaluation. Patient: What should I do now, doctor? Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and discuss the appropriate course of action based on the results of the magnetic resonance imaging. Please follow up with us regularly and let us know if your symptoms worsen or if you experience any new symptoms. Patient: Okay, thank you for helping me, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. [/INST] S: The patient, a known case of arterial hypertension and CPDD, presents with a 4-week history of atraumatic neck and shoulder pain accompanied by fever. The patient has a past medical history of infective endocarditis due to MRSA, treated with intravenous antibiotics, and reports no surgical history. No family medical history was noted. O: Physical examination revealed painful, tender swelling over the right SCJ with shiny, stretched skin, and decreased range of motion in the right shoulder. The patient's rectal temperature was 39 °C. Cardiac auscultation was normal. Lab findings showed an ESR of 107 mm/hr and a CRP of 222 mg/l. CT scans indicated destruction of the medial extremities of both clavicles and bilateral soft tissue collections around the SCJs. A: The primary assessment suggests a possible infectious or inflammatory process involving the sternoclavicular joints, potentially a recurrence or complication of previous infective endocarditis, given the patient's history and current imaging findings. Differential diagnoses could include septic arthritis or another form of joint infection. P: Plan to monitor the patient's condition closely with regular follow-ups. Initiate further diagnostic evaluation with MRI to better assess the extent of joint and soft tissue involvement. Based on MRI results, consider starting empiric antibiotic therapy while awaiting culture or further diagnostic results. Educate the patient on the importance of reporting any new symptoms or worsening of the current condition. Discuss potential need for consultation with infectious diseases or rheumatology depending on MRI outcomes and culture results. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been having this mass in my anterior abdominal wall for about a year now, and it's been growing progressively. Doctor: I see. Let me perform a physical examination to assess the situation. Alright, I can feel a 7 x 6 cm firm irregular subcutaneous mass in the right lower para-umbilical area of your anterior abdominal wall. Your vital signs are normal, and on palpation, your abdomen is soft and lax with no intra-abdominal masses. There are no palpable lymph nodes, and your cardiac and respiratory examinations are unremarkable. We'll need to perform a Computerized Tomography (CT) scan to get a better understanding of the mass. Patient: Okay, thank you. [After CT scan] Doctor: The CT scan has revealed a mass within your abdominal wall. Your laboratory investigations are within normal limits, and your chest X-ray is unremarkable. We'll have to perform a wide local excision with safety margins to remove the tumor. Patient: Alright, if that's what's needed. [After surgery] Doctor: The surgery went well, and the postoperative period was uneventful. You'll be discharged on the second postoperative day in a satisfactory condition. Patient: That's great to hear. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. Upon examining the excised specimen, we found an ellipse of skin measuring 13 x 10 cm with subcutaneous fatty tissue measuring 11 cm in thickness. The cut section revealed a well-defined nonencapsulated grayish-yellow mass measuring 7 x 6 cm with foci of necrosis. No skin infiltration or abdominal skeletal muscle involvement was noted. Patient: Hmm, what does the microscopic examination show? Doctor: The microscopic examination revealed a well-defined but nonencapsulated subcutaneous mesenchymal neoplasm composed of irregular islands of large cells. These cells have mostly round to oval pleomorphic vesicular nuclei, with markedly granular cytoplasm and several large eosinophilic globules. The nuclear cytoplasmic ratio was variable, with several cells having large nuclei. The tumor nests were surrounded by bands of fibrous connective tissue. Patient: Were there any signs of tumor necrosis? Doctor: Yes, there were many foci of tumor necrosis and scattered mitotic figures, 4 per 10 HPF at a magnification of 200. The margins of resection were free of the tumor. Patient: What about the Immunohistochemical stains? Doctor: The Immunohistochemical stains showed that the tumor cells were strongly positive for vimentin, S100, and CD68. Stains for cytokeratin (CK), smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, and myogenin were negative, which gives us more information about the tumor's nature. Patient: Alright, thank you so much for all your help, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome! Please follow up with me as needed, and take care. [/INST] S: The patient reported a progressively growing mass in the anterior abdominal wall, present for about a year. The mass is located in the right lower para-umbilical area. The patient has no other symptoms mentioned. O: Physical examination revealed a 7 x 6 cm firm, irregular subcutaneous mass in the right lower para-umbilical area. Vital signs were normal. Abdominal palpation showed a soft and lax abdomen with no intra-abdominal masses or palpable lymph nodes. Cardiac and respiratory examinations were unremarkable. CT scan confirmed the presence of the mass within the abdominal wall. Laboratory investigations and chest X-ray were within normal limits. Postoperative findings included an excised specimen of skin and subcutaneous tissue with a well-defined, nonencapsulated grayish-yellow mass measuring 7 x 6 cm, showing foci of necrosis but no skin infiltration or muscle involvement. Microscopic examination revealed a subcutaneous mesenchymal neoplasm with pleomorphic nuclei and variable nuclear cytoplasmic ratio. Immunohistochemical stains were positive for vimentin, S100, and CD68, and negative for CK, SMA, desmin, and myogenin. A: The primary diagnosis is a subcutaneous mesenchymal neoplasm, likely benign given the well-defined nature and absence of infiltration into surrounding structures. Differential diagnoses could include other soft tissue tumors, but the immunohistochemical profile supports a specific mesenchymal origin. The prognosis appears favorable as the surgical margins were clear and there was no evidence of aggressive features such as deep infiltration or distant metastasis. P: The patient underwent successful wide local excision with clear margins. Postoperative management included routine care and monitoring for signs of infection or recurrence. The patient was discharged on the second postoperative day in satisfactory condition. Follow-up appointments will be necessary to monitor for recurrence or any late complications. Further education on signs of recurrence and when to seek medical attention was provided. No additional treatment is currently required, but regular follow-ups are essential for early detection of any changes. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I've reviewed your past history and you mentioned that you had a cholecystectomy before. Can you tell me more about the pain you're experiencing? Patient: Sure, it's a vague colicky epigastric pain that started about 2 years ago. The pain had some fluctuation during this time, but it became more severe and constant, with the peak being about 4 months ago. Doctor: Hmm, I see. Did you notice any relationship between the pain and consuming food, especially high-fat meals? Patient: No, there's no relationship between food and the pain severity. In the beginning, anti-acids would help, but eventually, none of the medications I took could make me free of pain. Doctor: I understand. Did you have any other symptoms like urticarial reaction, jaundice, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, or pruritus during these two years? Patient: No, but I did have occasional fever without any specific pattern, and I experienced chills too. Doctor: What about your appetite? Did you have anorexia or any changes in your eating habits? Patient: Actually, I didn't have anorexia, I had an increased appetite instead. Doctor: Alright. Did you experience any other symptoms like constipation or malaise? Patient: Yes, constipation was a major symptom, and I felt malaise as well. Doctor: Have you lost any weight during this time? Patient: Yes, I lost about 10 kg in the last 2 months of this disease. Doctor: Thank you for providing this information. I understand that you've agreed to be presented in a report about your case. Can you tell me more about your lifestyle, especially in the past few years? Patient: Well, I used to be a farmer and husband-man, but about 3 years ago, I became a trucker, traveling around the country and sometimes taking unsafe and insanitary food and water. I don't use drugs, alcohol, or opium, but I do smoke cigarettes. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. During your physical examination, you were afebrile and moderately ill, with stable vital signs and normal sclera without icterus. There were no signs of rash or excoriation, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, gynecomastia, or abdominal distention. Your cardiovascular and lung examination also showed no abnormalities. However, there was tenderness in your right upper quadrant during abdominal palpation. Patient: Okay, so what's the next step? Doctor: Based on your symptoms and history, we will need to run further tests to determine the cause of your pain and other symptoms. Once we have a clearer understanding of the issue, we can discuss appropriate treatment options. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: Patient reports a history of vague, colicky epigastric pain starting 2 years ago, worsening over time with peak severity 4 months ago. Pain is not related to food intake. Initial relief with antacids was noted, but effectiveness diminished over time. Accompanying symptoms include occasional fever, chills, constipation, malaise, and significant weight loss of 10 kg in the last 2 months. No urticarial reaction, jaundice, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, or pruritus reported. Patient has an increased appetite and a history of cholecystectomy. Lifestyle changes include a transition from farming to truck driving, with exposure to potentially unsafe food and water. Patient smokes cigarettes but denies use of drugs, alcohol, or opium. O: Physical examination shows the patient to be afebrile and moderately ill with stable vital signs. No icterus, rash, excoriation, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, gynecomastia, or abdominal distention observed. Cardiovascular and lung examinations are normal. Notable findings include tenderness in the right upper quadrant upon abdominal palpation. A: Differential diagnosis includes chronic gastrointestinal disorder potentially linked to post-cholecystectomy changes or other gastrointestinal pathologies such as peptic ulcer disease, chronic pancreatitis, or a malignancy given the weight loss and persistent symptoms. The lack of specific pattern in fever and systemic symptoms raises concerns for a possible infectious or inflammatory condition. P: Plan to conduct further diagnostic tests including complete blood count, liver function tests, abdominal ultrasound, and possibly a CT scan to evaluate the cause of the epigastric pain and other symptoms. Referral to a gastroenterologist for specialized assessment may be necessary based on test results. Patient education on smoking cessation and safe dietary practices during travel will be provided. Follow-up appointment to review test results and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 46-year-old male patient with a background of HHT and aortic valve replacement due to aortic insufficiency. Can you tell me if you've had any psychiatric treatment, consumed antipsychotic drugs, had recent molar extractions, or have a background of TMJ dislocation? Patient: No, I haven't had any psychiatric treatment, taken antipsychotic drugs, had molar extractions, or have any history of TMJ dislocation. Doctor: Okay, thank you for the information. I understand that you had a lung transplant recently and on the fifth day after the transplant, you began experiencing symptoms in the intensive therapy unit. Can you describe those symptoms for me? Patient: Yes, I started feeling mandibular pain, trismus, and some weird movements in my jaw, like oromandibular dystonia. Doctor: Thank you for describing those symptoms. During the physical exam, we found that you presented bilateral jaw subluxation with reuptake inhibition of the articular condyle-disc complex, contraction at the masticatory muscles level, fascies dolorosa, dystonia of the facial third with articular blocking, incapacity for buccal closure or lateral excursion, and slight dysphagia. As part of your hospitalization background, you received 2.5 mg of haloperidol and 0.25 mg of risperidone (two doses) due to hyperactive delirium an hour before the event.  Patient: Oh, I see. What did you do next? Doctor: We decided to take a computed tomography (CT) of your craniofacial complex and brain without IV contrast, and we found dislocation of both mandibular condyles with anterior position to the temporal's glenoid cavity. Fortunately, there was no evidence of associated bone injuries. Patient: That's a relief. So, what was the treatment for my condition? Doctor: We provided analgesia and muscular relaxation to make you more comfortable. Then, we performed the Nelaton reduction maneuver and placed Barton bandaging using an antiseptic. We checked the clinical and radiological reduction through another CT scan, which showed a normal condylar position. Patient: And did that help with my symptoms? Doctor: Yes, it did. You progressed without further subluxations during your hospitalization. Patient: That's great to hear. Is there anything else I need to do or be aware of moving forward? Doctor: Just continue to monitor your symptoms and report any changes or concerns to your healthcare team. Otherwise, you should be able to continue with your recovery. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care and have a smooth recovery.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you were admitted to Shiga University of Medical Science Hospital. What brings you here today? Patient: Hi, doc. I've been experiencing abdominal pain and frequent episodes of watery diarrhea for the past 2 months. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history? Patient: Yeah, I had a gastric ulcer about 40 years ago, and I also have hypertension and have undergone chemotherapy for multiple myeloma. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. What medications are you currently taking? Patient: I'm taking aspirin, prednisolone, melphalan, and lansoprazole. Doctor: Okay, let's check your temperature. It's within the normal range. Now, let me do a physical examination. Hmm, I notice acute left abdominal pain and muscular defense. We'll need to run some tests. [After running laboratory tests] Doctor: Your laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 2100/μl, which is below the normal range of 3000–8000/μl. Your C-reactive protein (CRP) level is 0.19 mg/dl, which is within the normal range of less than 0.30 mg/dl. We also performed a computed tomography (CT) scan. Patient: What did the CT scan show? Doctor: The CT scan showed a thickened bowel wall with edema involving free air around the colonic splenic flexure, and ascites on the liver surface (Fig. a, b). Based on these findings, you have been diagnosed with peritonitis and colonic perforation. Patient: Oh no, what do we do now? Doctor: We will need to perform an emergency laparotomy. During the procedure, we found that the ascites contained intestinal fluid. The colon around the splenic angle was necrotic and edematous, so we performed a left hemicolectomy. Patient: What were the findings after the surgery? Doctor: Macroscopic findings showed edematous mucosa and tortuous longitudinal ulcers. Histopathological examination revealed typical findings of collagenous colitis, with a thick subepithelial collagenous band and deep ulcers with perforation. Active lymphocyte infiltration was observed in all layers of the colon. Fortunately, there was no evidence of acute ischemic colitis or inflammatory bowel disease. Patient: So, what happens now? Doctor: Your postoperative course was uneventful, and you were discharged on the 28th postoperative day. We suspect that your condition may be related to the lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), that you have been taking. We will change your PPI from lansoprazole to rabeprazole. Patient: Will that help with my symptoms? Doctor: Yes, after changing the PPI, you should notice an improvement in your diarrhea symptoms. Please keep us updated on your progress and let us know if you have any further concerns. [/INST] S: The patient, a long-term survivor of multiple myeloma and hypertension, presented with a 2-month history of abdominal pain and frequent episodes of watery diarrhea. He has a past medical history of a gastric ulcer and is currently on aspirin, prednisolone, melphalan, and lansoprazole. O: Physical examination revealed acute left abdominal pain with muscular defense. Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count of 2100/μl (normal: 3000–8000/μl) and a CRP level of 0.19 mg/dl (normal: <0.30 mg/dl). CT imaging indicated a thickened bowel wall with edema, free air around the colonic splenic flexure, and ascites on the liver surface. Emergency laparotomy and left hemicolectomy were performed, revealing necrotic and edematous colon with collagenous colitis on histopathology. A: The primary diagnosis is collagenous colitis with complications including peritonitis and colonic perforation. The patient's symptoms and surgical findings suggest a possible adverse reaction to lansoprazole. P: Postoperatively, the patient was switched from lansoprazole to rabeprazole to potentially mitigate the adverse effects associated with the former. The patient was advised to monitor and report any persistence or worsening of symptoms. Regular follow-up appointments are recommended to assess the effectiveness of the new medication and overall recovery. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I've reviewed your history and it seems like you've been experiencing a cough with mucous-purulent sputum and dyspnea for the past four weeks. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, that's correct. I've been having this cough and some difficulty breathing, but I don't smoke and haven't been around any substances that I know of that could cause lipoid pneumonia. Doctor: I see. Your past medical history is negative for exposure to such substances. You mentioned that you worked in a cotton factory for a few years, but apart from that, you haven't travelled recently or had any pets, right? Patient: That's correct. Doctor: You have been treated for atrial fibrillation with amiodarone for 30 years, along with systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypothyroidism, is that accurate? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: During your physical examination, you appeared well built and nourished with a pulse rate of 69 per minute and blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg. Your vital signs were within normal range with an SpO2 of 95% in room air. We did notice bibasal lung crackles, but there was no evidence of pallor, icterus, cyanosis, clubbing, or lymphadenopathy.  Patient: Okay, I understand. Doctor: Your blood work-up was within the normal range. However, the pulmonary function testing demonstrated moderate restrictive lung disease and a decreased diffusion capacity. We also conducted a chest X-ray which showed bilateral infiltrates. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: To further investigate, we performed a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) which revealed areas of ground glass appearance, particularly in the lower lobes of both lungs, and airspace consolidations were seen as well. Interestingly, the shadows improved 2 years later. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: We considered several possibilities like atypical pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, and tuberculosis, but TB was ruled out. We also had you undergo a fiberoptic bronchoscopy for bronchial wash and bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF) collection for immunological studies. Patient: What did the results show? Doctor: The bronchial washings were sent for smear for acid fast bacilli and cytological examination. No microorganisms were isolated by bacteriological examination and no malignant cells were found. The total cell count of the BALF was 287,500/ml, consisting of macrophages (64%), lymphocytes (31%), neutrophils (3%), and eosinophils (2%). Patient: So, what does that mean for me? Doctor: The results suggest that you have a non-infectious lung condition, and we'll continue to monitor it closely. We'll also adjust your treatment plan as needed to manage your symptoms effectively. Patient: Alright, thank you for the information, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Take care! [/INST] S: The patient reports a persistent cough with mucous-purulent sputum and dyspnea for four weeks.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, can you please tell me what brought you in today? Patient: Hi, I suffered from chest tightness seven months ago and was admitted to the hospital. Doctor: I see. Did you have any tests done at that time? Patient: Yes, the echography demonstrated that I had severe aortic and mitral valve regurgitation. Doctor: How were you treated for that? Patient: I had an open cardiac aortic valve replacement with a biological valve, 25#, Edwards, and a mitral valve repair. Doctor: And how was your recovery after the cardiac procedure? Patient: During the sixth-month follow-up, chest radiographs revealed suspected intimal patches of aortic arch and descending aorta. The thoracic aortic angiography showed an aortic dissecting aneurysm. Doctor: Oh, I see. Were there any indications of what might have caused the dissection? Patient: The doctors said it was about 4 cm above the coronary ostium, where the aortic cannula was placed. They thought it might be due to inappropriate string technique in surgery. Doctor: I understand. And how were you feeling at that time? Any chest pain, tightness, syncope, nausea, or vomiting? Patient: No, I didn't have any of those symptoms. Doctor: What happened after that? Patient: I received conservative medical treatment for one month, then came to your department for further treatment. Doctor: And what treatment did you receive here? Patient: I underwent endovascular stent-graft implantation and in situ laser fenestration for revascularization of aortic arch. Doctor: Can you please tell me about the procedure? Patient: A femoral vein-bilateral carotid bypass was established by femoral vein and bilateral carotid cannulation with 20 F and 12-16 F catheter sheaths. A stent release system was introduced, and the stent was released after my systolic blood pressure was reduced to 90 mmHg. Doctor: How was the laser fenestration done? Patient: The laser catheter was introduced through the left carotid artery, directly contacting the endograft membrane as perpendicularly as possible. Fenestration was made by applying 0.5 J energy with a holmium laser at a frequency of 5 Hz. Then, they did 4-mm balloon dilation and introduced a 0.035-in. stiff guidewire into the endograft lumen to introduce a bare stent. Doctor: And was the same procedure performed for the left carotid artery and left subclavian artery? Patient: Yes, the same procedure was done for both arteries. Doctor: How long did the operation take? Patient: The operation was completed within 4 hours, and the time of extracorporeal circulation was 56 minutes. Doctor: How has your recovery been since the procedure? Patient: I recovered without any clinical complications and was discharged five days after the procedure. Doctor: That's great to hear. Make sure to continue with your follow-up appointments to monitor your progress. If you experience any symptoms or have any concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us. [/INST] S: The patient reported initial symptoms of chest tightness seven months ago, leading to hospital admission. Diagnosed with severe aortic and mitral valve regurgitation, the patient underwent open cardiac aortic valve replacement and mitral valve repair. Six months post-operation, chest radiographs and thoracic aortic angiography indicated an aortic dissecting aneurysm, suspected to be caused by surgical technique during valve replacement. The patient did not experience chest pain, tightness, syncope, nausea, or vomiting. Recently, the patient underwent endovascular stent-graft implantation and in situ laser fenestration for revascularization of the aortic arch, recovering without clinical complications. O: Initial echography showed severe aortic and mitral valve regurgitation. Recent imaging revealed an aortic dissecting aneurysm approximately 4 cm above the coronary ostium. The patient underwent endovascular procedures including stent-graft implantation and laser fenestration, with successful revascularization of the aortic arch. The operation lasted 4 hours with 56 minutes of extracorporeal circulation. The patient was discharged five days post-procedure without clinical complications. A: The primary diagnosis is aortic dissecting aneurysm, likely secondary to surgical complications from previous valve replacement surgery. Differential diagnosis would consider other causes of aortic dissection not related to surgical intervention. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the successful recent intervention and lack of postoperative complications. P: The patient is advised to continue regular follow-up appointments to monitor the condition of the aortic arch and overall cardiac function. Monitoring for any new symptoms or complications is crucial. The patient should maintain a low-stress lifestyle and adhere to prescribed medications to manage blood pressure and prevent further arterial damage. Immediate medical attention should be sought for any new symptoms indicative of cardiac distress. </s>"

Patient: Well, doc, I've been having some trouble breathing recently. Doctor: I see. You mentioned you were treated for Bordetella bronchiseptica pneumonia and empyema two months ago with IV antibiotics and right pleural decortication. How did that go? Patient: Yeah, I got better and was discharged, but I ended up back in the hospital within a week with recurrent pneumonia. Doctor: During your first hospitalization, we conducted an evaluation that came back negative for HIV, hepatitis B infection, syphilis, blastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis. During the second hospitalization, you were treated with another 2-week course of antibiotics. Did you notice any improvement in your symptoms? Patient: Yes, I felt a bit better and was discharged again. But just two days later, I started having hypoxic respiratory failure. Doctor: That must have been tough. When you presented to our institute, we had to perform endotracheal intubation. On physical examination, we found fever, hypoxia, and tachycardia. We also noted oral candidiasis. How are you feeling now? Patient: Still not great, doc. My breathing is really rough. Doctor: I understand. On lung auscultation, we heard coarse and mechanical breath sounds bilaterally. Our chest radiographic findings showed bilateral patchy airspace opacities. The computed tomography scan of your chest revealed a stable, large anterior mediastinal mass, multiple cavitary lesions, and diffuse ground-glass opacities. We started you on broad-spectrum IV antibiotics with cefepime and vancomycin. The examination of your bronchoalveolar lavage revealed B bronchiseptica and Pneumocystis jirovecii. We then changed your antibiotic regimen to piperacillin/tazobactam, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim with prednisone, and fluconazole. Patient: Okay, I see. So, what's next? Doctor: We performed repeat HIV serology, which was negative. Your laboratory results showed panhypogammaglobulinemia and low total B- and CD4 T-cells. We have initiated IV immunoglobulin (IG) treatment at 400 mg/kg every 3-4 weeks to help improve your immune system. Patient: What about my thymoma? Can you do anything about that? Doctor: We evaluated you for a possible thymectomy, but unfortunately, due to your clinical condition, you are not currently a surgical candidate. Patient: I see. Anything else we can do? Doctor: At this point, we will continue to monitor your condition closely and adjust your treatment as needed. However, I must inform you that your clinical status has continued to deteriorate. Patient: I understand, doc. Thanks for everything you've done. [Patient's family joins the conversation] Family member: Thank you for taking care of our relative. We appreciate your efforts. [/INST] S: The patient is a 61-year-old homeless male with a history of benign spindle-cell thymoma, presenting with complaints of difficulty breathing. He reports a recent history of Bordetella bronchiseptica pneumonia and empyema treated with IV antibiotics and right pleural decortication, followed by recurrent pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient describes persistent respiratory distress despite treatment. O: Physical examination revealed fever, hypoxia, tachycardia, and oral candidiasis. Lung auscultation showed coarse, mechanical breath sounds bilaterally. Chest radiography indicated bilateral patchy airspace opacities, and CT scan displayed a stable large anterior mediastinal mass, multiple cavitary lesions, and diffuse ground-glass opacities. Bronchoalveolar lavage identified B. bronchiseptica and Pneumocystis jirovecii. Laboratory results showed panhypogammaglobulinemia and low total B- and CD4 T-cells. HIV serology was negative. A: The primary diagnosis is recurrent pneumonia complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure, with superimposed Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and oral candidiasis. The patient's immunocompromised state is evidenced by panhypogammaglobulinemia and low lymphocyte counts. The presence of a stable thymoma contributes to his complex clinical picture, though he is not a candidate for surgical intervention due to his deteriorating condition. P: The management plan includes continuation of broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam), antifungal treatment with fluconazole, and antipneumocystis therapy with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and prednisone. Initiation of IV immunoglobulin treatment at 400 mg/kg every 3-4 weeks is aimed at improving immune function. Close monitoring of his respiratory and immune status will be necessary, with adjustments to treatment as indicated by clinical and laboratory findings.

Do you have any allergies or take nutrient supplements? Patient: No, I don't have any allergies, and I don't take any supplements. Doctor: Have you ever had any surgeries or blood transfusions? Patient: No, I haven't. Doctor: Can you tell me more about when your current symptoms started and how they have progressed? Patient: I started taking Za ga-do Kowa in January 2016 for constipation. Around March 2016, I began experiencing heartburn and started taking Ohta-Isan and Gasuto-ru. Then, in early April, I started feeling malaise and epigastric pain. By mid-April, I noticed my skin turning yellowish. In May, my urine became dark brown and my stool turned somewhat whitish. Doctor: How have your symptoms been since then? Patient: They've been getting worse. Around mid-May, my malaise feelings increased, and on May 17th, I had significant nausea, loss of appetite, and even more malaise. So, I was admitted to a local clinic on May 19th. They referred me to your department, and I was admitted to Imabari Saiseikai Hospital. Doctor: Thank you for providing all that information. We will perform a physical examination and run some tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. [/INST] S: The patient, a 24-year smoker and social drinker, presents with epigastric pain, abdominal bloating post-eating, dark urine, and recent jaundice. Symptoms started in January 2016 with constipation, for which he took Za ga-do Kowa, followed by heartburn in March 2016, treated with Ohta-Isan and Gasuto-ru. By April 2016, he experienced malaise and epigastric pain, progressing to jaundice and dark brown urine by May 2016. His condition worsened by mid-May with significant nausea, loss of appetite, and increased malaise, leading to his admission to a local clinic and subsequent referral. O: Physical examination and diagnostic tests are planned to investigate the cause of the symptoms. No previous surgeries or blood transfusions reported. No allergies or supplement use noted. Family history includes uncle with colon and lung cancer but no known liver diseases. A: Differential diagnosis includes liver pathology potentially related to chronic smoking and alcohol use, considering the progression to jaundice and dark urine. Other considerations include gallbladder disease or pancreatic issues, given the epigastric location of pain and systemic symptoms. P: Plan to conduct a comprehensive physical examination and order liver function tests, abdominal ultrasound, and possibly a CT scan to assess liver, gallbladder, and pancreatic health. Depending on results, may refer to gastroenterology or hepatology. Patient education on smoking cessation and alcohol moderation will be provided, along with dietary recommendations to manage symptoms until a definitive diagnosis is made. Follow-up appointment will be scheduled post-test results to discuss findings and further management. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 61-year-old right-handed male, and you're a carrier with 89 CGG repeats. Do you have any history of tremor? Patient: No, I don't have any history of tremor. Doctor: Alright. Have you ever experienced any falling incidents? Patient: No, I haven't had any history of falling, but I did experience some unsteadiness when turning around. Doctor: I see. That might possibly be due to the 4 cm difference in your leg lengths, which is secondary to a congenital vascular malformation in one of your legs that impacted its growth. Let's move on to your examination results. Your blood pressure was 107/68 mmHg, and your heart rate was 55 bpm. Your BMI is 26.5. During the finger-to-nose touching test, there was no sign of tremor. However, you had some mild balance problems while turning and showed instability on tandem walking during the first few steps. Were you able to improve with practice? Patient: Yes, after some practice, I was able to perform at least 6 steps without missteps. Doctor: That's good to hear. Regarding your reflexes, they were normal in your upper extremities and knees, all at +2. Your right ankle reflex was 1+, but there was no reflex in your left ankle. We also found that you have decreased vibration sense bilaterally in both big toes, but normal vibration sense at the ankles bilaterally. Additionally, your pinprick sensation was slightly decreased in the great toe.  Patient: Hmm, I see. Doctor: On the neuropsychological examination, we didn't detect any cognitive abnormalities, and you haven't reported any psychiatric symptoms either, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Lastly, your MRI results showed the MCP sign and white matter hyperintensity in the splenium of the corpus callosum, which indicates some issues in your brain. Moreover, you also have mild brain atrophy.  Patient: Oh, I didn't expect that. Doctor: I understand it might be concerning, but we will monitor your condition and work on a suitable treatment plan for you. Please make sure to schedule follow-up appointments and report any new or worsening symptoms.  Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The 61-year-old right-handed male patient reports no history of tremor or falling incidents but experiences unsteadiness when turning around. He has a congenital vascular malformation leading to a 4 cm leg length discrepancy. O: Vital signs include blood pressure at 107/68 mmHg and heart rate at 55 bpm. BMI is recorded at 26.5. Neurological examination shows no tremor during the finger-to-nose test, mild balance issues, and instability in tandem walking initially, which improved with practice. Reflexes are normal in upper extremities and knees (+2), with diminished reflex in the right ankle (1+) and absent reflex in the left ankle. Decreased vibration sense in both big toes and slightly decreased pinprick sensation in the great toe were noted. Neuropsychological examination did not reveal cognitive or psychiatric abnormalities. MRI findings include the MCP sign, white matter hyperintensity in the splenium of the corpus callosum, and mild brain atrophy. A: The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a neurological condition possibly linked to his genetic background (89 CGG repeats) and structural brain changes noted on MRI. Differential diagnoses could include mild cerebellar ataxia or another form of neurodegenerative disorder. The leg length discrepancy and congenital vascular malformation are contributing to his balance issues. P: Plan to monitor neurological status regularly and manage symptoms of imbalance and sensory deficits. Recommend physical therapy to address balance and coordination issues. Follow-up MRI and neurological evaluation in six months or sooner if symptoms worsen. Encourage the patient to report new symptoms or changes in existing symptoms promptly. Discuss potential genetic counseling given the presence of CGG repeats and family planning implications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've presented today with a history of recurrent sharp interscapular pain radiating to the mid-sternal and epigastric region, associated with refractory nausea and vomiting for the past three weeks. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, the pain has been getting worse, and I've been experiencing constant nausea and vomiting. It's been really hard for me to deal with all this. Doctor: I understand. Your medical records mention that you had a cholecystectomy two years ago for intermittent epigastric pain. At that time, a CT abdomen revealed a mass measuring 5.4 x 5.0 cm. It was subsequently diagnosed as a bronchogenic cyst after an EUS. You had an EBUS guided aspiration, and you were discharged after partial improvement. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Based on your current physical examination, your heart rate is 126/min, which is above the normal range of 60-100/min, and respiratory rate is 20/min, at the upper end of the normal range of 12-20/min. Your initial labs showed a white cell count of 10.58 x 10^3/uL, which is within the normal range, but you have elevated inflammatory markers, such as an ESR of 63 mm/hr and a CRP of 116 mg/L. Additionally, you have hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: It's concerning, but we're here to help you. Your electrocardiogram also showed non-specific T wave changes. We performed a chest X-ray, which revealed a right posterior mediastinal mass. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: A CT chest scan showed an increase in the size of the bronchogenic cyst to 9.64 x 7.7 cm, along with a small right pleural effusion. The X-ray and CT findings suggest that you may have a partial cyst rupture or an infected cyst. We performed an X-ray esophagogram, which ruled out esophageal compression or contrast extravasation. Patient: So what can be done to help with my symptoms? Doctor: Your symptoms have been refractory to conservative analgesic and antiemetic measures like Dilaudid (hydromorphone) 1 mg IV every 3 hours and Zofran (Ondansetron) 4 mg IV every 4 hours for pain and nausea/vomiting, respectively. We consulted cardiothoracic surgery, and they recommended surgical intervention. Patient: What does the surgery involve? Doctor: The patient underwent a right thoracotomy and surgical cyst excision. The cyst pathology showed severe inflammatory changes. Patient: And how did the surgery go? Doctor: The surgery went well, and within 24-48 hours after the surgery, you should start experiencing some relief from your symptoms. We will continue to monitor your progress closely and provide any necessary follow-up care. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all your help in figuring out what's been causing my pain and discomfort. [/INST] S: The patient reports recurrent sharp interscapular pain radiating to the mid-sternal and epigastric region, associated with constant nausea and vomiting for the past three weeks. The patient has a history of cholecystectomy and was previously diagnosed with a bronchogenic cyst. O: Physical examination shows a heart rate of 126/min and respiratory rate of 20/min. Labs indicate a white cell count of 10.58 x 10^3/uL, ESR 63 mm/hr, CRP 116 mg/L, and hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. ECG shows non-specific T wave changes. Imaging reveals an enlarged bronchogenic cyst measuring 9.64 x 7.7 cm with a small right pleural effusion and no esophageal compression. The patient has been on Dilaudid 1 mg IV every 3 hours and Zofran 4 mg IV every 4 hours with refractory symptoms. A: Primary diagnosis is an enlarged, possibly infected or partially ruptured bronchogenic cyst. Differential diagnoses could include other mediastinal masses or complications from previous surgeries. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic post-surgery, pending no complications. P: The patient underwent a right thoracotomy and surgical cyst excision. Post-operative care includes monitoring vital signs, managing pain, and preventing infection. Follow-up will involve reassessment of symptoms and additional imaging to ensure no recurrence. Education on signs of infection and when to seek immediate care is provided. Referral to cardiothoracic surgery for further evaluation and management was completed. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, what brings you to the urology clinic today? Patient: My son has been having severe decreased urinary force and caliber for about a month now. He also mentioned dysuria, but no other lower urinary tract symptoms, intermittent hematuria, or downward urination. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your son's past medical history? Patient: Yes, he was circumcised when he was just one year old. Doctor: Alright, let's do a physical examination to get a better understanding of what's going on. *After examining the patient* Upon initial inspection, the glans, meatus, and penile shaft seem normal. However, with a more precise inspection, I've detected a deep circular sharp cut in the peno-glanular junction (Fig.). Patient: Oh no! What does that mean, doctor? Doctor: We'll need to take your son to the operating room to address this issue. Under local anesthesia and loupe magnification(X4), we found a neglected Plastibell remnant string. We removed it with an eye scissor and inserted a 6 French Foley catheter in his urethra for two weeks. Patient: I see. What's the next step for my son? Doctor: Your son will be referred to a tertiary urethral and penile reconstructive center for further treatment. Unfortunately, I have to inform you that the penile glans auto amputation occurred spontaneously after 45 days during his daily activities with minimal bleeding (Fig.). Patient: Oh my! What can be done now? Doctor: We've inserted the Foley catheter again for 2 weeks, and we're recommending a watchful waiting approach for three months. Currently, he is being managed conservatively with daily urethral self-dilation and is a candidate for future reconstructive surgery. Patient: Thank you, doctor, for the information and guidance. We'll make sure to follow your recommendations and look forward to the reconstructive surgery. [/INST] S: The patient's mother reports that her son has been experiencing severe decreased urinary force and caliber for about a month, along with dysuria. No other lower urinary tract symptoms, intermittent hematuria, or downward urination were noted. The patient has a past medical history of circumcision at one year old. O: Physical examination revealed normal appearance of the glans, meatus, and penile shaft. However, a deep circular sharp cut was detected at the peno-glanular junction. Under local anesthesia and loupe magnification (X4), a neglected Plastibell remnant string was found and removed. A 6 French Foley catheter was inserted in his urethra for two weeks. Subsequent complications included spontaneous penile glans auto-amputation after 45 days with minimal bleeding. A: The primary diagnosis is a complication from a neglected Plastibell remnant leading to severe urethral stricture and spontaneous penile glans auto-amputation. Differential diagnosis would consider other causes of urethral stricture or obstruction. The prognosis includes potential for significant reconstructive challenges but is manageable with appropriate surgical intervention. P: Immediate management involved removal of the Plastibell remnant and urethral catheterization. The patient is referred to a tertiary urethral and penile reconstructive center for further treatment. Conservative management includes daily urethral self-dilation and a watchful waiting approach for three months. The patient is a candidate for future reconstructive surgery. The family has been advised to adhere to the treatment plan and prepare for possible surgical interventions. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you tell me what brings you to the ER today? Patient: My 7-month-old son had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and we don't know why. He's never had any trauma or febrile illness before. Doctor: I see. Let's do a physical exam to check his overall health. Has he been taking any supplements or vitamins? Patient: He was exclusively breastfed and only had a multivitamin supplement for the first three months of his life. Doctor: Okay, let's see. His physical exam shows that he has short stature, with a length of 64 cm, which is less than the 5th percentile, but his weight is 9.2 kg, which is at the 75th percentile. His neurologic exam demonstrated brisk patellar reflexes. The remainder of his physical exam appears unremarkable. We'll run some initial labs to get a better understanding of his condition. (Later) Doctor: The lab results showed that your son has severe hypocalcemia. His total serum calcium is 5.9 mg/dl, and the normal range is 8.5-10.9 mg/dl. His ionized calcium is .67 mmol/L, which is also below the normal range of 1.18-1.29 mmol/L. We treated him with IV calcium, but his calcium levels only rose slightly and are still significantly below the normal range. Patient: Oh no, what could be causing this? Doctor: We conducted a further evaluation and found that his 25-hydroxy vitamin D level is undetectable, at less than 4 ng/ml. He also has elevated parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase levels. A skeletal survey showed rachitic changes in his bones. Patient: What does this mean for my son? Doctor: Your son has been diagnosed with nutritional rickets. We will start him on a vitamin D stosstherapy treatment with ergocalciferol, which is an oral solution provided by Virtus Pharmaceuticals. He'll receive 100,000 international units every 2 hours for a total of 600,000 international units over 12 hours. (After Treatment) Patient: Doctor, my son seems lethargic and his urine output has decreased from 2.1 cc/kg/hr before treatment to .7 cc/kg/hr after treatment. What's happening? Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. The labs indicate that he has developed acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia. His creatinine level has risen from .41 mg/dl pretreatment to 3.0 mg/dl following stosstherapy over a 36-hour timespan. Patient: What can we do to help him? Doctor: We will treat him with fluid resuscitation, diuretics, and sodium polystyrene to address his renal failure and other complications. We'll continue to monitor his condition closely and adjust his treatment as needed. [/INST] S: The patient, a 7-month-old male, presented with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, his first such episode, with no prior history of trauma or febrile illness. The mother reported exclusive breastfeeding and a multivitamin supplement during the first three months of life. O: Physical examination revealed short stature (length 64 cm, <5th percentile) and normal weight (9.2 kg, 75th percentile). Neurologic examination showed brisk patellar reflexes. Initial labs indicated severe hypocalcemia with a total serum calcium of 5.9 mg/dl (normal range 8.5-10.9 mg/dl) and ionized calcium of .67 mmol/L (normal range 1.18-1.29 mmol/L). Further evaluation showed undetectable 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels (<4 ng/ml), elevated parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase levels. Skeletal survey demonstrated rachitic changes. A: The primary diagnosis is nutritional rickets, evidenced by severe hypocalcemia, undetectable vitamin D levels, and skeletal changes. Differential diagnosis initially included other causes of seizures but was narrowed down following lab results and imaging. Complications arose post-treatment, including acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia, likely secondary to stosstherapy with ergocalciferol. P: The management plan includes administration of IV calcium and high-dose vitamin D stosstherapy (600,000 international units over 12 hours). Post-treatment complications are being addressed with fluid resuscitation, diuretics, and sodium polystyrene. Ongoing monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is crucial, with adjustments to therapy as needed. Education regarding the importance of balanced nutrition and vitamin supplementation in infants will be provided to the mother. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you've been referred to our institution from a private infertility clinic, is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. I've been experiencing lower abdominal pain and I'm quite worried about it. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your history of amenorrhea? How long has it been since your last menstrual period? Patient: I've had no period for about 5 weeks and 4 days now. Doctor: I also see that you underwent intrauterine insemination (IUI) 27 days ago. Can you tell me about the process you went through for that? Patient: Sure. I had ovarian hyperstimulation with Clomiphene citrate 100 mg daily during the 3rd to 7th days of my cycle, followed by 75 IU hMG daily on the 7th to 9th days. A transvaginal ultrasound showed four dominant follicles in my left ovary after the stimulation. Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. Now, during the physical examination, we found that you had normal vital signs but also diffuse lower abdominal tenderness. We also checked your serum beta-chorionic gonadotropin level, which was 3154 mUI/mL. Patient: Oh, okay. What does that mean? Doctor: It can be an indicator of pregnancy. We performed a transvaginal ultrasound and found a large hyperechoic mass, suspected to be a hematoma, in the cul-de-sac. It also showed a normal-sized uterus without an intrauterine gestational sac, endometrial thickening of 20 mm, and both right and left adnexa appeared normal on the ultrasound. Patient: Hmm, I see. Doctor: Your initial complete blood count showed a hematocrit of 35.9%, hemoglobin of 11.9 g/dL, white blood cells at 9.3 × 109/L, and platelets at 252 × 109/L. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: Based on these results, our provisional diagnosis is a ruptured ectopic pregnancy with hemoperitoneum. We performed an emergency laparoscopy to further investigate. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it can be. Intraoperatively, we found a dark blood clot of about 800 ml along with a small amount of fresh blood. We also discovered an approximately 2 × 2 × 1.5 cm unruptured ectopic pregnancy in your right fallopian tube, while the left fallopian tube appeared normal. Patient: What about my ovaries? Doctor: While examining your ovaries to locate the cause of the bleeding, we observed minimal bleeding from the proximal pole of the left ovary, where there was a 1.0 × 0.5 × 0.5 cm hemorrhagic mass with surrounding tissue. Patient: What are the next steps for me? Doctor: We will closely monitor your condition and provide appropriate treatment to address the ectopic pregnancy and bleeding. It is essential for you to follow up with us regularly to ensure your recovery and discuss any further concerns you may have. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all the information and support.

They usually happen in the late afternoon, and I also have night sweats, frontal headaches, tender cervical lymphadenopathy, anorexia, and malaise. Doctor: I see. Have you seen any other doctors about this issue? Patient: Yes, I saw my primary care physician two weeks ago. They diagnosed me with a viral illness and recommended supportive care. I also went to the emergency department, and they said it was lymphadenitis. They prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, but I don't recall the dose and wasn't able to finish the whole course. Doctor: Did your symptoms improve after the treatments? Patient: No, my symptoms persisted, and I also developed bilateral periorbital swelling and non-bloody diarrhea. That's why I came here. Doctor: I understand. Do you have any cough, chest pain, dysuria, abdominal pain, arthralgia, rash, recent travel or sick contacts? Patient: No, I don't have any of those. Doctor: Your vital signs show that you are not in distress, with a blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg, but you're febrile with a temperature of 39.6 C and tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 bpm. Our physical exam found bilateral periorbital swelling with violet discoloration of the eyelids, conjunctival pallor, and painless bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. No rash or joint swelling was noted. Patient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Yes, we need to investigate further. Your complete blood count revealed leukopenia with a white cell count of 2.9 x 10^3/mcL (65% neutrophils, 13% lymphocytes, 13% bands), microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 8.5 gr/dL (mean corpuscular volume 65 fL), and 181 x 10^3/mcL platelets. Your C-reactive protein (CPR) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) level were markedly elevated at 51 and 84 respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and haptoglobin were also elevated. The good news is that you tested negative for β-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), HIV, hepatitis B and C, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and antinuclear antibodies. Patient: So, what does all of that mean? Doctor: These results indicate that you have an ongoing inflammatory process. The exact cause is not yet clear, but we can rule out some common infections and autoimmune diseases. We need to do further testing and monitoring to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. Patient: Okay, what do I need to do next? Doctor: We will schedule additional tests and closely monitor your condition. In the meantime, please continue with supportive care and try to complete the full course of the prescribed antibiotics if possible. We will also discuss your case with a specialist to determine the best course of action. Patient: Alright, thank you for your help. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to find the cause and help you recover as soon as possible. [/INST] S: 20-year-old African American female presents with a 3-week history of fevers, night sweats, frontal headaches, tender cervical lymphadenopathy, anorexia, and malaise.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been experiencing episodes of atrial tachycardia and I'm quite worried about it. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a bit more about your medical history? Patient: Yes, I'm a 39-year-old female and I have a univentricular heart condition called tricuspid atresia. I've had two cardiac surgeries in the past, the last one being an atrio-pulmonary Fontan surgery 33 years ago. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Due to your serious right atriomegaly and frequent episodes of atrial tachycardia, you might be a candidate for Fontan conversion surgery. Before the surgery, it's important to note that your pre-operative ventricular function is mildly reduced at 50%. Patient: Okay, what can I expect after the surgery? Doctor: In some cases, patients may experience severe single ventricle dysfunction post-operatively, which can result in low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) and the need for ECMO implantation. Patient: That sounds serious. What if I can't be weaned off the ECMO? Doctor: Unfortunately, in some cases where patients cannot be weaned from ECMO due to multi-organ failure, they may not survive. However, many patients do successfully recover from the surgery. Patient: I understand. What about other complications after the surgery? Doctor: Some patients may require pacemaker implantation due to post-operative sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular conduction abnormalities. All patients are discharged on oral antiarrhythmic medication for 3-6 months and anticoagulants for 6 months. At discharge, most patients are in sinus rhythm, some have a stable pacemaker rhythm, and a few have atrial fibrillation or flutter. Patient: If I need a pacemaker, when would that happen? Doctor: In some cases, a patient may need a pacemaker implant a few months after the operation due to the presence of sinus node dysfunction. Patient: How can I expect to feel after the surgery? Doctor: During a median follow-up of 14 months, many patients show an improvement in their NYHA functional class. Some patients in NYHA class III progress to class II or even class I, while others in class II progress to class I. Patient: What about the recurrence of arrhythmia? Doctor: Recurrence of arrhythmia occurs in about 8.6% of patients more than 3 months after surgery. These patients usually have a history of atrial fibrillation and are treated with right-sided Maze rather than Cox maze III due to technical issues. Patient: And what about my electrocardiogram at follow-up? Doctor: At follow-up, most patients are in sinus rhythm, some have stable pacemaker rhythm, and a few have permanent atrial fibrillation. Patient: What about anti-arrhythmic therapy? Doctor: At a median follow-up of 14 months, about 69% of patients are in stable sinus rhythm, with 12 of them not requiring any anti-arrhythmic therapy. Patient: Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We are here to help you through this process. [/INST] S: The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of tricuspid atresia and previous atrio-pulmonary Fontan surgery. She reports experiencing episodes of atrial tachycardia, which is her chief complaint. She expresses concern about her condition and potential upcoming surgical interventions. O: The patient has a history of univentricular heart condition and has undergone two cardiac surgeries, the last being 33 years ago. Her pre-operative ventricular function is mildly reduced at 50%. She is currently experiencing serious right atriomegaly and frequent episodes of atrial tachycardia. A: Primary diagnosis is atrial tachycardia in the context of a univentricular heart condition with a history of Fontan surgery. The patient is a candidate for Fontan conversion surgery, with potential complications including severe single ventricle dysfunction, low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), need for ECMO implantation, and possible pacemaker implantation due to sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular conduction abnormalities. P: Plan to proceed with pre-operative evaluations for Fontan conversion surgery. Educate the patient on the risks of severe single ventricle dysfunction post-operatively, potential need for ECMO, and the possibility of not being weaned off ECMO. Discuss the likelihood of needing a pacemaker implant post-surgery and the management of arrhythmias with oral antiarrhythmic medication for 3-6 months and anticoagulants for 6 months post-discharge. Follow-up includes monitoring for recurrence of arrhythmia and assessment of NYHA functional class improvement. Ensure patient understands the management plan and provide emotional support and reassurance. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you have a history of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with a prior stroke, chronic obstructive lung disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic foot ulcers, and frequent falls. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Can you tell me about any recent falls you've had? Patient: I actually had a fall 5 days after I got a Watchman™ device placed. Doctor: I see. Your history of atrial fibrillation has been complicated with multiple episodes of syncope, despite various antiarrhythmic therapy strategies. You were previously on dabigatran, which caused severe bruising, and rivaroxaban, which gave you headaches. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: After discussing with your cardiologist, a Watchman™ device was placed given your high thrombotic risk and prior complications with oral antithrombotic therapy. Your CHADS2-VASC2 score is 6 and HAS-BLED score is 4. You were started on apixaban 5 mg twice daily, plus aspirin 81 mg daily for continuation for the following 45 days. However, you presented to the emergency room 5 days after the device placement with lethargy, fever, and hypotension. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: You were found to be in septic shock from methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Your hemodynamics and mental status initially improved in the intensive care unit (ICU) on vasopressors, stress dose steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. These were subsequently narrowed to intravenous vancomycin. In addition, your apixaban was transitioned to intravenous unfractionated heparin upon presentation to the ICU. Is this all correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Despite hemodynamic improvement, your mental status worsened. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed multiple acute small punctuate infarcts in the left corona radiata, right occipital cortex, and right frontal deep white matter. These multifocal strokes were thought to be cardioembolic, not septic in origin. Did you miss any doses of apixaban after the device placement? Patient: Yes, I have to admit that I missed a few doses. Doctor: A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was obtained to further assess your condition. It's important to follow your medication regimen to avoid any complications. Moving forward, we will continue to monitor your progress and adjust your medications as needed. Please make sure to take your medications as prescribed and to report any further symptoms or issues. Patient: Okay, I'll make sure to follow the medication regimen and keep you updated. Doctor: Thank you. We'll work together to manage your condition and improve your health. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Patient: Thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, prior stroke, chronic obstructive lung disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic foot ulcers, and frequent falls, reports a recent fall 5 days post Watchman™ device placement. The patient experienced complications from previous antithrombotic therapies, including severe bruising from dabigatran and headaches from rivaroxaban. Recently, the patient presented with lethargy, fever, and hypotension, diagnosed as septic shock from MRSA bacteremia, and admitted missing several doses of apixaban post-device placement. O: Vital signs at ER presentation indicated hypotension. Lab results confirmed MRSA bacteremia. MRI of the brain showed multiple acute small punctuate infarcts in the left corona radiata, right occipital cortex, and right frontal deep white matter, indicative of cardioembolic strokes. The patient was treated in the ICU with vasopressors, stress dose steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, later narrowed to intravenous vancomycin. Apixaban was switched to intravenous unfractionated heparin. CHADS2-VASC2 score is 6, HAS-BLED score is 4. A: Primary diagnosis is cardioembolic strokes secondary to nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, complicated by MRSA bacteremia and septic shock post Watchman™ device placement. Differential diagnosis includes septic emboli, although MRI findings suggest cardioembolic origin. The missed doses of apixaban likely contributed to the stroke risk. P: Continue monitoring in the ICU with adjustments to anticoagulation therapy as needed. Maintain intravenous vancomycin until infection parameters improve. Reinforce the importance of adherence to prescribed medication regimen, specifically apixaban, to prevent further thromboembolic events. Schedule follow-up appointments with cardiology and primary care to reassess anticoagulation therapy and overall health status. Educate patient on recognizing symptoms of stroke and infection, and the importance of timely medication administration. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you have a history of urothelial bladder cancer and you're a former smoker. Can you tell me what brought you in today? Patient: Yeah, I've been having some chest pain when I exert myself, like when I exercise or do something strenuous. Doctor: I see. Can you describe the chest pain for me? Patient: It's right in the middle of my chest and feels like pressure. It gets worse when I'm active and goes away when I rest. Doctor: Have you experienced any sweating or palpitations along with the chest pain? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those. Doctor: We performed an exercise stress test on you, and it showed inferior wall ischemic changes. We decided to bring you in for an elective angiogram to further investigate the issue. Upon admission, you were afebrile with a blood pressure of 147/85 mm/Hg and a regular heart rate of 79 beats/minute. Your ECG showed a sinus rhythm with a right bundle branch block, but no ST segment or T wave changes indicative of ischemia. Your lab tests, including troponin, lipid profiles, and fasting blood glucose, were all within normal limits. Patient: Okay, so what happened during the angiogram? Doctor: We referred you to the catheterization lab for a coronary angiogram through the right femoral artery. Cannulation of the right coronary ostia revealed an anomalous origin of the left circumflex artery and the right coronary artery from a shared ostium. The right coronary artery had 80% stenosis in the middle and distal segments, and the right posterior descending artery had 70% stenosis in the proximal segment. The left circumflex artery, however, didn't show any significant stenosis. Patient: And what about the left coronary ostia? Doctor: While looking for the left coronary ostia, we discovered the anomalous origin of the left anterior descending artery from the right coronary cusp. It arose just anterior to the shared ostium of the right coronary artery and left circumflex artery, but it didn't have any stenosis. Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: We decided to abort the procedure to perform a cardiac multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) to further study the anatomy of your coronary arteries. This will help us determine the best course of action for your treatment. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. I'll await the results of the MDCT and the next steps. [/INST] S: The patient, a former smoker with a history of urothelial bladder cancer, presents with exertional chest pain described as pressure in the middle of the chest, which resolves with rest. The patient denies associated symptoms of sweating or palpitations. O: On examination, the patient was afebrile, with blood pressure at 147/85 mmHg and heart rate at 79 beats/minute. An exercise stress test indicated inferior wall ischemic changes. ECG showed sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block, without ischemic changes. Lab tests including troponin, lipid profiles, and fasting glucose were within normal limits. Coronary angiogram revealed an anomalous origin of the left circumflex and right coronary artery from a shared ostium, with 80% stenosis in the middle and distal segments of the right coronary artery and 70% stenosis in the proximal segment of the right posterior descending artery. The left anterior descending artery also had an anomalous origin but no stenosis. A: The primary diagnosis is coronary artery disease, specifically significant stenosis in the right coronary artery and right posterior descending artery, with an anomalous coronary artery origin. Differential diagnosis could include other causes of chest pain such as musculoskeletal pain, but these are less likely given the angiographic findings and exertional nature of the pain. P: The plan includes performing a cardiac multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) to further assess the coronary anatomy. Based on the MDCT results, intervention such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting may be considered. The patient will be advised to avoid strenuous activities until further management decisions are made. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to review the MDCT results and discuss treatment options. Patient education regarding signs of worsening cardiac symptoms and when to seek emergency care will be provided. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Good morning. I see here that you're a frail 86-year-old female experiencing dyspnea on exertion. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, doctor. I've been having trouble breathing, especially when I try to do any activity. Doctor: I understand. Your brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated at >900, which indicates that you might have severe AS. Due to your high surgical risk (the Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score of 9.8%), you've been referred to our institution for treatment. Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for me, doctor? Doctor: We performed a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and found that you have not only severe AS (aortic valve area of 0.58 cm2 and peak velocity of 4.0 m/s), but also diffuse left ventricular hypertrophy, except in the posterior wall, which is a Maron type III hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. You also have LVOT obstruction with systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, leading to moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). Patient: That sounds quite serious. Doctor: Yes, it is. During a Valsalva maneuver, your peak velocity was 2.9 m/s, and the mean pressure gradient was 32 mmHg at the LVOT. After administering a beta-blocker (bisoprolol 1.25 mg/day), the LVOT obstruction and SAM disappeared, and MR was reduced to a mild degree. However, your peak velocity across the aortic valve and BNP level remain high, so we've planned a TAVI to treat your AS. Patient: What does that involve? Doctor: Coronary angiography confirmed the first major septal branch perfusing the basal septum. We'll consider ASA as a rescue option for recurrence of LVOT obstruction. We'll implant a 23 mm SAPIEN 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) via transfemoral approach with general anesthesia and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guidance, under continuous infusion of a beta-blocker (landiolol) and volume load. Patient: Okay, and what happens after that? Doctor: Five minutes after implantation, we'll check for any LVOT obstruction and SAM. In your case, there was no obvious LVOT obstruction and SAM after 5 minutes. However, 15 minutes later, TEE showed SAM and severe MR, and the pressure gradient was >50 mmHg at the LVOT, even under increased doses of beta-blockers. Patient: Oh no, what does that mean for me? Doctor: Your hemodynamic status became rapidly unstable, so we decided to perform an emergent ASA. We'll use a 2 mm over-the-wire balloon and microbubble to help stabilize your condition. Patient: I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do everything we can to ensure the best possible outcome for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. [/INST] S: The patient is an 86-year-old female presenting with dyspnea on exertion. She reports difficulty breathing, particularly during physical activity. Her medical history is significant for severe aortic stenosis (AS) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. O: The patient's BNP level is elevated at >900 pg/mL. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed severe AS with an aortic valve area of 0.58 cm2 and a peak velocity of 4.0 m/s. Additionally, diffuse left ventricular hypertrophy was noted, except in the posterior wall, classified as Maron type III hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. There is also left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction with systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, causing moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). After administration of bisoprolol 1.25 mg/day, LVOT obstruction and SAM resolved, and MR was reduced to mild. However, peak velocity across the aortic valve and BNP levels remained high. Coronary angiography confirmed the first major septal branch perfusing the basal septum. Post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), TEE showed recurrence of SAM and severe MR with a pressure gradient >50 mmHg at the LVOT under increased doses of beta-blockers. A: The primary diagnosis is severe AS complicated by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with LVOT obstruction and SAM. The patient's condition is further complicated by recurrent SAM and severe MR post-TAVI, leading to hemodynamic instability. P: The management plan included the implantation of a 23 mm SAPIEN 3 valve via transfemoral approach with TEE guidance and continuous infusion of beta-blockers. Post-implantation complications were managed with emergent alcohol septal ablation (ASA) using a 2 mm over-the-wire balloon and microbubble. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of beta-blocker therapy are necessary to manage LVOT obstruction and SAM. Further follow-up and supportive care will be required to monitor the patient's condition and manage any additional complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, I understand you recently visited the emergency department for abdominal pain. How are you feeling now? Patient: Yeah, I was in so much pain, but it's much better now, thanks. Doctor: That's good to hear. We performed a CT scan of your abdomen and found bilateral renal masses: 2.4 cm on the right and 7.6 cm on the left. We also saw multiple small cysts in your lung bases. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Your abdominal pain has resolved with conservative management alone, which is a good sign. We referred you to urology, and they recommended resecting your left kidney tumor and deferring the right one pending pathology results. Do you have any prior medical history or relevant surgical history? Patient: No, I've been healthy and well. I don't have any medical history or surgeries. Doctor: That's good to know. Do any of your family members have lung, skin, or kidney symptoms? Patient: No, my siblings, parents, and my 15-year-old son are all healthy. Doctor: Great. We didn't find any consistent skin findings on your exam. We also conducted a pulmonary evaluation with a CT of your chest, which identified basilar predominant multiple lung cysts, with the largest one measuring approximately 1.6 cm. There were several partially solid nodules less than 6 mm as well. Your spirometry, diffusion capacity, and plethysmography were all within normal limits. Patient: Oh, okay. But I've been having some mild breathing problems lately. Doctor: That could be related to the cysts. You mentioned intermittent dyspnea and a significant anxiety component. We'll keep an eye on that. You eventually underwent resection of your left kidney mass with a partial nephrectomy. The pathologic diagnosis is an oncocytoma, which is a typical tumor type for Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. Your postoperative course was unremarkable, and we have a planned sequential right nephrectomy pending further evaluation. Patient: So, do I have this Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome? Doctor: We suspected Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome given your lung cysts and bilateral renal masses, but without skin findings, the diagnosis was uncertain. There are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria, but typically, skin findings or a pathologic mutation must accompany the lung and kidney pathology to confirm the diagnosis. We performed genetic testing via a blood sample and sequenced your FLCN gene to look for any deletions or duplications. Patient: What were the results of the genetic test? Doctor: We're still waiting for the results to come back. Once we have them, we'll have a clearer understanding of your condition and can discuss the next steps in your treatment plan. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. Doctor: Of course, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We'll be in touch once we have the genetic test results, and we'll discuss the best course of action going forward. Take care! [/INST] S: The patient, who recently experienced severe abdominal pain now resolved, reports intermittent dyspnea and significant anxiety. No prior medical or surgical history. No family history of lung, skin, or kidney symptoms. O: CT abdomen revealed bilateral renal masses (2.4 cm right, 7.6 cm left) and multiple small lung cysts. Largest lung cyst measured 1.6 cm with several partially solid nodules less than 6 mm. Pulmonary function tests within normal limits. Postoperative status post left partial nephrectomy; pathology confirmed an oncocytoma. Genetic testing for Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome via FLCN gene sequencing is pending. A: Primary diagnosis of oncocytoma with suspicion of Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome based on renal and pulmonary findings, though the absence of skin findings and pending genetic results make the diagnosis uncertain. Differential diagnosis includes other causes of renal masses and lung cysts. P: Continue monitoring patient's respiratory symptoms. Plan for sequential right nephrectomy pending further evaluation. Await genetic testing results to confirm or rule out Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome and guide further management. Educate patient on potential diagnosis and implications. Ensure follow-up for test results and postoperative care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see from your past medical history that you had uterine cancer 25 years ago, a herpes-zoster infection two years ago, and a recent diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. You're also being investigated for cervical adenopathies. What brings you to the Infectious Diseases Unit today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. For the past 3 weeks, I've had a fever, lost about 20 kg in weight, and I've been coughing up blood. I've also had diarrhea for about a year now. Doctor: I see. Let's perform a physical examination. Hmm, you appear cachectic and weak. Your axillary temperature is 38°C, blood pressure is 112/80 mmHg, respiration rate is 40 per minute, heart rate is 142 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95% in room air. I also noticed pain and tenderness when I palpated your hypogastric region. Patient: Yes, it's been really uncomfortable lately. Doctor: During our consultation, you went into cardiorespiratory arrest. We performed advanced life support, which fortunately had a favorable response. You were then transferred to the emergency room where we had to initiate aminergic support and proceed with orotracheal intubation and mechanical invasive ventilation. Patient: That was a scary experience. Doctor: I understand. We conducted some complementary diagnostic exams. Your white blood cell count is 14,740/μL with an absolute neutrophil count of 13,180/μL (89.4%) and an absolute lymphocyte count of 970/μL (6.6%) with 113 CD4+/μL cells. Your hemoglobin level is 11.3 g/d, and your platelet count is 2,33,000/μL.  Patient: What does that mean, Doctor? Doctor: These results indicate an infection and possible immune suppression. Additionally, your blood creatinine is 1.34 mg/dL, pancreatic amylase is 222 U/L (which is 4 times above the upper limit of normal), pancreatic lipase is 174 U/L (3 times above the upper limit of normal), and seric lactates are 6.5 mmol/L. Your viral load of HIV by polymerase chain reaction is 2,330,220 copies/mL. Patient: That sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it is a cause for concern. We also performed a thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan. It revealed pneumoperitoneum, peritonitis, diffuse parietal thickening, and dilatation of the intestinal loops of the jejunum with splenic infarction. Patient: What are the next steps? Doctor: Given the severity of your condition, we will proceed with an emerging surgery called exploratory laparotomy to further investigate and treat the issues found in your CT scan. Patient: Alright, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. We will do our best to help you through this challenging time. If you or your family have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of uterine cancer, herpes-zoster, and recent HIV diagnosis, presents with a 3-week history of fever, significant weight loss (20 kg), hemoptysis, and chronic diarrhea persisting for a year. The patient also reports hypogastric pain and tenderness. O: Physical examination shows the patient is cachectic and weak with vital signs: axillary temperature 38°C, blood pressure 112/80 mmHg, respiration rate 40/min, heart rate 142 bpm, and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Lab findings include elevated white blood cell count at 14,740/μL, neutrophils 89.4%, lymphocytes 6.6%, CD4 count 113/μL, hemoglobin 11.3 g/dL, platelets 233,000/μL, creatinine 1.34 mg/dL, amylase 222 U/L, lipase 174 U/L, lactates 6.5 mmol/L, and HIV viral load 2,330,220 copies/mL. CT scans show pneumoperitoneum, peritonitis, diffuse parietal thickening of the jejunum, and splenic infarction. The patient experienced a cardiorespiratory arrest requiring advanced life support, orotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. A: The patient is diagnosed with severe HIV infection with complications including opportunistic infections and possible sepsis indicated by elevated inflammatory markers and organ dysfunction. The CT findings suggest acute abdominal pathology requiring surgical intervention. Differential diagnoses include HIV-associated opportunistic infections and gastrointestinal malignancy. P: Immediate management includes exploratory laparotomy to address acute abdominal findings. Continue antiretroviral therapy for HIV and monitor CD4 count and viral load. Manage acute symptoms with appropriate antimicrobial therapy and supportive care for respiratory and cardiovascular support. Nutritional support and counseling are also recommended given the patient's cachexia. Regular follow-up in the infectious disease clinic will be necessary, with additional consultations from gastroenterology and oncology as needed. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see that you came in for a screening upper endoscopy and have been diagnosed with thoracic superficial esophageal cancer, even though you had no symptoms. Can you tell me a bit about your medical history? Patient: Yes, I have a history of hypertension. I was also found to have a vascular abnormality called DAA as an adult, but I've been asymptomatic. Doctor: I see. Your physical examinations showed no unusual findings. The laboratory examination data, including tumor markers like squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen and carcinoembryonic antigen, were all within normal ranges. Your chest X-ray demonstrated a widening in the upper mediastinal silhouette, reflecting the superior right aortic arch.  Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: An endoscopic examination revealed superficial esophageal cancer located in the left side of the wall in the upper thoracic esophagus and the invasion of the submucosa. A histological examination of biopsy specimens confirmed the presence of squamous cell carcinoma. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: Enhanced computed tomography showed a swollen lymph node in the right upper mediastinum, which was diagnosed as metastatic. However, no distant metastasis was detected. Computed tomography also confirmed the DAA. The right aortic arch was dominant, and the descending aorta was located at the right side of the post-mediastinum, as is common in cases of DAA. Patient: Alright. Doctor: Based on these findings, you've been diagnosed with upper thoracic esophageal cancer of cT1bN1M0 Stage IIB (UICC-TNM 7th) and a DAA. We'll start with neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to a sub-total esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy. The chemotherapy regimen will be 2 courses of 5-FU (800 mg/m2) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2) every 3 weeks. Patient: Okay, and what's the plan after the chemotherapy? Doctor: After the neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we plan to perform a radical subtotal esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection. We'll first perform a cervical procedure in a supine position before the thoracic procedure to identify the bilateral inferior laryngeal nerves and avoid causing them injury or inducing palsy. We also plan to perform upper mediastinal lymph node dissection during this preceding procedure because the DAA is expected to interfere with upper mediastinal dissection. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything. I hope the treatment goes well. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to ensure a successful treatment. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. [/INST] S: The patient, who was asymptomatic, presented for a screening upper endoscopy and was subsequently diagnosed with thoracic superficial esophageal cancer. The patient has a history of hypertension and a vascular abnormality known as DAA (double aortic arch), but has been asymptomatic regarding this condition. O: Physical examination showed no unusual findings. Laboratory tests including tumor markers (squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen) were within normal limits. Chest X-ray indicated a widening in the upper mediastinal silhouette due to the superior right aortic arch. Endoscopic examination revealed superficial esophageal cancer on the left side of the upper thoracic esophagus with submucosal invasion, confirmed as squamous cell carcinoma via histology. Enhanced CT showed a swollen lymph node in the right upper mediastinum, diagnosed as metastatic, but no distant metastasis was detected. CT also confirmed the presence of DAA with a dominant right aortic arch. A: The patient is diagnosed with upper thoracic esophageal cancer, staged as cT1bN1M0 Stage IIB (UICC-TNM 7th edition), with concurrent DAA. The presence of metastatic lymph node involvement is noted, but there is no evidence of distant metastasis. P: The treatment plan includes 2 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU (800 mg/m2) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2) every 3 weeks, followed by a radical subtotal esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection. The surgical approach will be adjusted to accommodate the anatomical challenges posed by the DAA, with a focus on avoiding injury to the bilateral inferior laryngeal nerves during the cervical and thoracic procedures. Upper mediastinal lymph node dissection will also be performed. The patient is advised to maintain regular follow-ups and communicate any concerns or symptoms during the treatment process. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Good morning. I understand you have a past medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. What brings you here today? Patient: Hi, doc. My cardiologist told me to come to the Emergency Department after finding some abnormal electrocardiogram findings on my Holter monitor. Doctor: Oh, I see. When did you have the monitor placed? Patient: Just a couple days ago. I saw my primary doctor for some arm pain and they did an EKG which showed an irregular rhythm. They referred me to the cardiologist, who then placed the monitor. Doctor: Alright. Have you experienced any chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or headaches recently? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. Doctor: Let me take a look at your physical examination findings. Your pulse is 36 beats/min, respiratory rate is 16/minute, blood pressure is 180/70 mmHg, and your percentage oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Your EKG shows new-onset atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response, frequent bradycardia episodes to less than 40 bpm, and left bundle branch block (LBBB). Are you taking any AV nodal blocking agents like beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin? Patient: No, I'm not on any of those medications. Doctor: Your initial labs show normal pH and an unremarkable basic metabolic panel. Your complete blood count is within normal limits for your age and gender. However, your thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is elevated to 74.03 IU/ml, which is above the reference range of 0.39-4.08 IU/ml. Additionally, your free thyroxine (fT4) levels are decreased to 0.53 mg/dl, which is below the normal range of 0.58-1.64 mg/dl. Patient: I've been taking levothyroxine 25 mcg daily for at least three years, always on an empty stomach, one hour before breakfast. Doctor: I see. Your baseline EKG from two years ago showed LBBB with first-degree AV block. Given your current atrial fibrillation and other findings, we need to adjust your treatment plan. You have a CHA2DS2-VASc score of three, which indicates a moderate to high risk of stroke. We're planning to start you on anticoagulation therapy to reduce this risk. Patient: Okay, doc. What should I do moving forward? Doctor: We'll monitor your thyroid levels and adjust your levothyroxine dosage accordingly. Make sure to continue taking it on an empty stomach one hour before breakfast. Follow up with your cardiologist and primary doctor for further evaluation and management of your atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to follow up with them. Doctor: You're welcome. If you experience any chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath, don't hesitate to seek medical attention immediately. Take care and feel better soon. Patient: Thank you, I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism, was referred to the Emergency Department by a cardiologist due to abnormal findings on a Holter monitor, indicating an irregular rhythm initially detected during an EKG for arm pain. The patient denies experiencing chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or headaches. O: Physical examination shows a pulse of 36 bpm, respiratory rate of 16/min, blood pressure of 180/70 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. EKG reveals new-onset atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response, frequent bradycardia episodes to less than 40 bpm, and persistent left bundle branch block (LBBB). Labs indicate an elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level at 74.03 IU/ml (normal range: 0.39-4.08 IU/ml) and a decreased free thyroxine (fT4) level at 0.53 mg/dl (normal range: 0.58-1.64 mg/dl). The patient is on levothyroxine 25 mcg daily. A: The primary diagnosis is new-onset atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response and frequent bradycardia, compounded by poorly controlled hypothyroidism. Differential diagnoses include primary thyroid dysfunction and secondary cardiac effects. The elevated TSH and decreased fT4 suggest inadequate thyroid hormone replacement. The patient's CHA2DS2-VASc score of three indicates a moderate to high risk of stroke. P: Adjust the levothyroxine dosage based on thyroid function tests and continue monitoring thyroid levels. Initiate anticoagulation therapy to reduce stroke risk. Ensure the patient continues taking levothyroxine on an empty stomach one hour before breakfast. Schedule follow-ups with the cardiologist and primary care physician to manage atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Educate the patient to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms like chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath occur. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Well, I've been suffering from RA since 1983, and I've been on various treatments. Doctor: I see. Have you had any other treatments for your RA besides the conventional DMARDs? Patient: Yes, in December 2008, I started taking ADA 40 mg every 2 weeks because the DMARDs weren't working well enough. Doctor: Hmm, I understand. Did you have any tests done before starting ADA treatment? Patient: Yes, I had a positive TST and my doctor had me take INH for 9 months as a precaution. Doctor: Good, that's a standard procedure for RA patients starting ADA therapy. How has the ADA treatment been working for you? Patient: It was effective against my RA, but in February 2010, I developed cellulitis on both legs. Doctor: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Were you able to get treatment for the cellulitis? Patient: Yes, it improved after taking antibiotics, specifically imipenem, and temporarily stopping ADA. Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you had any other issues since then? Patient: In May 2011, I had a slight fever and some blood tests showed elevated serum CRP and continuous elevation of neutrophil CD64. Doctor: I see. Did you undergo any further examination to find the cause of these symptoms? Patient: Yes, they did a chest X-ray and CT scan and found diffuse reticulonodular shadows in the lung fields, suggesting miliary TB. Doctor: That's concerning. Were there any other tests performed to confirm the diagnosis? Patient: They did a sputum PCR test and found acid-fast bacilli in smear preparations from my sputum and gastric juice. The test came back positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Doctor: I understand. Were you transferred to a hospital for further treatment? Patient: Yes, I was transferred to a hospital with a TB ward. Doctor: Did they perform a bronchoscopy to examine your lungs? Patient: Yes, they found noncaseating epithelioid granuloma in the bronchial and alveolar specimens from the bronchoscopy. Doctor: Did they examine the cellulitis-like lesion on your right lower limb as well? Patient: Yes, they did a biopsy and found erythema induratum of Bazin. Doctor: It seems like you have been through a lot. How has your condition been since starting the anti-TB treatment? Patient: My levels of neutrophil CD64 decreased below the cutoff value, and I've seen improvement in my clinical manifestations. Doctor: That's great to hear. I recommend continuing to follow up with your doctors and keeping a close eye on your symptoms. If you notice any changes or worsening of your condition, please don't hesitate to come back for further evaluation. [/INST] S: The patient, who has been suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) since 1983, reports that conventional DMARDs were ineffective, leading to the initiation of ADA (Adalimumab) 40 mg biweekly since December 2008. The patient had a positive Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) and completed 9 months of INH therapy as a precaution before starting ADA. The patient developed cellulitis in both legs in February 2010, which improved with imipenem and temporary cessation of ADA. In May 2011, the patient experienced a slight fever and elevated serum CRP and neutrophil CD64 levels. Subsequent investigations revealed miliary tuberculosis (TB), confirmed by sputum PCR and bronchoscopy, which showed noncaseating epithelioid granuloma. The patient also had erythema induratum of Bazin on the right lower limb. O: The patient's ADA treatment was effective against RA but led to complications including cellulitis and miliary TB. Laboratory tests showed elevated CRP and neutrophil CD64. Imaging and bronchoscopy confirmed miliary TB and noncaseating epithelioid granuloma. Biopsy of the right lower limb lesion confirmed erythema induratum of Bazin. The patient has been treated in a specialized TB ward and has shown clinical improvement with anti-TB treatment. A: Primary diagnosis is miliary tuberculosis secondary to immunosuppression from ADA therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Differential diagnoses included complications from RA and ADA therapy, such as cellulitis and erythema induratum of Bazin. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic with ongoing anti-TB treatment and monitoring. P: Continue anti-TB treatment and regular monitoring of TB symptoms and RA activity. Follow up with rheumatology for RA management and adjust immunosuppressive therapy as needed to balance control of RA symptoms with risk of opportunistic infections. Educate the patient on signs of potential complications, including worsening of respiratory symptoms or skin lesions. Ensure adherence to treatment and follow-up appointments with both rheumatology and infectious disease specialists. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me your medical history? Have you had any issues with tobacco abuse or depression? Patient: Yes, I have a history of tobacco abuse and depression. Doctor: I see. What brought you to the hospital today? Patient: I've been feeling really tired for the past three weeks, and I've been coughing up blood-tinged sputum for the past two days. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll conduct a physical examination. *After examination* I noticed decreased breath sounds on your right lung base, but your oral cavity looks normal with no cervical lymphadenopathy. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: We've done an initial laboratory evaluation, and it came back normal. There was no leukocytosis, and your blood cultures were negative. Your Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) test was also non-reactive. Patient: That's good to hear. Doctor: However, your chest radiograph revealed a large, lower, right-sided loculated effusion. We performed an ultrasound-guided chest tube placement, which yielded 200 ml of exudative fluid with 34,300/mm3 nucleated white blood cells and 1372/mm3 granulocytes. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: That means there's an infection in your lung. We sent the pleural fluid for laboratory analysis and started you on intravenous ampicillin/sulbactam. The pleural fluid culture showed a rare species, S. gordonii, causing the infection. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: During your stay at the hospital, we noticed you have mild dysphagia with your regular diet. Aspiration may be the reason for your infection. Patient: So, what's next? Doctor: We did a repeat chest X-ray, which showed worsening empyema. We administered tPA in the chest tube, which yielded 550 cc of exudative fluid. A follow-up CT of your chest revealed loculated effusions. Patient: Is there anything else we can do? Doctor: Unfortunately, the chest tube drainage with tPA and antibiotics didn't improve the loculated effusions. We're going to transfer you to a more advanced center for video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) decortication. Patient: Alright, I hope that helps. Thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, a known smoker with a history of depression, reports experiencing significant fatigue for the past three weeks and coughing up blood-tinged sputum for the past two days. He also mentions mild dysphagia with his regular diet. O: Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the right lung base. Initial labs including leukocyte count and blood cultures were normal. HIV test was non-reactive. Chest radiograph and subsequent CT showed a large, right-sided loculated effusion. Ultrasound-guided chest tube placement extracted 200 ml of exudative fluid with high levels of nucleated white cells and granulocytes. Pleural fluid culture isolated S. gordonii. Repeat chest X-ray indicated worsening empyema despite treatment with intravenous ampicillin/sulbactam and tPA administration through the chest tube, which yielded 550 cc of exudative fluid. A: The primary diagnosis is empyema secondary to aspiration, likely exacerbated by the patient's history of tobacco use and dysphagia. The identification of S. gordonii in the pleural fluid is notable, as this is a rare causative agent. The lack of response to conservative management including antibiotics and chest tube drainage with tPA suggests a complicated course. P: The patient will be transferred to a specialized center for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) decortication to address the loculated effusions. Continuation of antibiotic therapy tailored to the culture results is recommended. Nutritional assessment and modification of diet to manage dysphagia, along with smoking cessation counseling, are also advised to prevent recurrence and improve overall lung health. Follow-up after surgery will be necessary to monitor recovery and manage any residual complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I understand that your child recently underwent corrective surgery for developmental dysplasia of the hip. How is he feeling now? Patient's parent: Hi, Dr. Smith. He seems to be doing better now, but we had a scary situation after the surgery. Doctor: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you please tell me what happened after the surgery? Patient's parent: Well, when they were plastering his limbs in the operation theater, he suddenly started having a high temperature, like 106.6°F, and then his heart started beating really fast. Doctor: I see. That sounds like tachycardia. Did he have any other symptoms? Patient's parent: Yes, he was breathing very fast, had convulsions, and his muscles became very stiff. Doctor: That must have been frightening. It sounds like tachypnea and muscular rigidity were also present. What happened next? Patient's parent: They quickly shifted him to the PICU and put him on mechanical ventilation. They also started some emergency supportive management. Doctor: Those were the right steps to take. Now, I have the test results here, and it shows that his serum CPK was 15,200 U/L. He also had hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.15, PCO2 of 60 mm Hg, and HCO3 of 11 mEq/L. Did the medical team take any measures to address these issues? Patient's parent: Yes, they started hyperhydration and rapidly corrected his electrolyte and acid-base balance. Doctor: That's good to hear. Did they do anything else to help lower his temperature? Patient's parent: Yeah, they started whole body cooling with ice packs and cold saline infusion. Doctor: That was a very effective approach. How long was your child on mechanical ventilation? Patient's parent: He was on it for 48 hours, and then they extubated him. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that he responded well to the treatment and is now off mechanical ventilation. It's important to keep a close eye on him and follow up with his pediatrician to monitor his recovery. If you notice any concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare team. Patient's parent: Thank you, Dr. Smith. We'll definitely keep a close eye on him and follow up with his pediatrician. We appreciate your guidance and support. [/INST] S: The patient, a child, recently underwent corrective surgery for developmental dysplasia of the hip. Post-surgery, the patient experienced a high fever of 106.6°F, tachycardia, tachypnea, convulsions, and muscular rigidity. The symptoms prompted an emergency transfer to the PICU and initiation of mechanical ventilation and supportive management. O: Objective findings include a serum CPK level of 15,200 U/L (normal range: 39-308 U/L), hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis characterized by a pH of 7.15, PCO2 of 60 mm Hg, and HCO3 of 11 mEq/L. The patient was treated with hyperhydration, electrolyte and acid-base balance correction, whole body cooling using ice packs and cold saline infusion, and was mechanically ventilated for 48 hours before successful extubation. A: The primary diagnosis is malignant hyperthermia, suggested by the acute onset of hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, elevated CPK, and associated metabolic disturbances following anesthesia. Differential diagnoses could include sepsis or other metabolic disorders, but the clinical context and rapid response to specific interventions support malignant hyperthermia as the most likely diagnosis. P: Continue close monitoring in the PICU with regular assessments of vital signs, electrolyte levels, and muscle function. Follow up with the pediatrician for ongoing care and monitoring of hip development post-surgery. Educate the parents about the signs of malignant hyperthermia and the importance of informing healthcare providers about this susceptibility in future surgeries or medical procedures. Ensure all medical records are updated with this diagnosis to alert future healthcare providers. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that you are a 55-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease of unknown cause. Can you tell me about your experience with hemodialysis? Patient: Yeah, I have been undergoing hemodialysis for the past 4 years. Doctor: I see. Now, you received a living-related renal transplant from your husband in September 2014, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Before the transplantation, we performed a computed tomography (CT) scan which revealed moderate to severe atherosclerosis of the bilateral iliac arteries. Did you know about this? Patient: Yes, I was informed about that. Doctor: And we also found that the donor's CT revealed two left renal arteries. Your blood type is compatible, but you had donor-specific antibody-positive. So, we performed desensitization before transplantation with three sessions of double filtration plasmapheresis or plasma exchange and two doses of rituximab (100 mg). Were you aware of this? Patient: Yes, I remember going through that process. Doctor: Good. For your immunosuppressive agents, we included triple immunosuppressive therapy with extended-release tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and methylprednisolone. Are you still taking these medications? Patient: Yes, I am. Doctor: During the transplant, we made the transplant bed in the right iliac fossa. There were two donor renal arteries, the main artery and one narrow artery. To extend the length of the narrow artery, we used the donor's gonadal vein graft with end-to-end anastomosis using a 6-0 monofilament at the back table. Were you aware of this? Patient: I think I heard something about that, but I didn't quite understand it. Doctor: That's okay. Usually, when there are two donor renal arteries, we connect the two arteries conjointly or side-to-end at the back table. However, due to the short length and large distance between the two arteries, we decided to intracorporeally anastomose each renal artery to the iliac artery to avoid anastomotic stenosis. The transplanted renal vein was anastomosed to the right external iliac vein side-to-end using a 5-0 monofilament with continuous sutures. Patient: Okay, I see. Doctor: First, considering the position of the two arteries, we decided to anastomose the extended artery to the right external iliac artery side-to-end using a 6-0 monofilament with continuous sutures. Second, before anastomosing the main artery to the iliac artery, we punched out the external iliac artery using an aorta. Patient: Alright, I understand better now. Doctor: Great. It's important to keep up with your follow-up appointments and continue taking your immunosuppressive medications as prescribed. Do you have any questions or concerns? Patient: No, I think I understand everything now. Thank you for explaining it to me. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care! Patient: Thank you, doctor! [/INST] S: The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease of unknown etiology, who has been on hemodialysis for the past 4 years. She underwent a living-related renal transplant from her husband in September 2014. She reports being informed about her moderate to severe atherosclerosis of the bilateral iliac arteries and the desensitization process pre-transplant, which included three sessions of double filtration plasmapheresis and two doses of rituximab (100 mg). She confirms ongoing adherence to her triple immunosuppressive therapy regimen, which includes extended-release tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and methylprednisolone. O: Pre-transplant imaging (CT) showed moderate to severe atherosclerosis of the bilateral iliac arteries. The donor's CT scan revealed two left renal arteries. Surgical notes indicate the transplant bed was made in the right iliac fossa with complex vascular reconstruction using the donor's gonadal vein graft for the narrow artery and end-to-end anastomosis. The main renal artery and the extended artery were anastomosed to the right external iliac artery. The renal vein was anastomosed to the right external iliac vein. A: The patient is currently stable post renal transplantation with a history of complex vascular anatomy requiring specialized surgical techniques to prevent anastomotic stenosis. The ongoing use of immunosuppressive therapy is critical for the graft's longevity. The patient's understanding of her medical condition and treatment appears adequate. P: Continue current immunosuppressive medications without changes. Monitor renal function and signs of rejection periodically. Ensure patient adherence to follow-up appointments for continuous evaluation and management of her transplant status. Educate the patient about signs of infection or graft rejection. No additional referrals indicated at this time. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've been admitted due to tremors in your head, neck, and upper limbs, as well as a moderate tremor in your lower limbs. Can you tell me when you first started experiencing these symptoms? Patient: Yes, the initial symptoms appeared about 20 years ago. It was primarily a kinetic tremor in my left upper and lower limbs. Doctor: I see. During the neurological examination, it was noted that you presented with dysarthria, paresis of the right facial nerve, brisk reflexes on the right side, bilateral dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis, truncal ataxia, and ataxia of the lower limbs, which was more prominent on the left side. You also had an unstable gait. Did you notice any of these issues before? Patient: Yeah, I've been struggling with some of those problems for a while now. Doctor: A psychological examination also revealed mild cognitive impairment and deficits in executive functions. Were you aware of these issues? Patient: I've noticed some trouble with my memory and thinking, but I wasn't sure what it was. Doctor: Your combination of intention tremor, ataxia, the MCP sign, and gait instability led us to suspect FXTAS. We performed an extended molecular examination using the Amplide X FMR1 PCR kit, which revealed permutations in the FMR1 gene (between 60 and 85 ± 5 repeats of CGG). This confirmed the diagnosis of FXTAS with the expansion of CGG repeats in your FMR1 gene. Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for me? Doctor: Well, we tried pharmacological treatments such as primidone and propranolol to treat your tremors, but they didn't have sufficient effects. So, we performed a radiosurgical thalamotomy using the GK on the VIM of your left thalamus. Patient: How did you do that? Doctor: We attached the Leksell Model G stereotactic coordinate frame to your head and acquired high-resolution MRI images using a 1.5T scanner. Contrast-enhanced T1 and T2 images were taken at 1 mm intervals. We identified the anterior commissure (AC), the posterior commissure (PC), and the third ventricle on these images. Patient: And then what happened? Doctor: Stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy was performed using the Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion model. This procedure aimed to alleviate your tremors and improve your quality of life. Patient: Thank you, doctor. What should I do for follow-up care? Doctor: We will monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. It's important to continue attending regular check-ups and report any changes in your symptoms or any new concerns. Patient: Okay, I'll make sure to do that. Thanks for your help, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help. [/INST] S: The patient, with a 20-year history of kinetic tremors initially in the left upper and lower limbs, now presents with head, neck, and upper limb tremors, and moderate tremors in the lower limbs. The patient also reports dysarthria, right facial nerve paresis, bilateral dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis, truncal ataxia, and an unstable gait, which have been progressively worsening. Additionally, the patient has noticed mild cognitive impairments and deficits in executive functions. O: Neurological examination revealed dysarthria, right facial nerve paresis, brisk reflexes on the right side, bilateral dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis, truncal ataxia, and ataxia of the lower limbs, more prominent on the left side. Psychological examination indicated mild cognitive impairment and deficits in executive functions. Molecular examination using the Amplide X FMR1 PCR kit showed permutations in the FMR1 gene (60 to 85 ± 5 repeats of CGG), confirming the diagnosis of FXTAS. Radiosurgical thalamotomy was performed using the Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion model, targeting the VIM of the left thalamus after stereotactic placement and MRI imaging. A: The primary diagnosis is Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), confirmed by genetic testing and clinical presentation. The patient's symptoms of tremor, ataxia, and cognitive impairment are consistent with this diagnosis. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of tremor and ataxia but are less likely given the genetic findings and specific symptomatology. P: The patient underwent radiosurgical thalamotomy, which aims to reduce tremor severity. Follow-up care will include regular monitoring of symptom progression and cognitive function. Adjustments to the treatment plan will be made as necessary based on the patient's response to the thalamotomy and any new symptoms. The patient is advised to maintain regular check-ups and report any new concerns or changes in symptoms. Further pharmacological treatment options may be considered if symptoms persist or worsen. </s>"

How can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've had abdominal pain and vomiting for the past two days. Doctor: I see. Have you had any issues with constipation? Patient: Yeah, I've been chronically constipated since I was 15 years old. I only have one or two bowel movements per month and I don't use laxatives. Doctor: Okay, let's do a quick check-up. On admission, I noticed that you're afebrile, tachycardic with a heart rate of 148 beats per minute, hypotensive with a blood pressure of 89/55 mmHg, and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 36/min. You also appear cachectic with severe muscle wasting and dry mucous membranes. Your body mass index (BMI) is 14.8 kg/m2.  Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Let's continue with the physical exam. I noticed that your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and distended, with no guarding and rigidity. You also have hypoactive bowel sounds and chronic muscle contractions in your extremities.  Patient: Hmm, yes, I feel that too. Doctor: We also ran some laboratory tests. Your leukocytosis is 20300/µL with a left shift (bands 22), which is quite elevated. Your hemoglobin is 16.4 g/dL and your hematocrit is 51.1%, both within the normal range. Your blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 31 mg/dL, which is elevated, while your creatinine is 0.40 mg/dL, which is low. There's a mild elevation in your aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 54 IU/L. Your prothrombin time (PT) is 14s, international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.3, and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is 32.3. Lastly, your albumin level is normal at 4.7 g/dL. Patient: So, what does all that mean? Doctor: It means that you're severely intravascular volume-depleted, as indicated by your physical exam and laboratory values. We'll need to start you on aggressive fluid resuscitation with Ringer's lactate to address this issue. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. What should I do next? Doctor: You should continue to monitor your symptoms and follow up with your primary care physician. If your abdominal pain or vomiting worsens or if you develop any new concerning symptoms, please come back to the hospital immediately. Patient: Got it. Thank you so much for your help, Doctor. I'll follow your advice. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care and feel better soon!

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see that you've been admitted to the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Can you tell me about the complaints you have? Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling down lately. I don't enjoy doing things I used to, I have trouble sleeping, and I've been having suicidal thoughts. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Anything else you're experiencing? Patient: I've been binge eating and then making myself throw up. I also exercise a lot, which made me lose a lot of weight. Doctor: That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about your family situation? I heard there's been some conflict. Patient: I live with my mom and sister. I'm really unhappy because my mom forces me to talk to my dad. He left us 9 years ago and I haven't talked to him since. Now he's calling every day trying to start a new relationship with us. Doctor: That does sound difficult. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior since this started? Patient: Yeah, I've been taking money from home without permission, especially after my dad calls. And I've been fighting with my friends and siblings. Doctor: I see. I understand you were admitted to the paediatric inpatient clinics before coming here. Did you have any complaints of dysphagia, retrosternal pain, or heartburn? Patient: No, I didn't have any of those symptoms. Doctor: Good to know. Your physical examinations, blood tests, abdominal-pelvic ultrasound, and endoscopy were all normal on both paediatric occasions. The paediatric gastroenterology specialist reported that your condition isn't associated with any primary oesophageal motility disorders like achalasia, diffuse oesophageal spasm, nutcracker oesophagus, etc., or secondary oesophageal motility disorders like diabetes mellitus or scleroderma. That's why you were referred here for a psychiatric evaluation. Patient: Oh, okay. Doctor: During your psychiatric evaluation, you mentioned not being afraid of gaining weight, but your self-esteem is strongly affected by your physical appearance. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. I'm really unhappy with how I look. Doctor: Thank you for sharing all this information. It will help us better understand your situation and provide the appropriate support and treatment. We will work closely with you to address your concerns and help you cope with the challenges you're facing. [/INST] S: The patient, a child in the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, reports feeling persistently down, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, and insomnia. The patient also experiences suicidal ideation, binge eating followed by self-induced vomiting, and excessive exercise leading to significant weight loss. The patient expresses distress related to familial conflicts, particularly forced interactions with an estranged father, which have coincided with behavioral changes including stealing money and increased aggression towards peers and family. No symptoms of dysphagia, retrosternal pain, or heartburn were reported. O: Physical examinations, blood tests, abdominal-pelvic ultrasound, and endoscopy results were normal. No primary or secondary oesophageal motility disorders were identified by the paediatric gastroenterology specialist. Psychiatric evaluation noted the patient's self-esteem is significantly influenced by physical appearance, without a specific fear of weight gain. A: Primary diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, considering the significant mood symptoms, anhedonia, and suicidal thoughts. Differential diagnoses include Bulimia Nervosa due to binge-purge behavior and excessive concern with body image. The patient's stealing and aggression suggest possible conduct disorder traits. The absence of gastrointestinal symptoms after thorough evaluation rules out related physical health issues. P: Initiate a treatment plan including antidepressant medication and cognitive-behavioral therapy focusing on mood stabilization and coping strategies for stress and body image concerns. Regular psychiatric follow-ups and monitoring of medication effects and side effects are recommended. Engage a family therapist to address interpersonal conflicts and improve familial support dynamics. Nutritional counseling and monitoring of eating patterns will be beneficial. Educate the patient and family about the importance of adherence to the treatment plan and the potential complications of untreated psychiatric conditions. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you have a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and stroke. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been experiencing muscle weakness for the past two months. I also had a remote exposure to statins. Doctor: Okay, let's do a physical examination first. Hmm, it appears that you have 2/5 strength on the left side and 4/5 on the right. We need to run some tests to better understand your condition.  Patient: Alright, doctor. Doctor: The test results show that your CK level is extremely high at 28,885 U/L, which leads me to suspect necrotizing myositis. We'll start by treating you with IV methylprednisolone followed by PDN 60 mg/day.  Patient: Okay, doctor. Doctor: We also did an MRI which showed extensive proximal muscle edema. Additionally, a biopsy of your vastus medialis showed necrotizing features without inflammation. Your Hydroxy-Methyl-Glutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG CoA) antibodies were strongly positive. Patient: I see. Doctor: One month after presentation, there was a modest improvement in your motor weakness, and your CK levels dropped to 5,546 U/L. We then gave you IVIG for 5 days, and started you on MMF 1 g/day. However, your weakness continued, and your CK levels remained elevated. Patient: Oh, that's concerning. Doctor: Yes, it is. Two months after presentation, we added rituximab to your regimen of MMF (3 g/day) and prednisone (60 mg/day). We also gave you two doses of IVIG as bridge therapy. After an initial response, your muscle weakness returned. Patient: Oh no... Doctor: Three months after presentation, your CK levels were still elevated at 3,178 U/L. We then added TAC 4 mg/day to your MMF (3 g/day) and PDN 40 mg/day regimen. On follow-up visits, we increased your TAC dose to 6 mg/day, and slowly tapered your PDN dose. Patient: Did that help? Doctor: Yes, eight months after TAC was initiated, your weakness improved markedly, and your labs normalized. Your CK level dropped to 117 U/L, and your LDH level was 251 U/L. Patient: That's great news! Doctor: Indeed! One year after starting tacrolimus and MMF, your physical exam was normal, with full strength throughout. Your PDN dose had been reduced to 5 mg daily. Patient: Wow, thank you so much, doctor! I feel so much better now. Doctor: You're welcome! It's important to continue monitoring your condition and follow up with your appointments. If you have any concerns in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and stroke, presents with a chief complaint of muscle weakness for the past two months. The patient also reported a remote exposure to statins. O: Physical examination revealed muscle strength of 2/5 on the left side and 4/5 on the right. Laboratory tests showed an extremely high creatine kinase (CK) level at 28,885 U/L (normal range: 22-198 U/L). MRI indicated extensive proximal muscle edema. Muscle biopsy of the vastus medialis displayed necrotizing features without inflammation. Hydroxy-Methyl-Glutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG CoA) antibodies were strongly positive. Follow-up over several months showed fluctuating CK levels with a peak at 28,885 U/L and a decrease to 117 U/L after treatment. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was 251 U/L (normal range: 135-225 U/L). A: The primary diagnosis is necrotizing myositis, likely statin-induced given the history and strong positivity for HMG CoA antibodies. The differential diagnosis initially included other forms of myositis, but biopsy results supported the primary diagnosis. The patient's condition showed a response to immunosuppressive therapy, although with some fluctuations in muscle strength and CK levels. P: Initiated treatment with IV methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone (PDN) 60 mg/day. Added mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1 g/day and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Due to persistent symptoms and elevated CK levels, rituximab and increased doses of MMF (3 g/day) and PDN were introduced. Tacrolimus (TAC) was added later, starting at 4 mg/day and increased to 6 mg/day, with a gradual tapering of PDN to 5 mg/day. The patient showed marked improvement after eight months of TAC treatment. Continued monitoring and regular follow-up appointments are recommended to manage and adjust the treatment regimen as needed. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, I see that you were admitted to our hospital in March 2017 for a liver resection to treat a malignant hepatic lesion. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right, doc. Doctor: It looks like this hepatic lesion was diagnosed through CT and PET scans, and a fine-needle biopsy came back positive for squamous carcinoma. Do you recall any symptoms that led to these tests? Patient: Well, they found the hepatic tumor during a follow-up for my bladder cancer. I had endoscopic surgery for that three years ago. Doctor: I see. The hepatic tumor measured 22 mm in diameter and was located in the VIII Couinaud's segment of the liver. There were also three smaller hypodense liver lesions and a focal dilatation of the peripheral biliary tree. Our team of radiologists, oncologists, and pathologists discussed your case extensively. Even if the lesion had been the single site of disease, due to the proximity and doubtful infiltration of the lesion to the biliary tree, we decided to submit you to an explorative staging laparotomy and possible palliative surgery. Does that sound familiar? Patient: Yes, I remember that. Doctor: Our internal protocol states that during the preadmission, every patient who is a candidate for a liver resection is subjected to a routine liver function test with ICG to determine the most appropriate surgical procedures. In your case, 45 mg of ICG was intravenously administered to test hepatic function ten days before the surgery. Your ICG retention rate at 15 minutes (R15) was 8.9.  Patient: Okay, I remember that test. Doctor: The ICG has a unique property of being fluorescent with the light emitted from the photodynamic eye of the laparoscopic system, allowing us to visualize the lesion during the surgical procedure. The timing of administration and dose of ICG are key points in this process. Patient: I see. Doctor: Studies have demonstrated that the effective dose of ICG depends on the timing of the injection. Specifically, if the liver function test had been performed more than 7 days before surgery, it would have been necessary to administer an adjunctive dose (0.1 mg/kg) the day before. In your case, we needed to administer an additional dose of ICG the day before your surgery. Patient: Oh, I remember getting that extra dose. Doctor: Good. Now that we've covered your previous treatment, let's discuss your follow-up requirements and any concerns you may have. Patient: Sure, doc. Thanks for explaining everything to me. [/INST] S: The patient was previously admitted for a liver resection in March 2017 due to a malignant hepatic lesion, initially identified during follow-up for bladder cancer treated three years prior with endoscopic surgery. The patient recalls undergoing various diagnostic tests, including CT, PET scans, and a fine-needle biopsy, which confirmed squamous carcinoma. Symptoms leading to these tests were not specified but were related to routine follow-up for previous bladder cancer. O: The hepatic tumor was 22 mm in diameter, located in the VIII Couinaud's segment of the liver, with additional findings of three smaller hypodense liver lesions and focal dilatation of the peripheral biliary tree. Pre-surgical assessment included a liver function test using 45 mg of intravenous ICG, with an ICG retention rate at 15 minutes (R15) of 8.9, indicating adequate liver function. An additional dose of ICG was administered the day before surgery due to the timing of the initial dose. A: Primary diagnosis was squamous carcinoma of the liver, with a history of bladder cancer. The hepatic lesion's proximity to the biliary tree raised concerns about possible infiltration, leading to explorative staging laparotomy and palliative surgery. Differential diagnoses included potential metastasis from previously treated bladder cancer. P: The patient will continue with routine follow-up to monitor for recurrence or progression of hepatic or bladder cancer. Further management includes regular imaging studies and liver function tests to assess the status of the liver and any new lesions. Education on symptoms of liver dysfunction and when to seek immediate care will be provided. Referral to oncology for ongoing cancer surveillance and management is planned. Compliance with follow-up appointments and medication adherence will be emphasized during each visit. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, you mentioned that you've been experiencing a dry cough and fevers for the past 5 weeks. Have you taken any medications for this? Patient: Yes, I've taken two courses of oral antibiotics, but they didn't seem to help. Doctor: I see. Do you have any history of joint pain or other medical issues? Patient: I've had unclassified arthralgia for about 10 years. Doctor: Alright, thank you for sharing that. We've done some tests, and your creatinine level is quite high at 682 μmol/L. Your Urinalysis also showed 3+ blood and protein. We did a urine microscopy which revealed granular casts and more than 200 red cells per cubic millimeter. Your urinary protein to creatinine ratio is 133 mg/mmol.  Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Additionally, your physical examination was unremarkable, but your blood pressure was quite high at 186/74 upon admission. We also found a positive MPO-ANCA titre of 60 IU/ml and a positive anti-GBM titre of 33 IU/ml. Patient: What does that mean, exactly? Doctor: These results indicate that you have an autoimmune condition affecting your kidneys. Your complement levels, however, are normal. We performed a renal biopsy which revealed crescentic glomerulonephritis in 80% of your glomeruli. We didn't find any glomerular deposition of immunoglobulin or complement in the formalin fixed tissue sample. Patient: So, what's the plan for treatment? Doctor: We've started you on plasma exchange, pulsed methylprednisolone, followed by oral prednisolone and six pulses of intravenous cyclophosphamide. For maintenance therapy, we will give you a reducing course of prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil, as you're intolerant to azathioprine. Patient: How long will I be on these medications? Doctor: We will monitor your progress closely. At 21 months of follow-up, your serum creatinine level has improved to 127 μmol/L, and both your MPO-ANCA and anti-GBM titres are negative. We'll adjust your medications as needed during follow-up appointments. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll keep a close eye on your condition and make sure you're on the right track to recovery. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to reach out. [/INST] S: The patient reports a persistent dry cough and fevers for the past 5 weeks, unresponsive to two courses of oral antibiotics. The patient has a history of unclassified arthralgia for approximately 10 years. O: Physical examination was unremarkable except for elevated blood pressure at 186/74 mmHg. Laboratory findings include a high creatinine level of 682 μmol/L (normal range: 45-90 μmol/L), urinalysis showing 3+ blood and protein, urine microscopy revealing granular casts and >200 red cells per cubic millimeter, and a urinary protein to creatinine ratio of 133 mg/mmol. Positive MPO-ANCA titre of 60 IU/ml and anti-GBM titre of 33 IU/ml were noted. Renal biopsy showed crescentic glomerulonephritis in 80% of glomeruli without immunoglobulin or complement deposition. Complement levels were normal. A: The primary diagnosis is crescentic glomerulonephritis with a likely underlying autoimmune etiology, as suggested by the positive MPO-ANCA and anti-GBM titres. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the response to treatment, with significant improvement in renal function over 21 months. P: Treatment initiated with plasma exchange and pulsed methylprednisolone, followed by oral prednisolone and six pulses of intravenous cyclophosphamide. Maintenance therapy includes a reducing course of prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil due to intolerance to azathioprine. Close monitoring of renal function and autoimmune markers will continue, with medication adjustments as necessary during follow-up appointments. The patient is advised to maintain regular follow-up and report any new symptoms or concerns. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello. I understand you've been admitted to the Infectious Disease Clinic due to suspected HFRS and dehydration. Can you tell me about your symptoms and when they started? Patient: Hi, doc. About two weeks ago, I was cleaning out a cabin and got exposed to bank voles. Six days after that, I started feeling ill with fever, chills, weakness, and had difficulties eating and drinking. My urine production also decreased. Doctor: I see. We ran some tests and found positive serology for Puumala virus, which confirms the HFRS diagnosis. Your laboratory tests taken the day before admission revealed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 48 × 10^9/L, impaired renal function with a creatinine level of 278 μmol/L, and leucocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14 × 10^9/L. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. Doctor: Upon admission to the hospital, your platelet count had increased to 61 × 10^9/L and creatinine increased to 370 μmol/L, indicating clinical progression to the oliguric stage of HFRS. However, your platelet levels decreased to 12 × 10^9/L on days 8 to 9. Due to the high risk of spontaneous bleeding, we decided to transfuse platelets on days 8, 9, and 10. Patient: Yes, I remember those transfusions. Doctor: Despite the transfusions with three platelet units, you remained severely thrombocytopenic with platelet counts below 50 × 10^9/L during days 8 to 13. You also fulfilled the criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) from day 8. Patient: That's concerning. Doctor: On day 13, after your last platelet transfusion and a platelet count of 27 × 10^9/L, you experienced abdominal pain that increased in severity during the evening. We performed an abdominal computed tomography (CT) which showed congestion and ischemia in the terminal ileum due to a thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) reaching up to the portal vein (PV). Patient: Oh no, what does that mean? Doctor: The hematologist advised against thrombolysis, which is a treatment to dissolve blood clots, due to your thrombocytopenia in combination with a known mild VHF. We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide the necessary treatments to manage your symptoms and prevent complications. Patient: I see. Thank you for explaining everything to me. What should I do now? Doctor: For now, it's important that you stay hydrated, follow the prescribed medication regimen, and report any new or worsening symptoms to your healthcare team. We will continue to closely monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan as needed. Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, recently admitted to the Infectious Disease Clinic, reports symptoms starting approximately two weeks ago after exposure to bank voles, including fever, chills, weakness, decreased appetite, and reduced urine output. Symptoms began six days post-exposure. O: Initial laboratory tests revealed thrombocytopenia (platelet count 48 × 10^9/L), impaired renal function (creatinine 278 μmol/L), and leucocytosis (white blood cell count 14 × 10^9/L). Subsequent tests showed worsening thrombocytopenia and renal function (platelet count 61 × 10^9/L, creatinine 370 μmol/L). Platelet transfusions were administered on days 8, 9, and 10 due to severe thrombocytopenia and criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) were met. Abdominal CT on day 13 revealed congestion and ischemia in the terminal ileum with a thrombus extending from the superior mesenteric vein to the portal vein. A: The primary diagnosis is Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) due to Puumala virus infection, confirmed by positive serology. Complications include severe thrombocytopenia, DIC, and thrombosis in the superior mesenteric and portal veins. Differential diagnosis includes other viral hemorrhagic fevers, but these are less likely given the serology results and exposure history. P: Continue close monitoring of the patient's hematologic and renal parameters. Maintain hydration and adhere to the prescribed medication regimen. Avoid thrombolysis due to the risk of bleeding from severe thrombocytopenia. Regular follow-ups with the healthcare team are essential to adjust treatment plans based on the patient's evolving condition. Educate the patient on the importance of reporting new or worsening symptoms immediately. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I'm a 57-year-old retired male and I came here in 2019 because I found a mass in my left breast. Doctor: I see. Are you a smoker? Patient: No, I'm a non-smoker. I do have a history of grade (I) LP in my right thigh root 14 years ago, which was treated surgically along with radiotherapy of the right thigh. I haven't had any signs of recurrence since then. I also have well-controlled diabetes. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. When you presented here, did we perform a physical examination on your left breast mass? Patient: Yes, you did. The examination showed a suspicious abnormality on Ultrasound that measured 32 mm. Doctor: And did we also perform a computed tomography scan (CT)? Patient: Yes, the CT showed left breast infiltration with no signs of metastases. Doctor: Alright. After that, you underwent an excisional biopsy which revealed a poorly differentiated grade III invasive ductal carcinoma. Consequently, you underwent a mastectomy in 2019 with axillary node resection. The final diagnosis based on the histological findings was invasive ductal carcinoma stage IIA [T:2, N:0, M:0]. Do you remember the results of the hormonal receptors tests? Patient: Yes, the tests showed that I had a positive Estrogen Receptor (ER+), negative Progesterone Receptor (PR-), and negative Human Epidermal Receptor (HER-). Doctor: That's correct. You then received eight cycles of chemotherapy with Docetaxel and 16 sessions of radiation to the chest wall, with the last session being on the fourth of October 2020. How have you been since then? Patient: I've been doing okay, I think. Doctor: Good to hear. We conducted a positron emission tomography (PET) scan six months after your surgery, which showed no signs of recurrence. It's essential to continue monitoring your health and attend regular follow-up appointments to ensure there are no changes. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to keep up with my appointments and let you know if I notice any changes in my health. [/INST] S: The patient is a 57-year-old retired male, non-smoker, with a history of grade I liposarcoma in the right thigh root treated with surgery and radiotherapy 14 years ago, and well-controlled diabetes. He initially presented in 2019 with a mass in his left breast. He reports no signs of recurrence of liposarcoma and has been feeling okay since his last treatment. O: Physical examination and ultrasound in 2019 revealed a 32 mm suspicious abnormality in the left breast. CT scan showed left breast infiltration without metastases. Excisional biopsy confirmed poorly differentiated grade III invasive ductal carcinoma. He underwent a mastectomy with axillary node resection, and histological findings confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma stage IIA (T2, N0, M0). Hormonal receptor tests were positive for Estrogen Receptor (ER+), negative for Progesterone Receptor (PR-), and Human Epidermal Receptor (HER-). He completed eight cycles of chemotherapy with Docetaxel and 16 radiation sessions to the chest wall, ending in October 2020. A follow-up PET scan six months post-surgery showed no signs of recurrence. A: The primary diagnosis is stage IIA invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, ER+, PR-, HER-. The patient has completed treatment and currently shows no signs of recurrence. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic, contingent on regular monitoring and early detection of any potential recurrence. P: The patient should continue regular follow-up appointments to monitor for recurrence of breast cancer. He should report any new symptoms or changes in his health immediately. Continued adherence to diabetes management is recommended. Further education on signs of recurrence and lifestyle modifications to reduce cancer risk should be provided. Referral to a support group for cancer survivors may be beneficial for psychological support. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you were referred to our surgical outpatient department due to a 2-month history of altered bowel habit. Can you describe your symptoms in more detail? Patient: Yeah, my bowel movements have been irregular lately, and I've been experiencing some discomfort. Doctor: I understand. We conducted an abdominal examination and a digital rectal examination, both of which were unremarkable. We also performed laboratory studies, including a full blood count and biochemistry, which came back normal. However, a colonoscopy study identified four abnormal lesions. Two of them were colonic subcentimetre polyps. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Don't worry too much yet. More distally in the mid-rectum, at 15 cm from the anal verge, there was a sizeable, villous polypoidal lesion. The biopsy showed it to be a tubulovillous adenoma (TVA) with low-grade dysplasia. It's not cancerous, but it could explain your symptoms. Patient: Hmm, what about the other lesion? Doctor: The other lesion was more proximal in the distal sigmoid colon at 25 cm. It appeared to be malignant-looking with a stricture. However, biopsy samples showed hyperplastic colonic mucosa with lamina propria fibrosis and mild chronic active inflammation. There were also separate pieces of granulation tissue and ulcer slough, but no evidence of malignancy. Patient: So, it's not cancerous either? Doctor: As per our local protocol for malignant-appearing lesions on endoscopy, we arranged a staging CT scan based on the colonoscopy appearances to facilitate the cancer pathway. The CT scan demonstrated, at the site of the presumed malignancy in the distal sigmoid colon, a 7 cm segment of circumferential thickening on a background of diverticulosis. There were also a few subcentimetre locoregional and inferior mesenteric lymph nodes. No other signs of malignancy were found, so the proposed CT staging was T2/3 N1 M0. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: Although the 5 cm rectal TVA could explain your symptoms, our multidisciplinary team discussed your case and concluded that either lesion could be responsible for your symptoms. Despite the lack of malignant cells in the biopsy samples, the surgical team is still concerned about a potential sigmoid colon malignancy based on the endoscopy and CT appearances. We believe the colonoscopy sampling may not have been truly representative of the malignant-appearing sigmoid colon lesion seen at colonoscopy and CT. Patient: What's the next step then? Doctor: We have planned an anterior resection for you to remove both the TVA and the potential malignant lesion in the sigmoid colon. This will help us to ensure that we address both possible causes of your symptoms and rule out any malignancy. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. I appreciate it. [/INST] S: The patient reports a 2-month history of altered bowel habits and discomfort. The patient was referred to the surgical outpatient department for further evaluation. O: Physical examinations including abdominal and digital rectal examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory studies including full blood count and biochemistry were normal. Colonoscopy revealed four lesions: two subcentimetre colonic polyps, a mid-rectal tubulovillous adenoma (TVA) with low-grade dysplasia, and a malignant-appearing lesion in the distal sigmoid colon with biopsy showing hyperplastic mucosa, lamina propria fibrosis, and chronic active inflammation but no malignancy. CT scan staged the sigmoid lesion as T2/3 N1 M0, indicating possible malignancy despite biopsy results. A: Primary diagnosis of tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia and a differential diagnosis of potential sigmoid colon malignancy. The symptoms could be attributed to either the rectal TVA or the sigmoid colon lesion. The discrepancy between the colonoscopy and CT findings raises concerns about the representativeness of the biopsy. P: Plan to perform an anterior resection to remove both the rectal TVA and the lesion in the sigmoid colon to address symptoms and rule out malignancy. The surgical approach aims to ensure comprehensive treatment and definitive diagnosis. Further follow-up will be necessary post-surgery to monitor recovery and ensure no recurrence of symptoms or malignancy. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello Patient 1, how are you feeling today? Patient 1: I've been better, doc. I've been experiencing some acute back pain recently. Doctor: I see. Let's go over your medical history. You were diagnosed with stage IIIB, BRAF-negative melanoma of the upper back and left axillary lymph node involvement in 2012. You were treated with wide local excision, which showed a Breslow thickness of 2.9 mm, and axillary lymph node dissection. You also received adjuvant therapy with a GM-CSF secreting allogeneic melanoma cell vaccine for 3 years. Is that correct? Patient 1: Yes, that's right. Doctor: In 2015, you developed recurrent disease at the right buttock, inguinal nodes, and lung. You were then treated with first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy and received a total of 25 doses. Your melanoma showed a complete response to the therapy, according to RECIST 1.1 v.5.0. However, after 20 doses, you started experiencing acute back pain. A contrast-enhanced MRI of the full spine demonstrated multiple non-traumatic vertebral compression fractures, rib fractures, and pelvic fractures, but no bone metastases. Is that correct? Patient 1: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: We continued your pembrolizumab therapy, but you developed additional compression fractures and more profound vertebral wedging, as seen in Fig. This prompted the discontinuation of pembrolizumab after 18 months of therapy. Your biochemical workup was unremarkable. However, your degree of active bone resorption, as measured by C-telopeptide levels, were elevated despite three weeks of alendronate use prior to your appointment. Is that correct? Patient 1: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Your bone density at the hip showed osteopenia only, as lumbar spine was excluded due to the fracture. The histomorphometry from your transiliac bone biopsy revealed increased bone resorption, osteoclast surface, and reduced trabecular and cortical parameters, indicating bone loss. Since your bone loss continued on oral bisphosphonate, we decided to give you one infusion of intravenous bisphosphonate, specifically zoledronic acid. You also underwent multiple kyphoplasty procedures and permanently discontinued pembrolizumab. At present, your melanoma is in complete remission, 35 months after the commencement of pembrolizumab. How are you feeling now, in terms of your back pain? Patient 1: My back pain has improved a bit after the kyphoplasty procedures. Doctor: That's good to hear. We will continue to monitor your progress and ensure that your melanoma remains in complete remission. If you have any concerns or experience any worsening of symptoms, please don't hesitate to reach out. Patient 1: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance throughout this journey. [/INST] S: Patient 1 reports acute back pain, which has improved slightly following kyphoplasty procedures. The patient has a history of stage IIIB, BRAF-negative melanoma with previous treatments including wide local excision, axillary lymph node dissection, adjuvant therapy with a GM-CSF secreting allogeneic melanoma cell vaccine, and pembrolizumab monotherapy. The patient experienced recurrent disease involving the right buttock, inguinal nodes, and lung but achieved complete remission after pembrolizumab treatment. The patient also reports a history of multiple non-traumatic vertebral compression fractures, rib fractures, and pelvic fractures without bone metastases. O: The patient's recent imaging and biochemical workup showed multiple vertebral compression fractures and elevated C-telopeptide levels indicating active bone resorption despite treatment with alendronate. Bone density testing revealed osteopenia at the hip. Histomorphometry from a transiliac bone biopsy indicated increased bone resorption and reduced trabecular and cortical parameters. The patient received one infusion of intravenous bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid) and underwent multiple kyphoplasty procedures. Pembrolizumab was permanently discontinued due to complications. A: Primary diagnosis is osteoporosis secondary to cancer therapy, specifically pembrolizumab, with a history of stage IIIB melanoma currently in complete remission. Differential diagnoses include primary osteoporosis and other secondary causes of osteoporosis. The prognosis for the melanoma is favorable given the complete remission status, but ongoing vigilance for recurrence is necessary. The prognosis for osteoporosis involves managing bone health to prevent further fractures. P: Continue monitoring bone density and C-telopeptide levels to assess the effectiveness of current osteoporosis treatment and adjust as necessary. Maintain the patient on intravenous bisphosphonates and consider additional doses based on follow-up results. Regular follow-up appointments for melanoma surveillance to ensure continued remission. Educate the patient on signs of potential melanoma recurrence and encourage immediate reporting of new symptoms. Provide support for pain management and mobility. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've been admitted to our Department of Dermatology due to swelling and pain in your right hand. Can you tell me more about what happened? Patient: Yeah, I injured my hand at work about 10 days ago. I got cut with a calk and had a 5-mm long wound over my third MCP joint. It was red and swollen. Doctor: I see. It looks like you were examined by a dermatologist, who applied a simple wound dressing and discharged you with a prescription for regular oral antibiotics. How has the wound been since then? Patient: Well, a week later, the swelling and redness got worse, and there was pus-like discharge. That's when I came back to the hospital. Doctor: Thank you for the information. We took Radiographs of your hand and found a visible tooth mark at the third metacarpal head. Your body temperature was also 38.5 °C, and laboratory tests showed an increased number of white blood cells (12.00 × 109/L) and elevated C-reactive protein (25.00 mg/L). Based on these findings, we suspected osteomyelitis of the right third metacarpal head due to a clenched-fist injury. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it can be. We quickly performed wound exploration in the operation room and found a partial lesion of the extensor and the second metacarpal head due to the bite and infection. An intraoperative Gram-stain wound culture was also done, but it didn't reveal any bacteria, likely because of the initial antibiotic treatment you received. Patient: So, what did you do next? Doctor: We performed surgical debridement three times and gave you intravenous systematic antibiotic therapy to completely resolve the osteomyelitis. However, the repeated debridements left a large defect in your third extensor and third metacarpal head, which measured 18 × 15 mm. Patient: That's why my finger is so painful and I can't move it, right? Doctor: Yes, exactly. Your motion arc is 0°, the pinch strength of the injured finger is 1.0 kg, and your DASH score is 52. To treat this, we decided to use an osteochondral vascularised medial femoral trochlea (MFT) flap for the third metacarpal head defect. Patient: How did you get the flap? Doctor: We harvested the flap using the method described by Bürger et al. This procedure should help you regain function in your finger. Patient: I see. Thank you for explaining everything. What should I expect during my recovery? Doctor: You'll likely need some time for the flap to fully integrate, and you may experience some pain and stiffness in your finger. We'll closely monitor your progress and provide any necessary follow-up care to ensure a smooth recovery. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, a male, reports injuring his right hand at work approximately 10 days ago, resulting in a 5-mm wound over the third MCP joint. Initially treated with a simple wound dressing and oral antibiotics, he experienced worsening symptoms a week later, including increased swelling, redness, and pus-like discharge. O: Examination revealed a body temperature of 38.5 °C, elevated white blood cell count (12.00 × 10^9/L), and increased C-reactive protein (25.00 mg/L). Radiographs showed a visible tooth mark at the third metacarpal head. No bacteria were identified in the intraoperative Gram-stain wound culture, likely due to antibiotic effects. Surgical findings included a partial lesion of the extensor and the second metacarpal head, with a large defect (18 × 15 mm) in the third extensor and third metacarpal head. The patient's motion arc is 0°, pinch strength is 1.0 kg, and DASH score is 52. A: The primary diagnosis is osteomyelitis of the right third metacarpal head secondary to a clenched-fist injury. The patient underwent multiple surgical debridements and received intravenous antibiotics. The large defect in the metacarpal head was addressed with an osteochondral vascularised medial femoral trochlea flap.

Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess recovery progress and address any complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, Patient B. I see from your records that you have a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I felt a sudden onset of palpitations and chest pain about 45 minutes ago. The pain even radiated to my right shoulder and neck. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Did you experience any other symptoms? Perhaps sweatiness, dyspnea, or fever? Patient: Yes, I felt a bit sweaty, but I didn't have any trouble breathing or a fever. Doctor: Alright. When you arrived at the ED, you seemed alert and not in pain or distress. Upon examination, we found that you were tachycardic, but your blood pressure was normal. Your lungs also had clear air entry. We performed an ECG and discovered that you have SVT. Patient: Oh, okay. What does that mean? Doctor: SVT stands for supraventricular tachycardia. It's a condition where your heart beats faster than normal. We performed a head down deep breathing maneuver to help convert your heart back to a normal sinus rhythm. Fortunately, there were no complications from the procedure. Patient: That's good to hear. What about my blood pressure after the maneuver? Doctor: Your blood pressure was 131/73, which is within the normal range. We also checked your initial serum Troponin T levels, which were 10 ng/L. The normal lab range is 0-29 ng/L. Patient: So, my Troponin T levels are normal then? Doctor: Yes, they are within the normal range. However, given the earlier presence of chest pain and your cardiovascular risk factors, we decided to admit you to cardiology for observation. Patient: I understand. What happened during the observation? Doctor: Your subsequent Troponin T levels remained normal, and we performed an echocardiogram the next day. It showed normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and diastolic function, with no structural heart disease. Patient: That's a relief! So, what's the next step for me? Doctor: As your tests showed no concerning issues, you were discharged from the hospital. We will continue to monitor your hypertension and dyslipidemia, and it's important that you follow up with your primary care physician for further evaluation and management. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and will follow up with my primary care physician. [/INST] S: Patient B, with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, presented with sudden onset of palpitations and chest pain radiating to the right shoulder and neck approximately 45 minutes prior to arrival. The patient also experienced sweatiness but no dyspnea or fever. O: Upon examination in the ED, the patient was alert, tachycardic with a heart rate of 150 bpm, and had a blood pressure of 131/73 mmHg. Lungs had clear air entry. An ECG indicated supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Initial serum Troponin T was 10 ng/L (normal range 0-29 ng/L). A head down deep breathing maneuver was successfully performed, converting the heart rate to normal sinus rhythm. Follow-up echocardiogram showed normal LV ejection fraction and diastolic function with no structural heart disease. A: The primary diagnosis is supraventricular tachycardia. Differential diagnoses initially included acute coronary syndrome, given the chest pain and cardiovascular risk factors, but this was ruled out with normal Troponin levels and echocardiogram findings. P: Patient was discharged with instructions to continue monitoring hypertension and dyslipidemia. Follow-up with a primary care physician is recommended for further evaluation and management of SVT and existing cardiovascular risk factors.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Good morning, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been feeling pain in my right knee while running for more than 3 months now. It's especially painful on the lateral side. Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any restrictions in your movement or any other symptoms? Patient: Yes, I've noticed that my knee extension is limited. It's restricted to about 10 degrees. Doctor: Okay, let's perform a physical examination to understand the issue better. I'm going to perform the McMurray test. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort. Patient: Hmm, I feel some discomfort during the test. Doctor: It seems that the McMurray test is positive, but there's no instability. We will need to conduct some imaging tests to get more information. Let's start with an X-ray. Patient: Alright, doctor. (After the X-ray) Doctor: The X-ray findings show no remarkable issues. However, to get a clearer picture, let's do an MRI. Patient: Okay, sure. (After the MRI) Doctor: The MRI results show that the DLM has a horizontal high signal cleavage. Based on this, I recommend that you undergo surgery followed by postoperative therapy, similar to a previous case I've handled. Patient: I understand, doctor. I'm willing to go through with the surgery and therapy. (After two years) Doctor: How have you been feeling since the surgery? Patient: I've been great, doctor! I have no symptoms while running, and my range of motion is back to normal. Doctor: That's excellent to hear. I just reviewed your recent X-ray, and it shows a slight narrowing of the lateral joint space. The MRI also shows a thin lateral meniscus that has maintained its width at 12.1 mm with no progression of coronal or sagittal extrusion. Patient: That's a relief. Thank you so much, doctor, for all your help! Doctor: You're welcome! Just remember to continue with any recommended exercises and follow-ups to maintain your knee health. If you have any concerns in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. [/INST] S: The patient, a runner, reports experiencing pain in the right knee, particularly on the lateral side, for over three months. The pain is associated with limited knee extension, restricted to about 10 degrees. The patient expressed discomfort during the McMurray test. O: Physical examination revealed a positive McMurray test with no instability. Initial X-ray of the right knee showed no remarkable findings. Subsequent MRI indicated a horizontal high signal cleavage in the discoid lateral meniscus (DLM). Follow-up imaging two years post-surgery showed slight narrowing of the lateral joint space and a thin lateral meniscus with maintained width at 12.1 mm, without progression of coronal or sagittal extrusion. A: The primary diagnosis is a torn discoid lateral meniscus based on the MRI findings and clinical presentation. The patient underwent successful surgical intervention with postoperative therapy, leading to resolution of symptoms and restoration of normal knee function. P: The patient was advised to undergo surgery for the torn DLM, followed by postoperative therapy. Post-surgery, the patient reported significant improvement and return to normal activities without symptoms. Continued monitoring of the knee's condition through periodic imaging was recommended. The patient was also advised to maintain knee health through recommended exercises and follow-ups. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been having intermittent, crampy right-sided abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for the past 18 hours. It's really bothering me. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history and any previous surgeries you've had? Patient: Yes, I have hypertension. I also had a thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer and a Caesarean section in the past. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Given your symptoms, I'd like to perform a contrast-enhanced CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better understanding of your condition. Is that okay with you? Patient: Sure, let's do it. (After the CT scan) Doctor: The CT scan shows multiple fluid-filled, dilated small bowel loops in your right abdomen. We've identified two transition points in the right lower quadrant, one at the distal ileum and another in the proximal ileum. These findings are indicative of a closed loop obstruction. There's also decreased wall enhancement of the dilated small bowel loops, which is concerning for ischemia. Patient: Oh no, what does that mean? Doctor: Ischemia means that there's a lack of blood supply to that area, which can be dangerous. Given your symptoms and the findings on the CT scan, we need to take you to the operating room for further examination and treatment. Patient: Okay, I understand. (In the operating room) Doctor: We've confirmed that you have an internal hernia with closed loop obstruction. It appears to have been caused by an adhesion of a transverse colon epiploic appendage to the ascending colon mesentery. Unfortunately, the herniated small bowel is nonviable, so we had to resect, or remove, a total of 60 cm of your small bowel. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What happens next? Doctor: After the resection, we've left your small bowel in discontinuity and placed an abdominal wound-vac. You'll need to return to the operating room tomorrow for further assessment. (The following day) Doctor: We found that the terminal ileum was also nonviable, so we performed an ileocecectomy with enterocolonic anastomosis to repair the damage. Patient: Will I recover from this? Doctor: Your postoperative course may be complicated, but with proper care, you should recover. You'll be discharged approximately two weeks after the initial surgery. We'll monitor your progress closely and provide you with the necessary care during your recovery. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient reports intermittent, crampy right-sided abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for the past 18 hours. She has a history of hypertension, thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer, and a Caesarean section. O: The contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed multiple fluid-filled, dilated small bowel loops in the right abdomen with two transition points in the right lower quadrant, one at the distal ileum and another in the proximal ileum, indicative of a closed loop obstruction. Decreased wall enhancement of the dilated small bowel loops suggested ischemia. Surgical findings confirmed an internal hernia with closed loop obstruction due to adhesion of a transverse colon epiploic appendage to the ascending colon mesentery. A total of 60 cm of nonviable small bowel was resected. Subsequent surgery involved an ileocecectomy with enterocolonic anastomosis. A: The primary diagnosis is internal hernia with closed loop small bowel obstruction and bowel ischemia. The patient underwent bowel resection and ileocecectomy due to nonviable bowel segments. P: The patient was taken to the operating room for emergency surgery and required multiple procedures including bowel resection and ileocecectomy. Postoperatively, the patient will be closely monitored in the hospital and will require a follow-up surgery to assess bowel continuity and function. Discharge is planned for approximately two weeks post-initial surgery, with close outpatient follow-up for monitoring recovery and managing any complications. Education on signs of infection, proper wound care, and dietary adjustments will be provided. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I received a referral for your two-month-old son to evaluate a left postauricular mass that has been present since birth. Can you tell me more about it? Parent: Yes, we noticed this mass at birth, and it's been painless but slowly growing. Our pediatrician did an ultrasound and thought it was a cystic mass, so they referred us for surgical excision. Doctor: I see. Based on the physical exam, we found a firm 2 × 2 cm subcutaneous lesion in the postauricular region. We also did an MRI which showed a 2.3 × 1.4 × 2.2 cm well-defined solid mass involving the outer table of the right temporal bone and temporoparietal suture with intense peripheral enhancement. Parent: What does that mean? Doctor: It means that the mass is connected to the skull and has some abnormal growth. We performed an initial resection in the operating room and identified a deep plane between the mass and skull. We were able to remove the mass, but the pathology report showed that there were still some tumor cells at the peripheral margin. Parent: So, what did you do next? Doctor: Your son underwent a repeat resection with a canal wall up mastoidectomy. We resected the lesion en bloc and drilled down to the inner table of the temporal bone. Although the bone appeared healthy, the pathology report again showed tumor cells at the soft tissue margins. Unfortunately, your son also had significant regrowth of the lesion. Parent: That sounds concerning. What was the next step? Doctor: We brought your son back to the operating room for a revision mastoidectomy due to the impressive progression of the gross tumor, which was nearly 2.5 × 2.0 cm. We sought a neurosurgical consultation, and the mass was excised en bloc, resulting in a full-thickness craniectomy. Parent: How did that go? Doctor: The dura, which is the outermost layer covering the brain, appeared healthy and unaffected by the tumor. We closed the wound, and your son was observed overnight in the PICU before being discharged home on postoperative day one in stable condition. Parent: But then he developed an infection, right? Doctor: Yes, one month postoperatively, he developed purulence at his incision site, which required an intra-washout with neurosurgery. Fortunately, the infection resolved without any further complications or additional treatment requirements. Parent: How is he doing now? Doctor: We saw your son at his six-month postoperative appointment, and I'm pleased to report that there is no evidence of disease. We will continue to monitor him closely to ensure his ongoing health. [/INST] S: The patient, a two-month-old male, presented with a left postauricular mass noted since birth. The mass was described as painless and slowly growing. The patient's parent reported that an initial ultrasound suggested a cystic mass, leading to a referral for surgical evaluation. O: Physical examination revealed a firm 2 × 2 cm subcutaneous lesion in the postauricular region. MRI findings showed a 2.3 × 1.4 × 2.2 cm well-defined solid mass involving the outer table of the right temporal bone and temporoparietal suture with intense peripheral enhancement. Surgical interventions included an initial resection, a repeat resection with canal wall up mastoidectomy, and a revision mastoidectomy with full-thickness craniectomy. Postoperative complications included a purulent infection at the incision site, which was managed with intra-washout. The pathology report indicated persistent tumor cells at the margins after the first two surgeries, but no evidence of disease at the six-month postoperative follow-up. A: The primary diagnosis is a malignant tumor of the temporal bone, with differential diagnoses including benign bone tumors or cystic lesions initially considered. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the current absence of disease, though the aggressive nature of the tumor and the need for multiple surgeries indicate a potentially challenging long-term management. P: The management plan included multiple surgical resections and postoperative monitoring in the PICU. The patient was treated for a postoperative infection with intra-washout and antibiotics. Ongoing care involves regular follow-ups to monitor for recurrence of the tumor. Further consultations with neurosurgery and oncology may be necessary depending on future findings. Education regarding signs of recurrence or infection was provided to the parents to ensure prompt reporting and management. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, I understand you're a 17-year-old horse rider and you were referred to our clinic. Can you tell me about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, for the past 2 weeks, I've been having this continuous, crampy abdominal pain. It started in the epigastric region and then shifted to the left upper quadrant. I've also been feeling fatigued and lost my appetite. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, or night sweats? Patient: No, none of those. Doctor: Have you had any other issues, like with your shoulders? Patient: I did have some left shoulder pain a while ago, but the MRI came back negative. Doctor: Okay, let's move on to your physical exam. We found that you have splenomegaly, which means your spleen is enlarged, about 9 cm below the costal margins. You also have tenderness in the left upper quadrant, but no rebound tenderness. Your laboratory examination results showed a hemoglobin level of 12.8 g/dL, platelet count of 124,000/mm, and white blood cell count of 6,500/mm with 62% neutrophils, 24% lymphocytes, and 7% eosinophils. Your liver enzymes, bilirubin, albumin, LDH, and chemistry panel were all within normal range. Patient: Hmm, okay. What about the ultrasound? Doctor: The abdominal ultrasound showed a large splenic cyst, about 15 cm in size, containing homogenous internal debris. We also did a computed tomography scan which showed the same 15 cm splenic cyst with parietal calcifications, compressing the stomach. It's most likely of hydatid origin. Patient: So what could be causing this? Doctor: Based on the findings, the differential diagnosis includes splenic abscess, hydatid cyst, epithelial cyst, and post-traumatic hemorrhage in a pre-existing epithelial cyst. We've narrowed it down to most likely being a hydatid cyst. Patient: Did you do any tests for infections or anything? Doctor: Yes, we performed serologic tests for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), HIV, toxoplasmosis, Entamoeba histolytica, Leishmania brazilensis, donovani, and EBV IgM. All of these tests came back negative. However, your EBV IgG was elevated, which indicates prior immunization. Patient: What about tests for the hydatid cyst? Doctor: We performed an immune-diffusion test for Echinococcus multilocularis, which was negative. We also did an indirect hemagglutination test and an ELISA test for Echinococcus granulosus, both of which were negative as well. Patient: So what does this mean for me? Doctor: While the tests for hydatid cysts were negative, the clinical picture and the fact that you live in an area where hydatid cysts are common lead us to believe that it's most likely the cause. We'll need to discuss treatment options and closely monitor your condition. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. [/INST] S: The patient, a 17-year-old horse rider, reports continuous, crampy abdominal pain for the past 2 weeks, initially in the epigastric region, now localized to the left upper quadrant. The patient also experiences fatigue and appetite loss. No symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, or night sweats were reported. The patient had previous left shoulder pain, but MRI results were negative. O: Physical examination revealed splenomegaly, approximately 9 cm below the costal margins, and tenderness in the left upper quadrant without rebound tenderness. Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin at 12.8 g/dL, platelet count at 124,000/mm³, and white blood cell count at 6,500/mm³ with 62% neutrophils, 24% lymphocytes, and 7% eosinophils. Liver enzymes, bilirubin, albumin, LDH, and chemistry panel were normal. Abdominal ultrasound and CT scan identified a 15 cm splenic cyst with homogenous internal debris and parietal calcifications, compressing the stomach. Serologic tests for various infections were negative, but EBV IgG was elevated. Tests for Echinococcus were negative. A: The primary assessment is a large splenic cyst, most likely of hydatid origin, despite negative serologic tests for Echinococcus. Differential diagnoses include splenic abscess, epithelial cyst, and post-traumatic hemorrhage in a pre-existing epithelial cyst. The presence of splenomegaly, specific imaging findings, and regional epidemiology support the diagnosis of a hydatid cyst. P: The management plan will include close monitoring of the cyst and symptomatic treatment for abdominal pain and fatigue. Surgical consultation will be considered for potential cyst removal. Patient education on the nature of hydatid cysts and the importance of follow-up will be provided. Regular follow-ups will be scheduled to monitor the cyst's size and symptoms. Compliance with follow-up appointments and treatment adherence will be emphasized. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, what brings you to the emergency room today? Patient: My family brought me here because of worsening confusion that started 3 days ago. They say I've been acting strange and sending them gibberish text messages. Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any other changes in yourself? Patient: Yeah, I've been very quiet lately and having trouble finding words. My speech doesn't make any sense, and I seem to be indifferent and inattentive at times. I've also had urinary incontinence. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you experienced any fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, diplopia, or seizure activity recently? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. Doctor: What about any skin rash or ulcers? I see that you like to garden in your free time. Patient: No, I don't have any skin rash or ulcers. Doctor: Thank you for sharing this information. We have conducted a general physical examination, and everything seems to be unremarkable. You appear well-nourished, and your vital signs are within normal limits. We also conducted an ophthalmological examination which showed bilateral 3 mm reactive pupils with full conjugate extraocular movements. There was no nystagmus or ptosis. Your visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: The funduscopic examination revealed slightly blurred disk margins on the left, with sharp disk margins on the right. The retinal vascularity was normal. You were alert and cooperative during the examination. You were oriented to yourself and time but not to place. You could add simple numbers but had difficulty with serial seven subtractions and were slow to spell ""world"" backward. Patient: Yes, that's true. Doctor: Your speech was fluent but with intermittent misuse of words and expressive dysphasia. Cranial nerves 2 through 12 were intact, except for a right eyelid droop. Your motor examination showed a slight pronator drift of the right arm. You had 5/5 muscle power in the upper and lower extremities, and your deep tendon reflexes were symmetric. Patient: So, what does all this mean, doc? Doctor: Based on your symptoms and examination results, it seems that you are experiencing some cognitive and speech difficulties. We will need to run some more tests to determine the cause of your confusion and other symptoms. In the meantime, it's important to keep an eye on your symptoms, and let us know if anything changes or worsens. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. I'll keep you updated. [/INST] S: The patient, accompanied by family, presented with a chief complaint of worsening confusion over the past three days, characterized by gibberish text messaging, reduced speech output, difficulty finding words, expressive dysphasia, and urinary incontinence. The patient denies experiencing fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, diplopia, seizure activity, skin rash, or ulcers. O: General physical and ophthalmological examinations were conducted. Vital signs were within normal limits. Visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye. Funduscopic examination showed slightly blurred disk margins on the left. The patient was alert and cooperative, oriented to self and time but not place, and had difficulty with serial seven subtractions. Speech was fluent with intermittent misuse of words. Cranial nerves 2 through 12 were intact except for a right eyelid droop. Motor examination revealed slight pronator drift of the right arm, with 5/5 muscle power in all extremities and symmetric deep tendon reflexes. A: The patient exhibits signs of cognitive impairment and speech difficulties, suggestive of a neurological disorder. Differential diagnoses could include cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or a space-occupying lesion. The slight pronator drift and right eyelid droop raise concerns for a possible focal neurological deficit. P: Plan to conduct further diagnostic tests including CT or MRI of the brain to assess for stroke or other neurological abnormalities. Neurology consultation is recommended for comprehensive evaluation and management. Monitor neurological status closely and re-evaluate as necessary. Educate the patient and family about the importance of monitoring symptoms and seeking immediate care if symptoms worsen. Ensure follow-up appointments are scheduled and attended. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you have been admitted to the emergency service. Can you please tell me about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've been having hiccups and fever for the past six weeks. The hiccups usually happen when there's some lead stimulation. Doctor: I see. I understand you have a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and had a dual chamber pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator implanted due to atrioventricular complete block three months ago, is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. I had a coronary angiography before the procedure, and they said my arteries were normal. Doctor: Okay, and I also see that you were given antibiotic therapy for a fever six weeks after the implantation. You have a history of diabetes and hypertension for 10 years, correct? Patient: Yes, that's accurate. Doctor: When you were admitted, your fever was at 39.5°C, blood pressure at 100/50 mmHg, and heart rate at 100/min. We also noted rough pulmonary sounds, but no crepitation, and a 2/6 pansystolic murmur at all cardiac foci. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs? Patient: Yeah, there's been some mild edema in both of my legs. Doctor: We also observed splinter hemorrhages in your nails. Your electrocardiogram showed pacemaker rhythms and a bigeminy ventricular extrasystole. A chest x-ray revealed a bilateral reticulonodular pattern, bilateral pleural effusions, and an increased cardiothoracic index. The pacemaker generator implanted in your left pectoral region was present along with two leads, which appeared to extend into the heart.  Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: Your lab tests showed a WBC of 12,300/m3, sedimentation of 62mm, and CRP of 235 mg/L. Your HbA1C level was 6.2%. With these clinical manifestations, you were hospitalized with the diagnosis of unknown fever and hiccups in the department of infectious diseases. You were started on drug therapy with sulbactam, ampicillin, and ciprofloxacin.  Patient: Okay, and how did that go? Doctor: Your blood culture yielded a positive result for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus. Your body temperature decreased for a while, but it increased again to 39°C on day nine. Consequently, you were designated to undergo a transthoracic echocardiography. Unfortunately, your hiccups have continued throughout this period. Patient: Oh, I see. So, what's the next step in my treatment? Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your medications as needed. We'll also perform regular tests to track your progress. It's essential to keep a close eye on your symptoms and report any changes to your medical team. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you through this process. [/INST] S: The patient reports persistent hiccups and fever for six weeks, exacerbated by lead stimulation from a pacemaker. The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, atrioventricular complete block, diabetes, and hypertension. He underwent pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation three months ago, followed by antibiotic therapy for fever. He also reports mild edema in both legs. O: On admission, the patient's vital signs were: fever at 39.5°C, blood pressure at 100/50 mmHg, and heart rate at 100/min. Physical examination revealed rough pulmonary sounds, a 2/6 pansystolic murmur at all cardiac foci, and splinter hemorrhages in nails.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I'm a 40-year-old woman, gravida 2, and parity 1. I was referred to your hospital at 23 weeks and 2 days of gestation due to placenta previa and severe FGR. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your previous delivery? Patient: Yes, my previous delivery was a normal vaginal delivery, but I had a manual removal of the placenta. Doctor: Alright, let's discuss the results of your recent ultrasound examination. It showed no fetal anomaly, but the estimated fetal body weight (EFBW) was 258 g (-3.7 SD), indicating severe FGR. Additionally, placenta previa and enlargement of the placenta (8 × 9 × 7 cm) were confirmed. Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. What about the umbilical cord? Doctor: The umbilical cord was inserted into the center of the placenta, and the umbilical artery end-diastolic flow velocity was normal. Patient: Hmm, and what about my blood test results? Doctor: Your blood sample results were as follows: Hb, 12.4 g/dL (normal range: 11.6-4.8 g/dL); platelet count, 99,000/μL (158,000-348,000/µL); APTT, 27 seconds (24.5-38.7 seconds); PT-INR, 0.88 (0.90-1.10); and D-dimer levels, 0.9 µg/L (≦1.0 µg/L). Based on these results, your thrombocytopenia was diagnosed as gestational thrombocytopenia, not idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Patient: I see. Am I taking any medications for this? Doctor: Are you currently taking aspirin or any other anticoagulants? Patient: No, I'm not taking any of those medications. Doctor: Good to know. You also do not have thrombophilia, such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), protein S deficiency, or protein C deficiency. Your condition has been diagnosed as idiopathic placentomegaly with severe FGR. Patient: What did the pelvic MRI show? Doctor: The pelvic MRI at 24 weeks and 3 days of gestation revealed that the placenta showed internal heterogeneity and enlargement. Furthermore, placenta previa and a fluid-fluid level on the fetal side of the placenta with no blood flow were identified. Patient: And what about the most recent ultrasound examination? Doctor: The ultrasound examination at 24 weeks and 4 days of gestation confirmed the presence of an MSH in a clear fluid-fluid level forming on the side of the fetus in the placenta, measuring 2.8 × 7. Patient: Oh, I see. What are the next steps for me? Doctor: We will continue to closely monitor your condition and the development of the fetus. It's important to attend all your follow-up appointments and report any changes in your symptoms. We'll work together to ensure the best possible outcome for you and your baby. [/INST] S: A 40-year-old woman, gravida 2, parity 1, at 23 weeks and 2 days of gestation, presents with placenta previa and severe fetal growth restriction (FGR). She reports a history of manual placenta removal during her previous normal vaginal delivery. She denies taking aspirin or any anticoagulants. O: Recent ultrasound examination shows no fetal anomalies but confirms severe FGR with an estimated fetal body weight of 258 g (-3.7 SD), placenta previa, and placental enlargement (8 × 9 × 7 cm). Umbilical cord insertion is central with normal end-diastolic flow velocity in the umbilical artery. Blood tests reveal Hb 12.4 g/dL, platelet count 99,000/μL, APTT 27 seconds, PT-INR 0.88, and D-dimer 0.9 µg/L, indicating gestational thrombocytopenia. Pelvic MRI shows placental internal heterogeneity, enlargement, and a fluid-fluid level on the fetal side of the placenta with no blood flow. Latest ultrasound confirms an MSH in a clear fluid-fluid level on the fetal side of the placenta, measuring 2.8 × 7 cm. A: The primary diagnosis is idiopathic placentomegaly with severe FGR and placenta previa. Differential diagnoses include complications from placenta previa such as potential bleeding and preterm delivery. The prognosis depends on careful monitoring and management of placenta previa and FGR. P: Continue close monitoring of the patient's condition and fetal development through regular follow-up appointments and ultrasounds. Educate the patient on the importance of reporting any new symptoms or changes. No current indication for aspirin or anticoagulant therapy. Prepare for potential complications related to placenta previa and severe FGR, including the possibility of preterm delivery and the need for specialized neonatal care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you have a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and strokes. Can you tell me about any new symptoms you've been experiencing recently? Patient: Yeah, I've been having these weird episodes where I get unsteady on my feet, feel weakness on my left side, and have trouble seeing clearly. I also get dizzy sometimes. Doctor: Hmm, it sounds like you might be experiencing transient ischemic attacks, which are temporary disruptions in blood flow to the brain. We'll need to do a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of your neck to get a better understanding of what's going on. Patient: Okay, sounds good. (After the CTA) Doctor: Your CTA results show moderate stenoses in your left vertebral artery (VA) V4 and origin. This could be causing your symptoms. We're going to start you on aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin to help manage your condition. Patient: Alright, if you think that'll help. (After 4 months) Doctor: It's been 4 months since we started your medications. How are your symptoms? Patient: To be honest, they haven't really improved much. I still get those episodes. Doctor: I see. We'll need to do a repeat CTA of your neck to check for any progression. (After the repeat CTA) Doctor: The imaging shows that the stenoses in your left VA have progressed, and there's now a thrombus in the V4 segment. We'll start you on oral anticoagulation for 2 weeks to see if that helps. Patient: Okay, I hope that works. (After 2 weeks) Patient: My symptoms haven't improved after taking the anticoagulation medication. Doctor: In that case, we'll proceed with an elective cerebral angiogram to treat the left VA origin. (After the cerebral angiogram) Doctor: The cerebral angiogram showed 90% left VA origin stenosis and distal V4 segment occlusion. We performed angioplasty, and now there's only 50% remaining stenosis of the proximal left VA. The blood flow has also significantly improved. Patient: That's good to hear. (After the procedure) Patient: I had a new onset of weakness and tingling in my left arm, but it went away after 10 minutes. Doctor: That's not unusual after the procedure. We'll monitor you for a couple of days and then you can be discharged without needing physiotherapy. (A few days later) Patient: I came back to the emergency room because I started feeling tingling on my left side and my gait became unsteady again. Doctor: We'll perform an MRI brain and a dedicated MRI cervical spine to check for any issues. (After the MRI) Doctor: The MRI results show an acute posterior upper cervical cord infarction. Your CTA neck results show no restenosis of the left VA origin and the V4 segment is patent with resolution of the previously seen thrombus. Your physical examination revealed decreased vibration and proprioception, as well as dysmetria on the left upper and lower extremities with a positive Babinski sign. However, there's no loss of temperature or pain sensations. Patient: What's the plan now, doc? Doctor: We'll discharge you home and have you continue taking aspirin and clopidogrel. You'll also need outpatient physiotherapy to help with your recovery. (Three months later) Patient: My left-side tingling is gone, but I still have some mild coordination issues and gait imbalance. Doctor: That's an improvement from before. Keep up with the physiotherapy, and we'll continue monitoring your progress. [/INST] S: Patient reports episodes of unsteadiness, left-sided weakness, and blurry vision, with occasional dizziness. History of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and strokes. Symptoms persisted despite initial treatment with aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin. After progression of stenosis and thrombus formation, symptoms did not improve with oral anticoagulation. Post-angioplasty, patient experienced transient left arm weakness and tingling. Recently, patient returned with tingling and unsteady gait, leading to the discovery of an acute posterior upper cervical cord infarction. O: Initial CTA showed moderate stenoses in left vertebral artery V4 and origin. Repeat CTA indicated progression with thrombus formation. Post-angioplasty CTA showed improvement with 50% remaining stenosis. Recent MRI revealed acute posterior upper cervical cord infarction, no restenosis of left VA, and patent V4 segment. Physical exam showed decreased vibration and proprioception, dysmetria, and positive Babinski sign on the left side, but no loss of temperature or pain sensations. A: Primary diagnosis is vertebral artery stenosis with complications including transient ischemic attacks and acute posterior upper cervical cord infarction. Differential diagnoses could include other sources of emboli or vascular malformations. P: Continue aspirin and clopidogrel. Initiate outpatient physiotherapy focusing on coordination and gait training. Monitor neurological status and vascular imaging periodically to assess for any further vascular changes or neurological deterioration. Encourage patient adherence to medication and physiotherapy regimen to optimize recovery and prevent further complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm here to discuss the report of your male baby who was born in a peripheral setting at 36 weeks of gestation to you, a 36-year-old primiparous mother. Your pregnancy was complicated by breech presentation and premature rupture of membranes at 34 weeks of gestation. Can you tell me about any symptoms you experienced during the pregnancy or delivery? Mother: Yes, I had some difficulty during the delivery due to the breech presentation and the premature rupture of membranes. Doctor: I see. Your baby was delivered by emergency caesarean section with maternal general anaesthetic due to fetal distress and cord prolapse. His Apgar scores were 4, 5, 5, and 8 at one, five, ten, and fifteen minutes respectively. He required mask ventilation at birth for primary apnoea and was intubated at seven minutes of postnatal age for persistent apnoea. At 30 minutes of life, he was extubated to CPAP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 was weaned from 100 to 44%. How has his breathing been since then? Mother: He seemed to be breathing a bit fast and with some effort, but I wasn't sure if it was normal or not. Doctor: It's normal to be concerned. On these settings, he had a tachypnoea of 90 breaths per minute with mildly increased respiratory effort and a pre-ductal oxygen saturation of ≥97%. We performed a capillary blood gas test, which excluded respiratory or metabolic acidosis. We also started him on empiric antibiotics, benzylpenicillin and gentamicin, to cover the risk of sepsis due to the prolonged rupture of membranes. We took chest x-rays at 2 and 4 hours of life, which showed crescent-shaped homogeneous opacities in both upper lung fields. The Neonatal and Paediatric Emergency Transport Service (NETS) was consulted. Mother: What did they say? Doctor: Initial paediatric radiological advice via telemedicine was that this appearance could represent bilateral pleural effusions. Accordingly, the PEEP was increased to 8cmH2O; however, a lateral decubitus x-ray was uninformative. Due to the uncertainty regarding the cause of the respiratory distress, the baby was transferred to the local neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by NETS at 10 hours of postnatal life. Mother: Was there any progress after the transfer? Doctor: A progress CXR at just under 13 hours of age was still inconclusive. However, a lateral decubitus film performed concurrently demonstrated air anterior to the mediastinum, consistent with a diagnosis of pneumomediastinum. As a result, all respiratory support was ceased. Mother: That's a relief. What about the risk of infection? Doctor: Laboratory markers for infection were negative, with a white cell count of 15.6 × 109. This is a good sign, as it indicates that there is no ongoing infection. We will continue to monitor him closely and provide any necessary care. Mother: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate all the help and information. [/INST] S: The patient is a male neonate born at 36 weeks gestation via emergency caesarean section due to fetal distress and cord prolapse. The mother reported difficulty during delivery due to breech presentation and premature rupture of membranes at 34 weeks. Post-delivery, the baby exhibited primary and persistent apnoea, requiring respiratory support. The mother observed the baby breathing fast and with some effort. O: At birth, the neonate's Apgar scores were 4, 5, 5, and 8 at one, five, ten, and fifteen minutes respectively. He required mask ventilation and was intubated at seven minutes, later transitioned to CPAP with initial FiO2 of 100% weaned to 44%. Tachypnoea was noted at 90 breaths per minute with pre-ductal oxygen saturation of ≥97%. Capillary blood gas excluded acidosis. Chest x-rays showed crescent-shaped opacities in both upper lung fields, suggestive of bilateral pleural effusions. Subsequent imaging indicated pneumomediastinum. Laboratory tests showed a white cell count of 15.6 × 10^9, within normal limits, indicating no ongoing infection. A: The primary diagnosis is pneumomediastinum, likely secondary to barotrauma from respiratory support. Differential diagnoses initially included bilateral pleural effusions and potential sepsis due to prolonged rupture of membranes, which were ruled out by further investigations and laboratory tests. P: The management plan included initial respiratory support with CPAP and mechanical ventilation, empiric antibiotic therapy with benzylpenicillin and gentamicin, and close monitoring in the NICU. Respiratory support was ceased following confirmation of pneumomediastinum. Ongoing care will focus on monitoring for any further respiratory distress or signs of infection, with adjustments to treatment as necessary based on clinical progress and laboratory findings. </s>"

It looks like your complete blood count in December 2016 showed a hemoglobin of 13 g/dl, a white blood cell count of 7 × 109/L, and a platelet count of 4 × 109/L. Your urinalysis and renal and liver function tests were normal. Your blood tests, including viral hepatitis, anti-human immunodeficiency virus, and antiphospholipid profiles, were all negative. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Can you please tell me about the medications you are currently taking? Patient: I'm taking losartan 100 mg/day, metformin 2000 mg/day, glipizide 20 mg/day, pioglitazone 30 mg/day, atorvastatin 40 mg/day, and methimazole 5 mg/day. Doctor: Thank you. It seems that your platelet count responded well to the normal range with oral prednisolone, and the prednisolone was tapered in January 2017. But you had a relapse in August 2017, presenting with bleeding from the gums. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's when I had my first relapse. Doctor: I understand that your treatment was reinitiated with steroids, and once your CBC was normal, the treatment was gradually tapered. However, the last event occurred in October 2017, when your platelet count dropped to 36 × 109/L without any clinical bleeding. After treatment with high-dose prednisolone for 1 month, your platelet count recovered to the normal range. But you couldn't maintain your platelet count with prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day. Is that accurate? Patient: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: Given your situation, I recommend a combination therapy of 50 mg/day of azathioprine and 200 mg/day of danazol, along with high-dose prednisolone. This should help you maintain your platelet count. Patient: Okay, I understand. What should I do if I experience any side effects or issues with this treatment? Doctor: If you experience any side effects or issues, please contact me or another healthcare professional immediately. We will closely monitor your condition and adjust the treatment if necessary. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome. Please take care and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. [/INST] S: The patient, diagnosed with relapsed/refractory Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) in December 2016, reports a history of petechiae on legs and bleeding from the gums during a relapse in August 2017. The patient has comorbidities including poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperthyroidism. No family history of hematological disorders is reported. The patient is currently on multiple medications including losartan, metformin, glipizide, pioglitazone, atorvastatin, and methimazole. O: Initial labs from December 2016 showed hemoglobin at 13 g/dl, white blood cell count at 7 × 10^9/L, and critically low platelet count at 4 × 10^9/L. Urinalysis and renal and liver function tests were normal. Viral hepatitis, HIV, and antiphospholipid profiles were negative. Recent platelet counts have fluctuated, with a drop to 36 × 10^9/L in October 2017, but recovered to normal after high-dose prednisolone treatment. Current medications include losartan 100 mg/day, metformin 2000 mg/day, glipizide 20 mg/day, pioglitazone 30 mg/day, atorvastatin 40 mg/day, and methimazole 5 mg/day. A: The primary diagnosis is relapsed/refractory ITP. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of thrombocytopenia, but these are less likely given the patient's specific history and lab results. The patient's ITP is complicated by multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and hyperthyroidism, which may affect overall management and prognosis. P: The management plan includes initiating combination therapy with azathioprine 50 mg/day, danazol 200 mg/day, and continuing high-dose prednisolone. The patient will be closely monitored for side effects and response to therapy, with adjustments made as necessary. Emphasis will be placed on managing comorbid conditions to optimize overall health. The patient is advised to contact healthcare providers immediately if side effects or issues arise. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess treatment efficacy and make necessary adjustments. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented to our hospital with worsening mental status. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've been experiencing some gait instability, like I'm having trouble walking. And I've also been having difficulty speaking and expressing myself. Doctor: I understand. You've had a thorough physical examination and we've noted your expressive aphasia and gait instability. You are otherwise hemodynamically stable, and your laboratory studies and urine drug screen came back negative. We performed a computed tomography (CT) of your head without contrast, and it showed a large right frontoparietal lesion with surrounding vasogenic edema. Patient: Oh my, that sounds serious. What does it mean? Doctor: We needed more information, so we did a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to further characterize the lesion. It showed a 5.5-cm mass in the deep white matter of your right frontal lobe, with gadolinium enhancement and a prominent FLAIR signal. This is concerning for malignancy. Patient: So, it could be cancer? Doctor: Yes, it's possible. To investigate further, we started you on dexamethasone and performed a frontal stereotactic brain biopsy. The initial pathology report showed a B-cell lymphoma, with cells positive for CD20 immunostain. However, due to the complexity of the case, we sent the sample for a second opinion at another institution. Patient: And what did they find? Doctor: The second opinion confirmed the presence of the MYD88L265P mutation. Because this mutation is strongly associated with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), we measured your quantitative serum immunoglobulins. The test showed an elevated IgM monoclonal paraprotein, which confirms the diagnosis of WM. Patient: So what's the plan for treatment? Doctor: We started you on a treatment regimen with rituximab, methylprednisolone, carfilzomib, and ibrutinib. You showed a good response to this treatment by MRI at three months, and we then transitioned you to oral ibrutinib only. Patient: That's good news, right? Doctor: Yes, but during a surveillance MRI at one year post-diagnosis, we found patchy right frontal lobe enhancement, indicating disease progression, even though you had no clinical symptoms. As a result, we restarted the initial chemo-immunotherapy protocol. Patient: But then what happened? Doctor: Unfortunately, we had to hold the ibrutinib due to thrombocytopenia. After that, you presented to the hospital again with cognitive dysfunction, leg weakness, and falls. An MRI showed significant disease progression. Patient: So what do we do now? Doctor: We've changed your treatment plan to palliative chemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate and rituximab. Your disease has responded well to this course of treatment. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all that you're doing for me. [/INST] S: The patient, a middle-aged individual, presented with worsening mental status, gait instability, and expressive aphasia. The patient reported difficulty walking and speaking. There is a history of a diagnosed right frontal lobe B-cell lymphoma with the MYD88L265P mutation, consistent with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). The patient has undergone various treatments, including rituximab, methylprednisolone, carfilzomib, and ibrutinib, with initial good response but subsequent disease progression. O: Physical examination confirmed expressive aphasia and gait instability. Vital signs were stable. Laboratory studies and urine drug screen were negative. Initial CT and MRI imaging revealed a 5.5-cm right frontoparietal lesion with features suggestive of malignancy. Further testing confirmed elevated IgM monoclonal paraprotein. Recent MRI indicated significant disease progression despite previous treatment response. Current treatment includes high-dose methotrexate and rituximab for palliative purposes. A: Primary diagnosis is Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia with central nervous system involvement, evidenced by B-cell lymphoma in the right frontal lobe. Differential diagnosis initially included other forms of central nervous system lymphomas or malignancies. The prognosis is guarded due to recent disease progression and complications such as thrombocytopenia leading to treatment modification. P: Continue with palliative chemotherapy regimen of high-dose methotrexate and rituximab. Monitor hematologic parameters closely due to previous thrombocytopenia. Schedule regular MRI scans to assess disease progression or response to treatment. Provide supportive care for symptoms of gait instability and expressive aphasia, including physical therapy and speech therapy. Educate the patient and family about the nature of the disease, treatment expectations, and potential complications. Ensure psychological support is available to help cope with the diagnosis and treatment side effects. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, I see that you've presented here today with a history of pallor. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, my daughter has been looking pale for about a week now. Doctor: I understand that she was previously at a referral hospital where she received a red blood cell transfusion for severe anemia. Her hemoglobin level was 3.4 g/dL, which is quite low. Patient: Yes, that's correct. They started treating her for iron-deficiency anemia after they confirmed microcytosis, hypochromia, and low serum iron. Doctor: Right, her mean corpuscular volume was 74.6 fl and her mean cell hemoglobin was 21.5 pg, with a serum iron concentration of 1.28 umol/L. She was discharged after 1 week of treatment and her anemia was corrected, with her hemoglobin level at 12.4 g/dL. However, she had recurrent anemia over the next six months despite receiving another red blood cell transfusion. Patient: Yes, that's right. She also had some positive fecal occult blood test results intermittently. Doctor: I see. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed an increase in patch density in her left lower lobe (Fig. a) and right upper lobe (Fig. b) of her lung. She didn't have a history of repetitive haemoptysis, chronic cough, or dyspnoea, so idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis (IPH) was considered and her iron-deficiency anemia therapy was discontinued. Patient: So, she was referred here for further management. What's the plan now? Doctor: We performed a flexible bronchoscopy, but the bronchoalveolar lavage examination of blood-stained fluid and hemosiderin-laden macrophages from the involved areas was negative. A review of her chest CT scan showed no extensive ground glass opacities or reticular shadows, so diffuse alveolar haemorrhage was ruled out. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We also reviewed your daughter's history and found an episode of intermittent melena one month after the IDA treatment. The outpatient doctor thought it might be a side effect of the drug. Does your family have any related genetic history? Patient: No, we don't have any genetic history like that. Doctor: Okay, that's good to know. The physical exam demonstrated a girl of normal appearance, consistent with her ethnicity, except for the pallor. We decided to start a diagnostic approach for gastrointestinal bleeding. Patient: What does that involve? Doctor: Your daughter underwent both upper and lower endoscopy, but we found negative findings in all of the endoscopic examinations. We also performed a plain and enhanced CT of her abdomen and a technetium-99 scan. Patient: So, what are the results? [/INST] S: The patient, a young girl, presented with a chief complaint of pallor persisting for about a week. She has a history of severe iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) treated with red blood cell transfusions and iron supplements. Despite treatment, she experienced recurrent anemia and intermittent positive fecal occult blood tests. There is no reported family history of related genetic conditions. The patient's mother reports an episode of melena following IDA treatment, suspected to be a drug side effect. O: Previous lab results showed hemoglobin at 3.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 74.6 fl, mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) 21.5 pg, and serum iron 1.28 umol/L. Post-treatment hemoglobin improved to 12.4 g/dL. Recent imaging included a chest CT revealing increased patch density in the left lower and right upper lobes of the lung. Bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Upper and lower endoscopies, as well as abdominal CT and technetium-99 scans, showed no abnormalities. A: The primary diagnosis is recurrent iron-deficiency anemia with suspected gastrointestinal bleeding as a potential underlying cause. Differential diagnoses previously considered included idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, which was ruled out based on imaging and bronchoscopy results. The negative endoscopic examinations and imaging studies make the source of bleeding unclear, complicating the diagnosis. P: The management plan includes further investigation into the cause of the gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient will continue monitoring with regular complete blood counts (CBC) and iron studies to assess anemia status. A repeat fecal occult blood test is scheduled to confirm ongoing bleeding. Nutritional counseling will be provided to ensure adequate iron intake. A follow-up with a pediatric gastroenterologist is recommended for potential exploratory procedures if bleeding persists or anemia recurs. Patient and family education on signs of worsening anemia and when to seek immediate care will be emphasized. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I recently received a referral from your primary care physician regarding concerns about polycythemia. Can you tell me if you've been experiencing any unusual symptoms lately? Patient: Hmm, not really. I've been feeling okay. Doctor: I see. I understand you've recently started full masculinizing hormone therapy with transdermal testosterone gel, is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Your laboratory report showed that your hemoglobin is 168 g/L and hematocrit is 0.49, which are flagged as high based on female reference ranges. However, since you're on hormone therapy, we should actually be using the male reference ranges. For males, the hemoglobin reference range is 120-170g/L and hematocrit is 0.36-0.50. Patient: Oh, okay. So, what does that mean for me? Doctor: Androgens, like the testosterone you're taking, are known to stimulate erythropoiesis, which can result in an increase in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count. On the other hand, the impact of estrogens isn't as well understood. In trans individuals on feminizing hormone therapy with estradiol and anti-androgen, there's usually a significant decrease in hemoglobin and other blood parameters. Patient: I see. So, is this something I should be worried about? Doctor: It's worth noting that some studies suggest a higher hematocrit is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. This is probably more of a consideration for people using masculinizing hormone therapy like you. However, since you've just started the therapy, your serum hematocrit levels might still be adjusting. It's evident that serum hematocrit levels in the affirmed gender's range can be seen from 3 months after commencing gender-affirming hormone therapy. Patient: Alright. Is there anything else I should be doing? Doctor: As smoking can also increase hematocrit levels, I would recommend smoking cessation if you're a smoker. This will help in maintaining healthy hematocrit levels and reduce any potential risks. Patient: Got it. I don't smoke, but that's good to know. Doctor: That's great to hear. For now, we'll continue monitoring your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels using the male reference ranges since you're on masculinizing hormone therapy. If there are any concerns regarding your levels in the future, we will address them accordingly. Patient: Alright, thank you for the explanation. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care! [/INST] S: The patient, currently undergoing masculinizing hormone therapy with transdermal testosterone gel, reports no unusual symptoms and feels okay. The patient has been referred due to concerns about polycythemia. O: Laboratory results show hemoglobin at 168 g/L and hematocrit at 0.49. These levels are high based on female reference ranges but are within normal limits when considering male reference ranges (hemoglobin: 120-170 g/L, hematocrit: 0.36-0.50). The patient does not smoke. A: The patient's elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are likely influenced by the testosterone therapy, which stimulates erythropoiesis. Although these levels are currently within the male reference ranges, continuous monitoring is necessary due to the potential risk of cardiovascular disease associated with higher hematocrit levels, particularly in patients on masculinizing hormone therapy. P: Continue monitoring hemoglobin and hematocrit levels using male reference ranges. Educate the patient on the potential cardiovascular risks associated with higher hematocrit levels and the importance of maintaining healthy levels. Encourage the patient to remain non-smoker and to report any new symptoms or concerns. Schedule follow-up appointments to reassess blood levels and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that your son was diagnosed with Hirschsprung's disease at a very young age. Can you tell me about his medical history? Parent: Yes, doctor. He had a loop ileostomy when he was just 12 days old due to an intestinal perforation. Doctor: I see, and did he have any complications after that? Parent: When he was three months old, he had a prolapse of his ileostomy which needed a revision surgery. Doctor: That must have been difficult. How was his recovery after the revision? Parent: Well, two months after the laparotomy, he developed a prolonged course of watery diarrhea, malabsorption, and poor weight gain. Doctor: That's concerning. Did you try changing his diet or formula to see if it could be a food allergy? Parent: Yes, we suspected a cow's milk protein allergy, so we changed his formula, but it didn't improve his symptoms. Doctor: I understand. So, what happened next? Parent: At the age of seven months, the doctor decided to perform a pull-through procedure on him. Doctor: During the procedure, did they find any other issues? Parent: Yes, there was an ileocolic intussusception that was identified incidentally. Doctor: And how did they manage that? Parent: The doctor performed a manual reduction to fix the intussusception. Doctor: That's good to hear. So, how has his condition been since the reduction? Parent: His stool production and intestinal absorption have normalized after the reduction, thankfully. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. How has his postoperative recovery been so far? Parent: His postoperative course has been uneventful, and he seems to be doing much better now. Doctor: That's great news. Make sure to keep monitoring his progress and bring him in for regular check-ups. If you notice any changes or have concerns, don't hesitate to contact us. Parent: Thank you, doctor. We'll definitely keep an eye on him and make sure he stays healthy. [/INST] S: The patient, a young child, has a history of Hirschsprung's disease diagnosed shortly after birth. He underwent a loop ileostomy at 12 days old due to intestinal perforation and later required revision surgery for a prolapsed ileostomy at three months. The patient experienced persistent symptoms of watery diarrhea, malabsorption, and poor weight gain despite dietary modifications to address a suspected cow's milk protein allergy. At seven months, a pull-through procedure was performed, during which an ileocolic intussusception was incidentally discovered and manually reduced. O: Postoperatively, the patient's stool production and intestinal absorption normalized. The recovery following the latest surgery has been uneventful with significant improvement in symptoms. A: The primary diagnosis is Hirschsprung's disease with complications including intestinal perforation, ileostomy prolapse, and ileocolic intussusception. The successful management of the intussusception and stabilization post-pull-through procedure indicate a positive response to surgical interventions. P: Continue regular pediatric follow-ups to monitor the patient's development and intestinal function. Educate the parents on signs of potential complications and encourage immediate consultation if new symptoms arise. Ensure nutritional support is optimized to promote growth and development. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've had orthodontic treatment for 3 years, but I'm still not happy with my teeth. They're angled wrong and stick out too much. Doctor: I see. Let's take a look and see what's going on. Hmm, I can see that your facial analysis shows a convex profile and mandibular asymmetry, with deviation to the right side. This probably caused the asymmetry on your upper arch. Your midline also has a 3-mm deviation compared to your facial midline, with angulation of the anterior teeth to the right side. Patient: Oh, really? That doesn't sound good. Doctor: Don't worry, we can still correct this. The analysis of your intraoral photographs shows a Class I relationship on both sides. One of the treatment options we can consider is extracting four premolars. This would address most of the issues with your teeth. However, it wouldn't correct the occlusal plane canting. Patient: Hmm, I don't think I want extractions. I'm worried about the spaces that would be created before they close with orthodontic mechanics. Doctor: I understand your concern. In that case, we can consider using skeletal anchorage to level the occlusal plane and create spaces to reduce the projection of your incisors and eliminate crowding in your lower arch. Patient: That sounds better. What does it involve? Doctor: We would bond standard Edgewise brackets with 0.022 × 0.028-in slots to your upper and lower arches, except for the lower incisors. Then, we would use different archwires to align and level your teeth, from 0.012 and 0.014-in nickel-titanium archwires up to rectangular 0.019 × 0.025-in archwires. Patient: Okay, and what about the skeletal anchorage? Doctor: We would position four miniplates, one in each posterior region of your quadrants. Next, we would start the intrusion on the left side of your upper arch by connecting elastomeric chains directly from the miniplate to the arch. This would apply a force of 200 g/f. Patient: How long would that take? Doctor: After about one month, we would start the retraction of both arches with elastics connected from the miniplates to hooks. The entire process may take some time, but it should help correct your teeth's angulation and crowding issues. Patient: Alright, let's go for it. I just want to feel confident about my smile again. Doctor: I understand, and I'm confident we can help you achieve the results you're looking for. Let's get started, and we'll monitor your progress along the way. [/INST] S: The patient reports dissatisfaction with the outcome of a 3-year orthodontic treatment, noting that the teeth are incorrectly angled and protrude excessively. The patient expresses a preference against extraction due to concerns about the resultant spaces. O: Facial analysis indicates a convex profile and right-sided mandibular asymmetry, contributing to upper arch asymmetry and a 3-mm deviation of dental midline from the facial midline. Intraoral photographs reveal a Class I relationship on both sides. The patient's occlusal plane canting remains unaddressed by potential extraction. A: The primary diagnosis is dental malocclusion with specific issues including mandibular asymmetry, midline deviation, and occlusal plane canting. Differential diagnosis could consider underlying skeletal discrepancies contributing to the malocclusion. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic with appropriate orthodontic intervention. P: The treatment plan includes the application of standard Edgewise brackets with 0.022 × 0.028-in slots on upper and lower arches, excluding lower incisors, and the use of varying sizes of nickel-titanium archwires for alignment and leveling. Skeletal anchorage will be employed using four miniplates for intrusion and retraction of arches, with an initial force of 200 g/f applied via elastomeric chains. The patient will be monitored regularly to assess progress and adjust treatment as necessary. Education on the expected duration and stages of treatment will be provided to manage expectations and encourage compliance. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see that you were diagnosed with carcinoma of the sigmoid colon. You had a laparoscopic left hemicolectomy done back in early September 2016. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: The pathology report revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The tumor involved per-colic tissue, and one out of 14 regional lymph nodes was positive. Fortunately, all resection margins were clear. This puts you at a stage III disease.  Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We planned to give you a course of adjuvant chemotherapy with CAPEOX, which consists of capecitabine and oxaliplatin, for eight cycles. The aim is to achieve a 10% absolute gain in 8-year overall survival. Your first cycle started in late October 2016.  Patient: Yes, I remember that. Doctor: On Day 13 of the treatment, you developed a fever and grade 3-4 diarrhea. We had to withhold the day 14 capecitabine. You were then admitted to the hospital through the Emergency Department. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: I was feeling really weak and had high fever. The diarrhea was terrible too. Doctor: I see. Your complete blood count showed that you had grade 4 marrow suppression toxicity. Your total white blood cell count was 0.52 × 10∧9/L, your neutrophil count was 0.04 × 10∧9/L, and your platelet count was 25 × 10∧9/L. All of these are well below the normal ranges. Patient: That sounds bad. Doctor: Yes, it is concerning. We had to give you intravenous antibiotics, specifically piperacillin/tazobactam, and growth factors for your neutropenic fever. You were hospitalized for 3 weeks before being discharged. How have you been feeling since then? Patient: I've been feeling better since I got out of the hospital, but still not great. Doctor: Given the stormy side effects of chemotherapy you experienced, we are highly suspicious that you may have a deficiency in DPD, which makes it difficult for your body to process the chemotherapy drugs. We'll need to do further tests to confirm this. Patient: Okay, what do I need to do? Doctor: We'll schedule further tests to confirm the DPD deficiency, and based on the results, we may need to adjust your chemotherapy regimen. In the meantime, please continue to monitor your symptoms and let us know if anything changes. Patient: Alright, thank you, Doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, previously diagnosed with stage III moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon, underwent a laparoscopic left hemicolectomy in September 2016. Post-surgery, the patient started adjuvant chemotherapy with CAPEOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) in October 2016. On Day 13 of treatment, the patient developed a fever and grade 3-4 diarrhea, leading to hospitalization due to severe symptoms including weakness and high fever. O: Pathology reports confirmed tumor involvement in per-colic tissue and one out of 14 regional lymph nodes positive with clear resection margins. During chemotherapy, the patient exhibited grade 4 marrow suppression toxicity with critical reductions in white blood cell count (0.52 × 10^9/L), neutrophil count (0.04 × 10^9/L), and platelet count (25 × 10^9/L). The patient was treated with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam and growth factors for neutropenic fever and was hospitalized for three weeks. A: The primary diagnosis is stage III adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon, post-surgical and post-initial chemotherapy cycle complications including severe marrow suppression and suspected DPD deficiency, which could be contributing to the adverse reactions to chemotherapy. P: Plan to conduct further tests to confirm suspected DPD deficiency. Depending on the results, adjustments to the chemotherapy regimen may be necessary. Continue monitoring the patient's symptoms closely and provide supportive care as needed. Educate the patient on the importance of reporting new or worsening symptoms promptly. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented to our institution with a complaint of an increasing abdominal mass and pollakiuria for approximately 2 months prior to this consultation. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, I've noticed that this mass in my abdomen has been getting bigger, and I've been experiencing frequent urination for the past two months. Doctor: Alright. Do you have any chronic medical conditions or have you had any surgeries in the past? Patient: No, I don't have any chronic conditions and I've never had any surgeries. Doctor: Have you been exposed to any carcinogenic substances, alcohol, tobacco, or drugs? Patient: No, I've never been exposed to any of those. Doctor: Are you married and do you have any children? Patient: Yes, I am married and have four children. Doctor: Thank you for the information. During the physical examination, we found that you have a blood pressure of 128/82 mmHg, heart rate at 78 beats per minute, and a temperature of 37.4 °C. We also noticed a firm, non-tender, non-mobile, hypogastric mass projecting approximately 20 cm above the pubic symphysis. Additionally, we found that you have only one testis in the right scrotum, with the contralateral scrotum and inguinal canal being empty. There were no palpable inguinal lymph nodes or ascites. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We also performed a neurological assessment and found conserved muscle forces and sensitivity in all four limbs, with all reflexes being conserved. Paraclinical investigations revealed no hematuria and proteinuria on urine analysis, normal white cell and platelet count on the full blood count, no blast cells on the blood smear, and a negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology. Patient: That's good to know. Doctor: A pelvic ultrasound was also done, and it revealed a heterogeneous bean-shaped mass lying above your bladder, approximately 10 cm by 7 cm in size, with five smaller satellite masses. Your kidneys, bladder, and bowels had no abnormalities. Given these findings, our probable diagnosis is enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It means that there is a possibility that you have enlarged lymph nodes in the abdominal region. To further investigate this, we scheduled an exploratory laparotomy for you. Patient: What happened during the laparotomy? Doctor: During the exploratory laparotomy, we found a highly vascularized mass fixed to the left inguinal ligament, projecting into the retroperitoneum, with several other small satellite masses attached posteriorly. Patient: What does this mean for me? Doctor: We will further analyze the findings and discuss the appropriate treatment options with you. It is important to continue monitoring your symptoms and follow up with us as needed. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything. [/INST] S: The patient, a married individual with four children, presents with a chief complaint of an enlarging abdominal mass and frequent urination (pollakiuria) for the past two months. The patient denies any chronic medical conditions, previous surgeries, or exposure to carcinogenic substances, alcohol, tobacco, or drugs. O: Physical examination reveals a blood pressure of 128/82 mmHg, heart rate of 78 bpm, and a temperature of 37.4 °C. A firm, non-tender, non-mobile, hypogastric mass approximately 20 cm above the pubic symphysis is noted. The patient has unilateral cryptorchidism with an empty left scrotum and inguinal canal. No inguinal lymph nodes or ascites are palpable. Neurological assessment shows preserved muscle strength and sensitivity, with all reflexes intact. Urine analysis is negative for hematuria and proteinuria. Full blood count and blood smear are within normal limits, and HIV serology is negative. Pelvic ultrasound reveals a heterogeneous bean-shaped mass above the bladder, measuring 10 cm by 7 cm, with five smaller satellite masses. Kidneys, bladder, and bowels appear normal. Exploratory laparotomy identified a highly vascularized mass fixed to the left inguinal ligament, projecting into the retroperitoneum, with several small satellite masses attached posteriorly. A: The primary diagnosis is a highly vascularized retroperitoneal mass with satellite masses, likely representing a malignant neoplasm, given its characteristics and rapid growth. Differential diagnoses include benign mesenteric lymphadenopathy or a germ cell tumor, considering the patient's unilateral cryptorchidism and abdominal mass location. P: The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy for further investigation, and tissue samples were likely obtained for histopathological examination to confirm the diagnosis. The management plan will include discussing the histopathology results, determining the specific type of malignancy, and outlining appropriate treatment options such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, depending on the final diagnosis. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient's progress and manage any complications. Patient education regarding the diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis will be provided to ensure understanding and compliance. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I'm here to report the case of a 91-year-old woman who developed a generalized maculopapular skin eruption after using icodextrin dialysate solutions for CAPD. Can you tell me about your medical history? Patient: Yes, doctor. I have stage IV congestive heart failure according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, secondary to massive tricuspid valve failure and severe mitral valve deficiency. I also have chronic atrial fibrillation (cAF) and stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate (eGFR) of 20 ml/min/1.73m2. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that you had a Tenckhoff peritoneal catheter surgically inserted recently. Can you tell me about your experience during your prolonged hospitalization in the Peritoneal Dialysis Unit? Patient: Yes, I was in the hospital for a while because there was leakage from the peritoneal catheter exit site. I was eventually discharged, and my CAPD regimen included 2 icodextrin exchanges per day. Doctor: That's correct. The daily dose of icodextrin relative to your body weight was 41.7 ml/kg, and the peritoneal ultrafiltration volume was 600 ml/day. You were then re-evaluated 7 days later, and the CAPD regimen was intensified with the addition of another exchange during the day with dialysate glucose 1.36%. This resulted in a peritoneal ultrafiltration of approximately 800 ml/day. Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: On Day 15 after your initial exposure to icodextrin, you were admitted to the Peritoneal Dialysis Unit due to a widespread maculopapular and exfoliative skin rash extending over your abdomen, arms, legs, and back. Can you describe how the rash looked and felt? Patient: It was a sudden skin rash that was red and bumpy, covering a large area of my body. It was very itchy and uncomfortable. Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. During your admission, we conducted a physical examination. Your normal body temperature was 36.7 °C, blood pressure 105/60 mmHg, pulse rate 70 bpm, oxygen saturation 95% in the room air, and there was an absence of abnormal clinical signs from the chest auscultation and palpation of the abdomen. Patient: Okay, so what's the next step, doctor? Doctor: We will continue to closely monitor your condition and adjust your CAPD regimen as needed to minimize the risk of further skin eruptions. It's important that you report any new symptoms or changes in your health to your healthcare team promptly. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to keep you updated on my condition. [If the patient eventually dies, the conversation could continue with the patient's family:] Doctor: I'm very sorry to inform you that your loved one has passed away. We did everything we could to treat her condition and manage her symptoms, but unfortunately, her health continued to decline. Please accept my deepest condolences. Family: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate all the efforts you and your team made to care for her. [/INST] S: A 91-year-old female patient with a history of stage IV congestive heart failure (NYHA classification), massive tricuspid valve failure, severe mitral valve deficiency, chronic atrial fibrillation, and stage 4 chronic kidney disease (eGFR 20 ml/min/1.73m2) reports a generalized maculopapular skin eruption following the use of icodextrin dialysate solutions for CAPD. She describes the rash as sudden, red, bumpy, itchy, and uncomfortable, covering her abdomen, arms, legs, and back. O: The patient had a Tenckhoff peritoneal catheter surgically inserted, with a CAPD regimen of 2 icodextrin exchanges per day, later intensified with an additional exchange using dialysate glucose 1.36%. On physical examination, vital signs were stable with a body temperature of 36.7 °C, blood pressure 105/60 mmHg, pulse rate 70 bpm, and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. No abnormal clinical signs were noted from chest auscultation and abdominal palpation. A: The primary diagnosis is a drug-induced skin eruption secondary to icodextrin use in a patient with multiple comorbidities including advanced heart and kidney disease. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of dermatitis or allergic reactions unrelated to drug use. P: The management plan includes close monitoring of the patient's condition and adjustment of the CAPD regimen to minimize the risk of further skin eruptions. The patient is advised to promptly report any new symptoms or changes in her health. Further consultations with a dermatologist and possibly an allergist may be necessary to manage the skin condition and assess for potential allergens. Regular follow-ups in the Peritoneal Dialysis Unit will be scheduled to monitor her condition and treatment efficacy. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see from your history that you're a 70-year-old woman with B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL). Can you tell me more about your recent symptoms? Patient: Yes, over the past few weeks, I've had progressive right upper extremity weakness and increasing confusion. Doctor: Have you had any prior cardiac surgery or known cardiac abnormalities? Patient: No, I haven't. Doctor: Okay. During your physical exam, we found that you have normal cardiac findings, 3/5 strength in your right arm, you were afebrile, and your white cell count was elevated at > 170 × 103/μL, which is at your baseline. We focused our initial workup on your neurologic complaints. We conducted a brain MRI, which revealed multiple bilateral rim-enhancing brain lesions with surrounding vasogenic edema. The differential diagnosis included embolic or metastatic lesions, with a high suspicion for metastatic disease given your presentation and history. Patient: Oh, that sounds concerning. Doctor: Yes, we needed to determine the cause of these lesions. We conducted a workup for primary malignancy which came back negative. You then underwent a right craniotomy for biopsy. The resected lesion contained necrotic tissue with branching fungal hyphae suggestive of Aspergillus. Tissue cultures revealed Aspergillus Fumigatus species. Patient: What's the treatment for that? Doctor: We started you on IV Voraconazole (6 mg/kg every 12 h day 1 then 4 mg/kg every 12 h) and Micafungin (100 mg daily). The Galactomannan assay was positive, but all blood cultures were negative. Patient: Okay, so what's next? Doctor: We performed a 2D echocardiogram to evaluate for a possible embolic source for the brain abscesses. This revealed a 1.3 × 1.1 cm pedunculated mass in the inferior wall of the left ventricle. There was no evidence of any cardiac dysfunction, and your LV ejection fraction was measured at 55%. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: We needed to consult cardiac surgery to remove the mass. You underwent a median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass for removal of the left ventricular mass using a left atriotomy incision. The mitral valve was inspected through the incision and demonstrated no vegetations. A retractor was placed through the mitral valve, and the left ventricular mass was easily identified and removed. Patient: So, the mass is gone now? Doctor: Yes, it was a 1 cm soft, smooth appearing mass found adhered to the inferior septal portion of the left ventricle. The surgery was successful in removing it. Patient: That's a relief. What are the next steps for my care? Doctor: We will continue monitoring you and treating the Aspergillus infection. You'll need to keep taking the prescribed medications and follow up with us regularly to ensure your recovery proceeds smoothly. [/INST] S: The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL) presenting with progressive right upper extremity weakness and increasing confusion over the past few weeks. She denies any history of cardiac surgery or known cardiac abnormalities. O: Physical examination revealed normal cardiac findings, 3/5 strength in the right arm, and the patient was afebrile. White cell count was elevated at > 170 × 10^3/μL, consistent with her baseline. Brain MRI showed multiple bilateral rim-enhancing brain lesions with surrounding vasogenic edema. A right craniotomy and biopsy identified necrotic tissue with branching fungal hyphae suggestive of Aspergillus, confirmed by tissue cultures as Aspergillus Fumigatus. IV Voraconazole and Micafungin were initiated. Galactomannan assay was positive; blood cultures were negative. A 2D echocardiogram revealed a 1.3 × 1.1 cm pedunculated mass in the inferior wall of the left ventricle, with an LV ejection fraction of 55%. Cardiac surgery removed the mass successfully. A: The primary diagnosis is cerebral aspergillosis secondary to Aspergillus fumigatus infection, with a differential diagnosis of embolic or metastatic brain lesions initially considered. The patient also had a cardiac mass, which was surgically excised and found to be non-malignant. P: Continue IV antifungal therapy with Voraconazole and Micafungin. Regular monitoring of the patient's neurological status and white cell count is necessary. Follow-up appointments for cardiac function assessment post-surgery and to monitor response to antifungal treatment. Educate the patient on signs of potential complications and ensure adherence to the medication regimen. Regular follow-ups in hematology and infectious disease clinics are recommended. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I understand you were admitted to the emergency department after a sudden cardiac arrest at home. Can you tell me what happened? Patient: Yes, I suddenly collapsed at home and my family called 911. They performed CPR and I was resuscitated. Doctor: I see. After the resuscitation, we recorded your heart rhythm which showed ventricular fibrillation. Due to respiratory insufficiency, we had to intubate you and set up mechanical ventilation. We also performed an Electrocardiography which revealed ST-segment depressions up to 1 mm in I, aVL, II, III, and V1-4 leads. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What does that mean? Doctor: It indicates some abnormalities in your heart rhythm and function. When you were transported to the emergency department, you were hemodynamically stable and had preserved systolic blood pressure without the need for inotropes. Patient: That's good to know. So, what happened next? Doctor: We performed blood tests and found an elevated level of serum D-dimers, which led us to perform computed tomography of your head and chest in a pulmonary embolism algorithm. It showed signs of cerebral stroke and evident pulmonary embolism. Patient: Oh no, that's terrible. Doctor: Yes, it is concerning. The chest radiograph also depicted features of pulmonary edema. At that time, we requested a cardiological consultation, and the cardiologist ordered an echocardiography at your bedside. Patient: And what did that show? Doctor: The echocardiography revealed impaired left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) of about 25-30%, regional contractility impairment with recent akinesis of the lateral, inferior, and posterior walls, hypokinesis of other walls, and moderate mitral regurgitation. Patient: That sounds complicated. What does it mean for me? Doctor: It means that your heart function is significantly impaired, which could have contributed to your cardiac arrest. Based on these findings, you were immediately qualified for coronary artery angiography and transferred from the emergency department to the catheterization laboratory (CathLab). Patient: What happened during the transportation? Doctor: During the transportation to the CathLab, the first symptoms of cardiogenic shock (CS) developed, and you were given the first inotrope—noradrenaline. Patient: What did the angiography show? Doctor: The coronary artery angiography revealed multivessel disease including a recessive right coronary artery with 60% stenosis, left main coronary artery without significant stenoses, ostial occlusion of the dominant circumflex branch (Cx), left anterior descending artery (LAD) with multiple significant stenoses, and intermediate branch with 80-90% ostial stenosis. Patient: What does that mean for my treatment? Doctor: Based on these findings, you will require percutaneous coronary intervention to help improve blood flow to your heart and prevent further complications. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, who experienced a sudden cardiac arrest at home, was resuscitated by family members performing CPR. The patient reports collapsing suddenly prior to the incident. O: Upon admission, the patient's heart rhythm showed ventricular fibrillation. Electrocardiography indicated ST-segment depressions up to 1 mm in I, aVL, II, III, and V1-4 leads. The patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory insufficiency. Hemodynamically stable upon arrival with preserved systolic blood pressure. Elevated serum D-dimers prompted CT scans, revealing cerebral stroke and pulmonary embolism. Chest radiograph showed pulmonary edema. Echocardiography revealed an impaired left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30%, regional contractility impairment, and moderate mitral regurgitation. Coronary artery angiography indicated multivessel disease with significant stenoses in multiple arteries. A: The primary diagnosis is cardiogenic shock secondary to acute myocardial infarction, complicated by multivessel coronary artery disease, cerebral stroke, and pulmonary embolism. Differential diagnoses include primary arrhythmia leading to cardiac arrest. P: Immediate management included mechanical ventilation, inotropic support with noradrenaline, and percutaneous coronary intervention. Ongoing treatment will involve cardiological and neurological monitoring, anticoagulation therapy, and rehabilitation. Patient education on heart health, lifestyle modifications, and adherence to prescribed medications is crucial. Referrals to cardiology and neurology for specialized care are planned. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi doctor, I've been having intermittent diarrhea for the past 4 months and significant weight loss. Doctor: I see. You mentioned you're a 70-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and you received a kidney transplant in 2011, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. I've been on tacrolimus, prednisone, and mycophenolate since then. Doctor: Okay, let's review your recent tests. Your creatinine level at presentation was 3.4 mg/dL, up from a baseline of 1.2 mg/dL on prior studies. We found a positive stool infectious panel PCR for norovirus during your inpatient hospital evaluation. Clostridium difficile study was negative, and your fecal fat content was within normal limits.  Patient: Hmm, so what does that mean? Doctor: It means that you have an infection with norovirus, which might be causing your symptoms. We decided to discontinue your mycophenolate medication as it could be contributing to your symptoms as a side effect. We started you on azathioprine for immunosuppression instead. Patient: Yes, I remember that. But my symptoms didn't really improve much. Doctor: Right. So, we treated you with a 3-day course of 500 mg PO nitazoxanide twice daily, which showed modest improvement. However, your symptoms reoccurred, and we decided to give you a second, longer course of nitazoxanide for 3 weeks. Patient: And my symptoms did resolve within a week of that treatment, but they came back again in the following 3 months. Doctor: Yes, we noticed that your stool biofire PCRs were persistently positive for norovirus when checked monthly over the following 5-month time period. That's when we decided to start you on a 3-week course of high-dose nitazoxanide (500 mg PO every eight hours). Patient: Oh, I remember that. It was difficult to tolerate due to gastrointestinal distress. Doctor: Yes, we then decreased the frequency of administration to twice daily, and you completed the three weeks of nitazoxanide treatment. Your gastrointestinal symptoms have since resolved. Patient: Yes, I've been feeling much better and haven't had any issues since then. Doctor: That's great to hear. We did a repeat stool PCR for norovirus 10 days after completion of therapy, and it was negative. You're now considered asymptomatic, which is a good sign. Patient: That's a relief. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. It's essential to monitor your health closely, especially considering your medical history of ESRD and the kidney transplant. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you experience any symptoms or have concerns in the future. Patient: I will, thank you for all your help. [/INST] S: The patient, a 70-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to streptococcal glomerulonephritis and a kidney transplant recipient in 2011, reports intermittent diarrhea and significant weight loss over the past 4 months. She is on tacrolimus, prednisone, and was on mycophenolate, which was recently switched to azathioprine. She mentions that despite treatment changes and interventions, her symptoms had temporarily improved but recurred. O: The patient's creatinine level increased to 3.4 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.2 mg/dL. A stool infectious panel PCR was positive for norovirus, and Clostridium difficile study was negative. Fecal fat content was normal. She completed a 3-week course of high-dose nitazoxanide (500 mg PO every eight hours, later adjusted to twice daily due to gastrointestinal distress), after which her gastrointestinal symptoms resolved. A repeat stool PCR for norovirus was negative 10 days post-therapy. A: The primary diagnosis is a persistent norovirus infection, likely exacerbated by immunosuppression due to her medical history and medications. Differential diagnoses could have included other causes of chronic diarrhea such as medication side effects or C. difficile infection, but these were ruled out through testing and clinical improvement following specific treatment for norovirus. P: The patient will continue with the current regimen of immunosuppressants and should monitor for any recurrence of symptoms. Regular follow-ups should be scheduled to monitor her kidney function and overall health, considering her history of ESRD and kidney transplantation. Education on hygiene and infection control is crucial due to her immunocompromised state. She is advised to reach out immediately if symptoms recur or new symptoms appear. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing epigastric pain for the past three years, and it's been getting worse in the last six months. I also feel nauseous after eating fatty foods. Doctor: I see. Let's start by doing a complete blood count and some other tests to understand what might be causing your symptoms. Patient: Okay, sure. *After tests* Doctor: Your test results show that your white blood count is 9550 cells/mm3, which is within the normal range of 4600–10200 cells/mm3, and your hematocrit level is 38%, which is slightly below the normal range of 40%–54%. Your electrolytes, liver function tests, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels are all normal. Patient: Alright, so what does that mean? Doctor: It means that we need to investigate further to find the cause of your symptoms. I'd like to perform an abdominal ultrasonography to get a better look at your internal organs. Patient: Okay, let's do that. *After ultrasonography* Doctor: The ultrasonography detected a 7-mm polyp in your gallbladder. This could be the reason for your epigastric pain and nausea. Patient: Oh, I see. What do you suggest we do next? Doctor: Considering your symptoms and the presence of the polyp, I recommend that you undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is a minimally invasive surgery to remove your gallbladder. Patient: If that's what you think is best, then let's do it. *After the surgery* Doctor: The surgery went well, and we were able to remove your gallbladder without any complications. You'll be discharged on the first postoperative day. Patient: That's great news. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. The pathologic examination of the removed gallbladder showed an 8-mm polyp, which included mononuclear cell infiltration consistent with chronic cholecystitis, thickening in the gallbladder wall, fibrosis, and 6x4 mm heterotopic pancreatic tissue located in the submucosal area of the fundus. Patient: So, what does that mean for me? Doctor: It means that the polyp and the associated changes in your gallbladder were likely the cause of your epigastric pain and nausea. Removing the gallbladder should help alleviate your symptoms. Patient: That's a relief to hear. What's the plan for follow-up? Doctor: We will schedule a three-month follow-up to ensure that there are no further complications and that your symptoms have improved. Patient: Sounds good. Thank you so much for your help, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. [/INST] S: The patient reported experiencing epigastric pain for the past three years, worsening over the last six months. The pain is associated with nausea after consuming fatty foods. O: The patient's complete blood count revealed a white blood count of 9550 cells/mm3 (normal range: 4600–10200 cells/mm3) and a hematocrit level of 38% (normal range: 40%–54%). Electrolytes, liver function tests, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels were all within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasonography detected a 7-mm polyp in the gallbladder. Postoperative findings confirmed an 8-mm polyp with chronic cholecystitis, gallbladder wall thickening, fibrosis, and heterotopic pancreatic tissue in the gallbladder fundus. A: The primary diagnosis is chronic cholecystitis associated with a gallbladder polyp, which was likely causing the patient's epigastric pain and nausea. The differential diagnosis could have included other causes of epigastric pain such as peptic ulcer disease or pancreatitis, but these were less likely given the imaging and surgical findings. P: The patient underwent a successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy to remove the gallbladder, which resolved the immediate cause of the symptoms. The patient will be discharged on the first postoperative day with instructions for post-surgical care. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in three months to monitor recovery and ensure no further complications. The patient was advised to reach out if any concerns or questions arise before the follow-up. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you've brought in your intact female Jack Russel terrier due to some severe neck pain and ataxia. Can you tell me more about what happened? Patient's owner: Yes, she had an altercation with a porcupine about 2 weeks ago. The vet removed several quills from her mouth and around her mandible. Doctor: I see. Were there any quills that penetrated deeper or caused more serious issues? Patient's owner: Well, one quill penetrated her soft palate, and two more were imbedded in her oropharynx. Doctor: That must have been quite painful for her. How has she been since the incident? Patient's owner: She's been in so much pain at times that she would only move her eyes. And she's been having trouble with balance and movement. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's take a closer look at her. *examines the dog* She's presenting with ataxia and weakness, especially on her right side. When I manipulate her neck, it's painful in all directions, but more so to the right side. The neuro-localisation indicates a right-sided lesion between C1 and C5. Patient's owner: What does that mean, exactly? Doctor: It means that there's an issue with her nervous system, specifically in the area of her neck, which is causing her pain and difficulty moving. Patient's owner: And what about her overall health? Is there anything else we should be concerned about? Doctor: We've checked her clinical parameters, including routine haematology, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis. Everything is within normal limits at presentation, so there are no additional concerns at this time. Patient's owner: That's a relief. So what can we do to help her? Doctor: We will need to treat the lesion in her neck to alleviate her pain and improve her mobility. I'll discuss the best course of action with our specialist and get back to you as soon as possible. In the meantime, please keep an eye on her and let us know if her condition worsens. Patient's owner: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, an intact female Jack Russell Terrier, presented with severe neck pain and ataxia. The owner reports that the symptoms started following an altercation with a porcupine two weeks prior, during which several quills were removed from the dog's mouth and mandible area. One quill had penetrated the soft palate and two were embedded in the oropharynx. The patient has been experiencing significant pain, to the extent of being mostly immobile except for eye movements, and has shown difficulties with balance and movement. O: Physical examination revealed ataxia and pronounced weakness on the right side. Pain was elicited upon manipulation of the neck in all directions, notably more severe on the right, suggesting a right-sided lesion between cervical vertebrae C1 and C5. Routine haematology, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis were performed, with all results within normal limits. A: The primary diagnosis is a right-sided cervical lesion between C1 and C5, likely secondary to trauma from the porcupine quill penetration. This is causing severe pain and neurological deficits including ataxia and partial immobility. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of cervical pain such as intervertebral disc disease or infectious etiologies, but these are less likely given the history and current findings. P: The management plan will involve consultation with a veterinary neurology specialist to determine the best course of treatment for the cervical lesion. Pain management will be prioritized to alleviate the patient's discomfort and improve mobility. The owner will be instructed to monitor the dog closely and report any worsening of symptoms. Further diagnostic imaging may be considered by the specialist to better delineate the extent of the lesion and guide treatment. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been experiencing new onset dyspnea on exertion when walking just 50 feet for the past 3 weeks. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history? Patient: Sure. I have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation for about 2 months. I also have a complete atrioventricular block, and I had a permanent pacemaker placement a year before this presentation. Doctor: Thank you for the information. What medications are you currently taking? Patient: I'm on lisinopril, metoprolol, apixiban, and atorvastatin. Doctor: Okay, we've done some laboratory work-up, and it was mostly unremarkable except for a mild elevation of uric acid at 8.5 mg/dl. Your HIV status was checked and came back negative. We also performed a transthoracic echocardiography which revealed pericardial effusion with evidence of pericardial tamponade and right ventricular wall hypertrophy.  Patient: Oh, that sounds a bit concerning. Doctor: Yes, it is something that needs further investigation. We performed a pericardial window, and the pericardial fluid cytology was negative for any malignant cells. You were then discharged and referred to a heart failure specialist due to concerns of cardiac amyloidosis based on the right ventricular hypertrophy and conduction disease. Patient: What did the specialist find? Doctor: The specialist performed a cardiac MRI which showed a large mass involving the right ventricular (RV) lateral wall with a maximum thickness of 3 cm. The mass was hyperintense to myocardium on T2 and isointense on T1. The left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) calculated using the cardiac MRI was between 41-43%. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: A low ejection fraction suggests that your heart is not pumping as efficiently as it should be. Following this, a cardiac biopsy of the RV mass was performed using an endovascular approach via the right internal jugular vein in the cardiac catheterization lab, assisted by intracardiac echocardiography. Additional work-up included a coronary angiogram that showed the absence of obstructive coronary disease. Patient: What were the results of the biopsy? Doctor: The immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers on the mass were positive for CD45, CD20, PAX-5, BCL2, BCL6, and MUM-1 and negative for CD5, CD10, and cyclin D1. Ki-67 on the mass was 50-60%; EBER was negative along with FISH for MYC, BCL2, and BCL6. These findings indicate that you have diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, nongerminal center subtype. Patient: Oh, that's not good. What's the next step? Doctor: We performed a bone marrow biopsy as part of the staging work-up, and it was negative for any lymphoma involvement. Your treatment plan will be discussed with your oncologist who will guide you through the next steps. Patient: Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. I'll make an appointment with the oncologist as soon as possible. Doctor: You're welcome. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Take care.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of arterial hypertension, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus medicated with oral hypoglycemic agents, ischemic cardiopathology with stent placement, chronic kidney failure, and liver cirrhosis. You also had a liver transplant and suffered portal vein thrombosis requiring anticoagulation. What brings you in for a consultation today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been having some trouble over the last three days. I've been passing liquid stools and experiencing emesis. I haven't had any fever spikes though. Doctor: I see. Did you consult the emergency ward of our institution recently? Patient: Yes, I came to the emergency ward and was admitted. I was alert, and my AT was 130/64, heart rate was 108 beats per minute, and my SO2 was 97% on room air. Doctor: Alright, and how did you feel during the physical examination? Patient: During the examination, I was alert but tachypneic, and the doctor noticed my dry mucous membranes. Doctor: I have your admission laboratory results here. It seems that a ketonemia test was requested, and the result was positive. Given your clinical presentation, it appears that you were experiencing dehydration secondary to gastrointestinal losses and euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. Patient: Oh, I see. What was done to treat this? Doctor: Reanimation was started with crystalloids, a continuous insulin infusion pump, and the administration of intravenous bicarbonate to help correct the ketoacidosis. Patient: How long did it take for my condition to improve? Doctor: After 48 hours, you presented diabetic ketoacidosis resolution criteria, which means your condition improved significantly. Patient: That's good to hear. What should I do now to ensure I stay healthy? Doctor: It's important to keep managing your noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus with the appropriate oral hypoglycemic agents, as prescribed. Also, continue monitoring your blood pressure, heart rate, and blood sugar levels regularly. If you experience any similar symptoms in the future, consult your healthcare provider promptly. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll follow your advice and keep an eye on my health. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions in the future. [/INST] S: The patient, with a complex medical history including arterial hypertension, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, ischemic cardiopathology with stent placement, chronic kidney failure, and liver cirrhosis post liver transplant and portal vein thrombosis, reports experiencing liquid stools and emesis for the past three days without fever spikes. O: During a recent emergency ward admission, the patient was alert with arterial tension (AT) at 130/64 mmHg, heart rate at 108 bpm, and oxygen saturation (SO2) at 97% on room air. Physical examination revealed tachypnea and dry mucous membranes. Laboratory results indicated positive ketonemia. The patient was diagnosed with dehydration secondary to gastrointestinal losses and euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. A: The primary diagnosis is euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, likely triggered by acute gastrointestinal losses leading to dehydration. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of acute diarrhea and vomiting, such as infectious gastroenteritis, though the absence of fever makes this less likely. P: Treatment included rehydration with crystalloids, continuous insulin infusion, and intravenous bicarbonate administration. The patient showed improvement within 48 hours. Ongoing management should focus on strict monitoring and management of diabetes with oral hypoglycemic agents, regular monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose levels. The patient is advised to seek immediate medical attention if similar symptoms recur. Regular follow-ups with endocrinology and gastroenterology are recommended to manage underlying chronic conditions and prevent complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented with progressive, PG-like lesions on your left arm. Can you tell me how this happened? Patient: Yeah, I had a minor abrasive trauma in a playground accident. It's been getting worse since then. Doctor: I see. According to your medical history, you were diagnosed with LAD-1 at 18 months of age. Your CD18 expression level was 5-10%, which indicates a mild/moderate phenotype. Have you ever experienced any life-threatening wounds before? Patient: No, never. Doctor: Your most recent clinical course involved 3.5 weeks of IV antibiotics and multiple wound debridement procedures at a peripheral site. The lesions significantly expanded after debridement, consistent with PG-like wounds. You were then transferred to our tertiary center for better care. Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Our team here includes experts from pediatrics for general medical care and care coordination, immunology for directing immunosuppressive therapies, infectious disease for guiding culture-directed antibiotic and antifungal therapies, and plastic surgery for overseeing wound care, debridement, and acquisition of biopsies. Patient: That sounds comprehensive. Doctor: We performed a punch biopsy on the central wound, and the histology demonstrated necrosis, focal superficial ulceration of the epidermis, and mixed inflammatory infiltrate including histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, and focal neutrophils. Interestingly, there was a lack of dermal neutrophilia, which is consistent with PG-like disease. Patient: Hmm, I see. Doctor: To treat this, we've initiated systemic therapy consisting of prednisone (1 mg/kg/d), cyclosporine (goal trough level 100-200 ng/mL), and intravenous immunoglobulin (1 g/kg every 2 weeks). We also treated the wounds empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem (500 mg IV q8h) and vancomycin (500 mg IV q12h). Patient: Okay. Doctor: On day 104, a tissue culture obtained during debridement showed a deep infection with Fusarium, an invasive fungal infection typically occurring in immunocompromised patients. This corresponded to clinical worsening and elevation in your C-reactive protein levels. Patient: Oh no, that's not good. Doctor: We initially treated the infection with dual liposomal amphotericin (10 mg/kg/d IV) and voriconazole (9 mg/kg/dose IV q12). However, we have now stepped down to liposomal amphotericin alone. We'll continue to monitor your progress closely. Patient: I appreciate the care you're providing. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to help you recover. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of LAD-1 diagnosed at 18 months and mild/moderate phenotype (CD18 expression 5-10%), presented with progressive, pyoderma gangrenosum (PG)-like lesions on the left arm following minor abrasive trauma in a playground accident. The patient denies any history of life-threatening wounds. O: The patient underwent multiple wound debridements and 3.5 weeks of IV antibiotics at a peripheral site, after which the lesions expanded, consistent with PG-like wounds. Histology from a punch biopsy showed necrosis, superficial ulceration, and mixed inflammatory infiltrate but lacked dermal neutrophilia. Recent tissue culture revealed a deep Fusarium infection. Current medications include prednisone (1 mg/kg/d), cyclosporine (goal trough level 100-200 ng/mL), intravenous immunoglobulin (1 g/kg every 2 weeks), meropenem (500 mg IV q8h), vancomycin (500 mg IV q12h), and liposomal amphotericin (10 mg/kg/d IV). C-reactive protein levels are elevated. A: The primary diagnosis is PG-like lesions secondary to LAD-1 with a complication of deep Fusarium infection. Differential diagnosis includes other causes of necrotic ulcers but is less likely given the patient's specific history and biopsy results. P: Continue current systemic therapy and antibiotic regimen. Step down antifungal treatment to liposomal amphotericin alone due to the Fusarium infection. Regular monitoring of infection status and adjustment of medications as needed. Coordination of care with pediatrics, immunology, infectious disease, and plastic surgery for comprehensive management. Educate the patient on signs of infection worsening and ensure adherence to the treatment regimen. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been experiencing some swelling in my left lower extremity. Doctor: I see. Let's perform some tests to find out the cause. We'll be in touch once we have the results. (After receiving the test results) Doctor: Hello again. Your tests revealed a large mass in your left iliac wing, and the biopsy of the bone lesion confirmed that you have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, specifically diffuse B-cell lymphoma. Patient: Oh no. What do we do now? Doctor: We will start you on a treatment plan consisting of 6 cycles of rituximab, Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Adriamycin (doxorubicin), vincristine (Oncovin), and prednisone, also known as CHOP. Patient: Okay, I understand. (After 8 months of treatment) Doctor: Your first post-treatment PET/CT scan shows a complete ""metabolic"" response, which is a good sign. Patient: That's a relief. (After 2 years) Doctor: Your second follow-up PET/CT scan after 2 years of completing therapy has demonstrated new mediastinal/hilar hypermetabolic adenopathy. The SUV max of the precarinal lymphadenopathy is 18.7, subcarinal lymphadenopathy is 26.3, and the right hilar lymph nodes is 24.6. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: We performed a biopsy of one of the lymph nodes, and it revealed non-caseating granulomatous inflammation. This doesn't seem to be cancer-related, but we'll continue to monitor it. (After another 2 years) Doctor: Your third follow-up PET/CT scan showed new abdominal hypermetabolic adenopathy with an SUV max of 8.7. Patient: Is that bad? Doctor: We will keep monitoring these findings, but you didn't need any additional therapy after the first follow-up PET/CT. (After 2 more years) Doctor: Your most recent follow-up PET/CT scan showed almost complete improvement of the previous findings. Patient: That's great news! Doctor: Yes, it is. The second to last follow-up PET/CTs were acquired to monitor SLR-related findings. There was a spontaneous resolution of FDG activity of these nodes, which means it wasn't a treatment-induced tumor response. Patient: So, what's next? Doctor: We'll continue to monitor your condition, but it seems like you're on the right track. Keep attending your follow-up appointments, and we'll make sure everything stays under control. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient reported initial swelling in the left lower extremity. Over time, the patient underwent treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, specifically diffuse B-cell lymphoma, and expressed concerns about subsequent findings on follow-up PET/CT scans. O: Initial tests revealed a large mass in the left iliac wing, confirmed as diffuse B-cell lymphoma via biopsy. Post-treatment PET/CT scans showed a complete metabolic response initially, but later scans revealed new mediastinal/hilar hypermetabolic adenopathy with high SUV max values (precarinal lymphadenopathy at 18.7, subcarinal lymphadenopathy at 26.3, and right hilar lymph nodes at 24.6). Biopsy of these nodes indicated non-caseating granulomatous inflammation, not related to cancer. Most recent PET/CT scan showed almost complete improvement of previous findings. A: Primary diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, specifically diffuse B-cell lymphoma, initially treated successfully with CHOP regimen. Subsequent findings of hypermetabolic adenopathy were monitored and showed spontaneous resolution, indicating non-malignant processes. P: Continue monitoring with regular follow-up PET/CT scans to ensure no recurrence of lymphoma and to assess any new adenopathy. Maintain current treatment plan of observation given the spontaneous resolution of recent findings. Educate patient on signs of recurrence and ensure compliance with follow-up schedules. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having some problems recently. I have a history of nasal bleeding from my left nostril, watering of my left eye, and nasal obstruction on and off. Doctor: I see. Let's perform an examination to see what might be causing these issues. Hmm, it looks like there's a mass in your left nasal cavity. We'll need to do some further tests to determine its nature. I'll order a computed tomography (CT) scan and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan for you. *After the CT and MRI scans* Doctor: Your scans revealed a heterogeneous soft tissue attenuation mass in your left anterior nasal cavity. It's causing erosion of the medial wall of your left maxillary sinus and has some irregular speculated calcification with a small, extra-osseous soft tissue component in the anterior deep subcutaneous tissue of your cheek. This mass is also causing the blockage of your left osteomeatal complex and the narrowing of your left inferior meatus. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does it mean? Doctor: We performed a biopsy of the mass to better understand its composition. The results showed that it's a small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC), which is a type of cancer. It tested strongly positive for cytokeratin (CK) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), moderately positive for CD-56 and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), but negative for p-63, CK-5/6, synaptophysin, chromogranin A, desmin, and p-40. Patient: So it's cancer? What's the next step? Doctor: Fortunately, there is no evidence of distant metastasis, meaning the cancer hasn't spread to other parts of your body. We will begin treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) using cisplatin and etoposide, along with a total radiotherapy (RT) dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions, delivered by the intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) technique. Patient: How does that work? Doctor: We will perform a CT-MRI fusion scan for target delineation, and the target coverage will be between 95% and 107% of the prescribed dose. The clinical target volume (CTV) high will be kept equal to the gross tumor volume (GTV) plus a margin of 7 mm, and the planning target volume (PTV) high will be kept equal to the CTV high plus a margin of 5 mm. Patient: And the chemotherapy? Doctor: You'll receive concurrent cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 on Days 1 to 3 in every three-weekly cycle. We'll monitor your progress with periodic CT scans. Patient: Alright, I understand. When do we start the treatment? Doctor: We'll begin as soon as possible. I'll have my team schedule your appointments and provide you with more information about the treatment process. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient reports a history of nasal bleeding from the left nostril, intermittent nasal obstruction, and watering of the left eye. O: Physical examination revealed a mass in the left nasal cavity. CT and MRI scans showed a heterogeneous soft tissue attenuation mass in the left anterior nasal cavity, causing erosion of the medial wall of the left maxillary sinus and blockage of the left osteomeatal complex. Biopsy confirmed small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC), strongly positive for CK and EMA, moderately positive for CD-56 and NSE, but negative for p-63, CK-5/6, synaptophysin, chromogranin A, desmin, and p-40. No evidence of distant metastasis was found. A: Primary diagnosis is small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC) of the left nasal cavity. Differential diagnoses could include other types of nasal cavity tumors, but biopsy results confirm SCNEC. The prognosis depends on response to treatment, with no current evidence of metastasis improving the outlook. P: Initiate concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) using cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 on Days 1 to 3 of each three-week cycle, with a total radiotherapy dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions delivered by IMRT. Plan includes CT-MRI fusion for target delineation with specific margins for CTV and PTV. Regular follow-up with CT scans to monitor treatment response.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that you've been hospitalized for several months due to bipolar disorder. What brings you here today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been experiencing atypical vaginal bleeding for over a year now, and it has worsened over time. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We will need to conduct some tests to find the cause of this bleeding.  (After running tests) Doctor: We conducted an abdominal CECT which showed a large pelvic mass. Given the complexity of your case, you were transferred to our institution for further evaluation. A pelvic MRI revealed a bulky mass in the whole uterine corpus, which has spread to the bladder and rectum. Additionally, chest and abdominal CECT revealed multiple lymph node metastases, extending from the para-aortic to pelvic lymph nodes. Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. Doctor: We also performed endometrial curettage, which showed atypical cells arranged in sheets with numerous mitotic figures. There was no sarcoma component, and the histological pattern indicated a carcinoma. ER and PR tumor cells were focally expressed.  Patient: What does that mean for me, Doctor? Doctor: As for tumor markers, we found elevated levels of CA19-9, CEA, and SCC (CA19-9 at 43 U/ml, CEA at 13.9 ng/ml, and SCC at 80.4 ng/ml). CA125 and CA72-4 levels were within normal range (CA125 at 12 U/ml and CA72-4 at 2.5 U/ml).  Patient: So, what's the diagnosis? Doctor: Although the pathological diagnosis remains uncertain, based on the overall findings, you have been diagnosed with stage IVA uterine endometrial cancer. Patient: That's terrible. What can we do about it? Doctor: Due to the presence of your mental disorder and poor general condition (performance status 4), the optimal treatment for you is best supportive care. Patient: I understand. What can I expect in terms of prognosis? Doctor: Unfortunately, the prognosis is not favorable. The patient in this case passed away three months after the diagnosis. The autopsy revealed uterine tumor invasion to the bladder, rectum, and pelvic wall with the involvement of the greater omentum and small intestine. Metastases to the pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes were observed. Microscopically, endometrioid carcinoma (grade 2) and undifferentiated carcinoma components were present. Pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3) was diffusely expressed in the differentiated carcinoma component and focally expressed in the undifferentiated carcinoma component. Patient's family member: Thank you for your honesty, Doctor. We will do our best to support her through this difficult time. [/INST] S: The patient, who has a history of bipolar disorder and has been hospitalized for several months, reports experiencing atypical vaginal bleeding for over a year, which has progressively worsened. O: Abdominal CECT and pelvic MRI revealed a large mass involving the whole uterine corpus, with extension to the bladder and rectum. Multiple lymph node metastases were noted from the para-aortic to pelvic lymph nodes. Endometrial curettage showed atypical cells arranged in sheets with numerous mitotic figures, indicative of carcinoma, without a sarcoma component. Tumor markers showed elevated CA19-9 at 43 U/ml, CEA at 13.9 ng/ml, and SCC at 80.4 ng/ml, while CA125 and CA72-4 were within normal limits. The patient's performance status was assessed as 4. A: The primary diagnosis is stage IVA uterine endometrial cancer, characterized by extensive local invasion and lymph node metastases. Differential diagnosis could include other forms of gynecological malignancies, but the histological pattern and tumor marker profile support the primary diagnosis. P: Given the patient's poor general condition and underlying mental health issues, the management plan includes best supportive care. This involves symptom management, psychological support, and regular monitoring of her condition to manage complications. Referral to palliative care services is recommended to provide comprehensive support and manage quality of life. Family education regarding prognosis and care expectations is crucial to ensure adequate support and understanding of the disease process. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today? Patient: I'm feeling okay, thank you. Doctor: I see that you experienced an ST-elevation myocardial infarction 2 years ago and had a successful treatment with 3 drug-eluting stents in your left anterior descending artery. Can you tell me if you've had any recent symptoms or discomfort? Patient: No, I haven't had any symptoms lately. Doctor: That's good to hear. Your echocardiography results show a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. However, there are regional wall motion abnormalities corresponding to the territory of the infarction, which are anterior and anteroseptal. Do you understand what that means? Patient: Oh, not really. Doctor: It means that although your heart is functioning well overall, there are still some areas of the heart muscle that are not moving as they should due to the previous heart attack. Patient: I see, so what can we do about it? Doctor: Your cardiovascular risk profile shows a history of smoking, with 20 pack-years, treated hypercholesteremia, obesity with a body mass index of 30 kg/m2, and psychosocial stress. It is important to address these risk factors to prevent further complications. Patient: Yes, I've been trying to work on those. Doctor: That's great. Your current medication includes aspirin, bisoprolol, lisinopril, and rosuvastatin. Please continue taking these medications as prescribed. Patient: Okay, I will. Doctor: Even though you are currently free of symptoms, in light of secondary preventive aims, I recommend you undergo cardiovascular rehabilitation to further improve your heart health and reduce the risk of future events. Patient: What does cardiovascular rehabilitation involve? Doctor: It typically involves a combination of exercise training, education on heart-healthy living, and counseling to reduce stress and help you return to an active life. Patient: That sounds helpful. How do I get started? Doctor: I will refer you to a specialist who will provide a tailored program for your specific needs and guide you through the process. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any concerns or questions in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello! I see that you have no past medical history. What brings you to our clinic today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having a painless left scrotal mass for about a month now. Doctor: I see. Is there any history of orchitis or scrotal contusion? Patient: No, not at all. Doctor: Alright, let's do a physical examination. I found a 2 cm palpable mass in the upper pole of your left testis. There are no signs of scrotal inflammation. The mass has a firm consistency and regular margins. Palpation of your right testis and the lower pole of your left testis seems normal. Patient: Oh, okay. Doctor: We'll need to run some routine blood tests and order a bioassay of testicular tumor markers. These tests will help us determine if the mass is a testicular tumor. Patient: Sure, Doctor. (After receiving test results) Doctor: Your test results are back, and they show that your alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are within normal ranges. Additionally, there is no bacterial growth in your urine analysis, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis screening. Patient: That's good to hear. Doctor: Yes, indeed. We also performed a scrotal ultrasound, which showed a homogeneous testicular parenchyma with conserved vascularization on Doppler. An extratesticular mass was observed, attached to the upper pole of your testis. The mass appears isoechoic to the testis parenchyma and poorly vascularized on Doppler imaging. Patient: What does that mean, Doctor? Doctor: Based on these findings, we decided to perform a radical inguinal orchiectomy. We first did a high ligation of the spermatic cord. The operative specimen included the testis and the tunica vaginalis in one piece. Patient: How did the surgery go? Doctor: The surgery went well. The macroscopic aspect of the supratesticular mass looked similar to splenic tissue. There were no macroscopic lesions of the testis and the spermatic cord. Your postoperative course was uneventful, and you were discharged on the second postoperative day. Patient: That's good to know. Doctor: The histological examination of the operative specimen confirmed the presence of regular splenic tissue in the suspect mass, without any signs of malignancy. The splenic proliferation had its proper and regular capsule, demarcating it from the testis. Testicular pulp, the albuginea, and the tunica vaginalis had a preserved microscopic architecture. Patient: So, everything is alright now? Doctor: Yes, everything seems to be fine. We examined you 3 weeks after the orchiectomy, and we'll examine you again 2 months after the orchiectomy as a follow-up. Patient: Great, thank you, Doctor! [/INST] S: The patient, a male with no significant past medical history, presented with a chief complaint of a painless left scrotal mass that he noticed about a month ago. He denied any history of orchitis or scrotal contusion. O: Physical examination revealed a 2 cm palpable mass in the upper pole of the left testis, with firm consistency and regular margins, without signs of scrotal inflammation. The right testis and the lower pole of the left testis appeared normal. Routine blood tests and bioassay of testicular tumor markers, including alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), were within normal limits. Urine analysis showed no bacterial growth, including negative screening for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Scrotal ultrasound demonstrated an extratesticular mass attached to the upper pole of the testis, isoechoic to the testis parenchyma and poorly vascularized. A radical inguinal orchiectomy was performed, and histological examination confirmed the presence of regular splenic tissue in the mass, with no signs of malignancy. A: The diagnosis is splenogonadal fusion, a benign condition characterized by the presence of splenic tissue in the scrotum. The differential diagnosis initially included testicular tumor, but this was ruled out based on tumor marker levels and histological findings. P: The patient underwent a successful radical inguinal orchiectomy with high ligation of the spermatic cord. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged on the second postoperative day. Follow-up examinations are scheduled for 3 weeks and 2 months post-orchiectomy to monitor recovery and ensure no complications arise. Further management includes routine follow-up to monitor for any recurrence or complications related to the surgery. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've been admitted here due to right hemiparesis and dysarthria. Can you tell me about your medical history? Patient: Yeah, I had an ischemic stroke about eight years ago. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. We did a full examination and diagnosed your complaints after 30 minutes. We performed a cerebral computed tomography (CT) which revealed chronic infarction in your right hemisphere, and a cranial diffusion magnetic resonance imaging showed an acute ischemic focus in your left hemisphere. Based on these findings, you have a transient ischemic attack. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Don't worry. We've performed a carotid angiography to further investigate your condition. Angiography demonstrated 70% focal stenosis of your left internal carotid artery (LICA). To treat this, we performed an angioplasty of the LICA stenosis. Patient: What was the procedure like? Doctor: First, we administered Acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/d) and clopidogrel (75 mg/d) for seven days before the procedure. Then, during the procedure, we gave you 75 U/kg of unfractionated heparin and measured your Activated Clotting Time value as 275 seconds. We inserted a distal protection device (EPI Embolic Protection Inc., Boston Scientific Corporation) using the transfemoral approach. Patient: And then what happened? Doctor: We implanted a 6 to 8 × 40 mm closed cell self-expandable stent (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA) and post-dilated it using a 5.0 × 20 mm balloon. However, three hours later, you developed motor aphasia and right hemiplegia. Patient: That was scary. What did you do? Doctor: We ordered an emergent cerebral CT scan, which thankfully did not reveal any signs of intracerebral hemorrhage. However, we learned that you had not taken the prescribed Acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel from the start because you hadn't adhered to your medical therapy. Patient: I'm sorry, I didn't realize how important it was. Doctor: It's crucial to follow medical therapy guidelines. We urgently transferred you to the catheter laboratory, where digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and selective carotid angiography revealed acute carotid stent thrombosis. Patient: What did you do to treat it? Doctor: We administered 300 mg of clopidogrel and 75 U/kg of unfractionated heparin intravenously, and then selectively set it into the carotid using the transfemoral approach. We also gave you 7 mg of t-PA, which was slowly pushed into the internal carotid artery using the intraarterial selective method. Patient: Thank you for taking care of me, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. It's important to follow your medical therapy guidelines moving forward to ensure a better outcome. Please reach out if you have any further concerns or questions. [/INST] S: The patient, previously diagnosed with ischemic stroke eight years ago, presented with right hemiparesis and dysarthria. He reported non-adherence to prescribed medical therapy, including Acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel. O: Examination and imaging confirmed a transient ischemic attack with chronic infarction in the right hemisphere and an acute ischemic focus in the left hemisphere. Carotid angiography showed 70% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. Post-angioplasty, the patient developed motor aphasia and right hemiplegia. Emergent CT scan ruled out intracerebral hemorrhage but revealed acute carotid stent thrombosis. Treatment included administration of clopidogrel, unfractionated heparin, and intraarterial t-PA. A: The primary diagnosis is transient ischemic attack with complications of acute carotid stent thrombosis post-angioplasty. Differential diagnosis includes recurrent ischemic stroke. The prognosis is cautious, contingent on adherence to therapy and monitoring for further complications. P: The management plan includes strict adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy with Acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/d) and clopidogrel (75 mg/d). Regular follow-up appointments for monitoring therapy effectiveness and potential complications are scheduled. Patient education on the importance of medication compliance has been reinforced. Referral to a stroke rehabilitation program and a consultation with a neurologist are planned to optimize recovery and prevent recurrence. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Patient: Hi doctor, I've been experiencing some transient muscle stiffness for the past 10 years, and it's been causing me difficulty in initiating movement and muscle weakness after rest. Doctor: I see. Does the stiffness improve after some repeated contraction, like a ""warm-up"" phenomenon? Patient: Yes, that's right. But the symptoms tend to aggravate during cold weather. For example, I'm unable to open my eyes immediately after washing my face with cold water. Doctor: Hmm, interesting. Do you have any significant family history of similar issues? Patient: No, not that I know of. My parents are not related, and I've had normal growth and development. Doctor: Alright, let me share with you the findings of your medical examination. You showed generalized muscle hypertrophy and normal muscle strength, as assessed with the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score. Your deep tendon reflexes were attenuated, but there were no signs of nerve dysfunction or sensory deficit. Patient: Okay, what about the tests you performed? Doctor: Your serum creatine kinase level was found to be 2-fold higher than the upper limit of the normal reference level. The electromyogram showed myotonic discharges. We also conducted a biceps muscle biopsy, which was precooled with isopentane and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Patient: What did you find in the biopsy? Doctor: A section of the muscle biopsy specimen was stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and modified Gomori’s trichrome (MGT). The activity of oxidative enzymes such as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), NADH-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR), and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) were found to be normal. Patient: So, what does that mean? Doctor: We performed next generation sequencing of your DNA sample and identified a novel splice mutation (c.1401 + 1G > A) inherited from your father, and a known mutation (c.1657A > T, p.Ile553Phe) inherited from your mother. The novel splice mutation was not detected in the Human Gene Mutation Database or any of the 200 healthy controls we tested. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: The splicing site, analyzed by Human Splicing Finder, is implicated in the alteration of the wild-type donor site and most probably has an impact on splicing. The Mutation Taster software predicted the effects of the mutation to be 'disease causing'. This means that the combination of these mutations is likely causing your symptoms. Patient: Oh, I see. What should I do now? Doctor: We will need to refer you to a specialist who can provide you with more information on how to manage your condition and any necessary follow-up care. In the meantime, try to avoid situations that may trigger your symptoms, such as exposure to cold temperatures. Patient: Alright, thank you for your help, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We're here to support you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today? Patient: I'm okay, but I've been feeling weak lately. Doctor: I see. Let's discuss your recent test results. You're an 81-year-old female and all your health-related measures are within their reference values. However, I noticed that you have low HAND and PWR, which indicates poor strength. Have you been experiencing any difficulty in maintaining your balance? Patient: Yes, I have been having trouble keeping my balance. Doctor: Your test results show high ""ML Postural Reaction Time and Jerkiness"" (QS3) and ""AP Postural Control Impairment"" (QS4). This means you have difficulty maintaining a static balance. These findings are confirming what has been reported elsewhere. Have you noticed any issues with your walking as well? Patient: Hmm, yeah, I think my walking has been a bit jerky. Doctor: That's consistent with your results. You have a high ""Gait Jerkiness"" (7MW3) score. We also assessed your ability to perform the Chair Stand Test (CST), and you showed poor performance in that area as well. Your ""Dynamic Postural Impairment"" (CST1), ""Stand-to-Sit Jerkiness"" (CST4), and ""AP Stand-to-Sit Weakness"" (CST5) were all high. This indicates that you have difficulty transitioning from standing to sitting and vice versa.  Patient: Oh, I see. That makes sense. Doctor: I'd recommend that you work on improving your strength and balance through targeted exercises and potentially seeking the help of a physical therapist. This will help you reduce the risk of falls and improve your overall mobility. Patient: Okay, I'll look into that. Thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome.

Differential diagnoses could include neurological disorders or other musculoskeletal issues contributing to these symptoms. The prognosis depends on intervention effectiveness and patient compliance with recommended therapies. P: Management plan includes initiating targeted exercises to improve strength and balance. Referral to a physical therapist is recommended to tailor a specific exercise regimen and provide guidance. Regular follow-ups to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. Patient education on the importance of adhering to the exercise program to reduce fall risk and improve mobility. Encourage the patient to report any new symptoms or concerns promptly. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Good morning, I've read your medical history, but can you please tell me more about the swelling on the left side of your face? Patient: Good morning, doctor. Sure, I noticed swelling on the left side of my face a while ago, and it's been bothering me. Doctor: I see. Based on your CT images, it appears that you have a radiodense network of an expanded dysplastic bone lesion involving your maxilla, zygoma, ethmoid bones, orbit, cranial base, and hemimandible. You have been diagnosed with polyostotic craniofacial FD. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What does it mean, doctor? Doctor: It's a type of bone disorder that can cause deformities and pain. However, in your case, I don't see any visual disorders or other major complications. Your preoperative cephalometric analysis showed a canting of 5 mm downwards though. Patient: So, what do we do about it, doctor? Doctor: We have a surgical procedure planned for you, which includes Le Fort I osteotomy, sagittal split ramus osteotomy, and genioplasty. These procedures will be performed under general anesthesia. Patient: Hmm, okay. What will these procedures involve? Doctor: During the Le Fort I osteotomy, we will remove the dysplastic bone lesion extensively to ensure maxillary impaction and correct the occlusal canting. After the removal, we will debulk the maxilla and zygomaticomaxillary region. Rigid internal fixation will be performed using miniplates, which are 2 mm thick. Patient: And what about the other procedures? Doctor: The sagittal split ramus osteotomy (BSSRO) will be performed to improve your mandibular occlusal canting and remove more of the dysplastic bone. Additionally, body shaving and genioplasty will be performed to improve the esthetics of your face. Patient: I see. How was the recovery after the surgery? Doctor: Your postoperative recovery was uneventful. After 18 months, your occlusion was stable and there was no evidence of recurrence or relapse. Two years after the initial surgery, during the plate removal, we examined the site of the maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy and observed a significant osseous union between the osteotomized segments. Patient: That's great to hear. Is there anything else I should know? Doctor: Yes, there was a slight expansion of the external cortex of the left maxilla, but it didn't influence your facial symmetry. Four years after the initial surgery, you did not show any further expansion or re-growth of the dysplastic lesion. Patient: That's a relief! Thank you, doctor, for all the information and the treatment. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any concerns or notice any changes, don't hesitate to contact us. Take care! [/INST] S: The patient reported noticing swelling on the left side of his face, which has been bothering him. He has no visual disorders or other major complications but mentioned a preoperative cephalometric analysis showing a canting of 5 mm downwards. O: CT images revealed a radiodense network of an expanded dysplastic bone lesion involving the maxilla, zygoma, ethmoid bones, orbit, cranial base, and hemimandible. Surgical procedures performed included Le Fort I osteotomy, sagittal split ramus osteotomy, and genioplasty under general anesthesia. Postoperative recovery was uneventful with stable occlusion and no evidence of recurrence or relapse after 18 months. Two years post-surgery, significant osseous union was observed at the osteotomy site. Four years post-surgery, there was a slight expansion of the external cortex of the left maxilla without affecting facial symmetry. A: The primary diagnosis is polyostotic craniofacial fibrous dysplasia (FD). The patient's condition has been managed surgically with no major complications or recurrence of the disease. The slight expansion of the external cortex of the left maxilla noted four years post-surgery does not currently impact facial symmetry or function. P: Continue regular follow-up to monitor for any changes or progression of the disease. Encourage the patient to report any new symptoms or concerns immediately. No additional surgical interventions are planned at this time, focusing on monitoring and supportive care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented to the Department of Pediatric Dentistry of the Faculty of Dental Medicine at Saint-Joseph University of Beirut. What seems to be the problem? Patient: Hi, doctor. My main problem is that all my primary teeth have become loose and then they just fell out by themselves. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me about any other medical issues you've been experiencing? Patient: Yes, I've been having this hyperkeratosis on my palms and soles. I'm actually undergoing dermatological treatment for it. Doctor: Alright. Were you referred here by your dermatologist? Patient: Yes, my dermatologist sent me here because they suspected it might be related to something called PLS. Doctor: I see. Let's talk about your family history. Are your parents, grandparents, or other relatives consanguineously married? And has anybody in your family experienced similar symptoms? Patient: Yes, my parents and grandparents are consanguineously married. Two of my cousins have the same problems, like palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and premature loss of deciduous and permanent teeth. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Now let's move on to the examination. I notice that you are missing several primary teeth (teeth 54, 52, 51, 61, 62, 64, 74, 72, 71, 81, and 82). Your remaining teeth (teeth 85, 84, 83, 73, 75, 65, 63, 53, and 55) have plaque accumulation, multiple caries, and generalized grade III mobility with the formation of periodontal pockets. The gingival tissues surrounding these teeth are inflamed, edematous, and tender to palpation. How do the gums in the edentulous regions feel? Patient: The gums where I don't have teeth feel normal and not tender when I touch them. Doctor: I also noticed dental and periodontal abscesses on teeth 85 and 75. We took a panoramic radiograph, which showed floating teeth and generalized horizontal and vertical bone loss. We'll need to address that. Patient: Okay, doctor. What about my blood tests? Doctor: Your routine hematological examination, including CBC and blood chemistry profile, as well as liver function tests, are all normal. Patient: That's good to hear. What about the genetic test? Doctor: We performed a genetic test at the Saint Joseph University Faculty of Medicine/Laboratory of Molecular Biology. The test involved a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by fluorescent Sanger sequencing of exons 3 to 7 of the CTSC gene. We are currently waiting for the results to confirm the diagnosis and plan treatment accordingly. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help in figuring this out. Doctor: You're welcome. We will contact you as soon as we have the results, and we will discuss the next steps in your treatment. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out. [/INST] S: The patient, a child, reports spontaneous loss of all primary teeth and is currently undergoing treatment for hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles. The patient was referred by a dermatologist suspecting Papillon-Lefevre Syndrome (PLS). Family history reveals consanguineous marriages and similar symptoms in cousins. O: Clinical examination shows absence of several primary teeth with the remaining exhibiting plaque, multiple caries, and grade III mobility with periodontal pockets. Gingival tissues are inflamed and edematous. Panoramic radiograph reveals floating teeth and generalized bone loss. Routine hematological and liver function tests are normal. Awaiting results from genetic testing targeting the CTSC gene. A: The primary consideration is Papillon-Lefevre Syndrome, indicated by oral and dermatological symptoms, family history, and clinical findings. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of periodontitis, but genetic testing will be crucial for confirmation. P: Plan to manage dental issues includes addressing dental and periodontal abscesses, maintaining oral hygiene, and possibly extracting severely affected teeth. Dermatological treatment for hyperkeratosis should continue. Await genetic test results to confirm diagnosis and tailor further treatment. Educate patient and family about the condition and ensure regular follow-up. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: My 1-year-old son recently developed a fever, and I noticed some skin eruptions on his body. He seems to be unwell. Doctor: I see. Let's examine him further to determine the cause of his symptoms. We'll run some tests to check for any abnormalities. (After running tests) Doctor: The test results show that your son has hepatoplenomegaly, which is an enlargement of the liver and spleen, as well as pancytopenia, a decrease in all types of blood cells. We also found hyperferritinemia, with a level of 5,181 ng/ml, and an elevated soluble IL-2 receptor at 6,797 U/ml. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What could be causing all this? Doctor: We checked for anti-EBV antibodies, which indicated a primary infection of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). High EBV loads were detected in your son's peripheral blood and CD8+ T cells, with 1 × 10^5 copies/ml and 1 × 10^6 copies/μgDNA, respectively. These findings led us to diagnose him with EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH). Patient: What about his NK-cell activity? Doctor: His NK-cell activity is at 30% lysis, which falls within the normal reference range of 18-40%. Patient: What's the treatment plan for my son? Doctor: We treated your son with two courses of etoposide injections at a dose of 100 mg/m2 to control the relapsing HLH. We also administered immunomodulation therapy using high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin, oral cyclosporine, and prednisolone. Patient: Did the treatment work? Doctor: Yes, after the immunochemotherapy, the circulating levels of the EBV genome became undetectable, which is a positive sign. We also performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of your son's peripheral blood-derived DNA and determined a hemizygous variant of the XIAP gene (c.1045_1047delGAG, p.Glu349del). Patient: So, how is my son doing now? Doctor: Your son is alive and well at 7 years of age, without any sequelae or dysgammaglobulinemia. We also checked the numbers of CD19+IgD−CD27+ switched memory B cells and CD4+CD45RA−CXCR5+ follicular helper T cells, and they were not decreased, as shown in the data. Patient: That's great news! Thank you so much, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any concerns or notice any changes in his health, don't hesitate to contact us. We'll continue to monitor his progress closely. [/INST] S: The patient's mother reports that her 1-year-old son developed a fever and skin eruptions. She expresses concern about his general well-being. O: Physical examination and laboratory tests reveal hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia. Hyperferritinemia is noted with a ferritin level of 5,181 ng/ml (normal range: 30-400 ng/ml). Soluble IL-2 receptor level is elevated at 6,797 U/ml. Anti-EBV antibodies and high EBV loads are detected in the peripheral blood and CD8+ T cells, with 1 × 10^5 copies/ml and 1 × 10^6 copies/μgDNA, respectively. NK-cell activity is within normal limits at 30% lysis (normal range: 18-40%). Genetic analysis reveals a hemizygous variant of the XIAP gene. A: The primary diagnosis is EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH), confirmed by high EBV loads and clinical symptoms of fever and hepatosplenomegaly. The presence of the XIAP gene variant suggests a genetic predisposition to HLH. P: The patient was treated with two courses of etoposide at 100 mg/m2, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin, oral cyclosporine, and prednisolone. Post-treatment, EBV genome levels became undetectable, indicating a positive response to the treatment. Ongoing monitoring of immune cell subsets and EBV status is planned to prevent relapse. The patient's mother is advised to monitor his health and report any new symptoms. Regular follow-ups are scheduled to assess his condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you're here for an evaluation of progressive yellow discoloration of your eyes and skin over the last 2 months. Can you tell me more about how this started? Patient: Yes, I was in my usual state of health until August when I strained my right shoulder. To relieve the pain, I started taking an over-the-counter herbal supplement called kratom, along with acetaminophen. Doctor: I see. How much acetaminophen were you taking and for how long? Patient: I was taking 800 mg of acetaminophen twice daily for almost 2 months, but it didn't help much with the pain. Doctor: And how did you take the kratom? Patient: I started taking it twice a day for a few days, and then once a day. I took it in the form of crushed leaves with water, about 1 teaspoonful daily. Doctor: Okay, so you were on kratom from early August until October 6, 2018. How have you been feeling since then? Patient: At the presentation on October 22, 2018, I felt mild fatigue, but my friends didn't notice any changes in my mental status, like anything suspicious for hepatic encephalopathy. Doctor: Based on your workup, we found that you have an elevated bilirubin level of 23.2 mg/dL, which could be causing your jaundice. Total bilirubin peaked about 10 days later at 28.9 mg/dL. Your International normalizes ratio levels are within the normal range, though. Patient: What about other tests? Doctor: Your aspartate aminotransferase was 55 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 66 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 255 U/L, and lipase 156 U/L. We also performed a magnetic resonance imaging of your abdomen, which did not reveal any signs of intrinsic liver disease or issues with your biliary ducts. Patient: So, what could be causing my symptoms? Doctor: We conducted a liver biopsy to further investigate. The results showed marked canalicular cholestasis, mixed inflammation of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and some neutrophils in your portal tracts. Some bile ducts showed features of injury, such as epithelial disarray, cytoplasmic eosinophilia, and lymphocytes within the epithelium. However, there was no appreciable interface activity or portal edema. Patient: What does all that mean? Doctor: It's possible that the kratom and acetaminophen you were taking may have caused some liver injury and inflammation, leading to the elevated bilirubin levels and jaundice. The good news is that there's no evidence of chronic liver disease. Patient: So, what should I do now? Doctor: It would be best to stop taking kratom and acetaminophen for now. We'll monitor your liver function and bilirubin levels closely to see if they improve. If your symptoms persist or worsen, we may need to explore other treatment options. Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. I'll stop taking those medications and keep an eye on my symptoms. Doctor: Great. Please follow up with me in a few weeks so we can re-evaluate your condition and ensure you're on the right path to recovery. If you have any concerns in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out. [/INST] S: The patient presents with progressive yellow discoloration of the eyes and skin over the last 2 months, initially in good health until August when he strained his right shoulder. He started taking kratom and 800 mg of acetaminophen twice daily for nearly 2 months to alleviate pain. He reports mild fatigue but no changes in mental status suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy. O: Physical examination revealed jaundice. Laboratory tests showed elevated bilirubin levels, peaking at 28.9 mg/dL (normal range: 0.1-1.2 mg/dL), with normal International Normalized Ratio levels. Liver function tests were slightly elevated with aspartate aminotransferase at 55 U/L (normal range: 10-40 U/L), alanine aminotransferase at 66 U/L (normal range: 7-56 U/L), alkaline phosphatase at 255 U/L (normal range: 40-130 U/L), and lipase at 156 U/L (normal range: 13-60 U/L). MRI of the abdomen showed no intrinsic liver disease or biliary duct issues. Liver biopsy indicated marked canalicular cholestasis and mixed inflammation, with some bile duct injury but no chronic liver disease. A: The primary diagnosis is drug-induced liver injury (DILI) likely secondary to the use of kratom and high-dose acetaminophen. The liver biopsy supports this diagnosis showing features consistent with medication-induced liver damage. There is no evidence of chronic liver disease or other intrinsic liver pathology. P: The patient is advised to immediately discontinue the use of kratom and acetaminophen. Close monitoring of liver function and bilirubin levels will be conducted to assess improvement. Follow-up in a few weeks is scheduled to re-evaluate liver status and overall health. If symptoms persist or worsen, further diagnostic evaluation and alternative treatment options will be considered. The patient is instructed to avoid hepatotoxic substances and to contact healthcare providers if symptoms develop or worsen. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me what brought you here today? Patient: Well, I recently developed diplopia and some balance disorders. Doctor: I see. When did these symptoms start? Patient: They started about 24 hours ago. It's been getting worse, and now I'm having ascending paresthesias and an emerging tetraparesis. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. We admitted you to the hospital and performed an examination. You appeared drowsy, and we observed ophthalmoparesis, areflexia, and severe tetraparesis. Your plantar responses were flexor. We also conducted a cerebrospinal fluid study, which came back normal.  Patient: Hmm, okay. So what does that mean? Doctor: We detected IgM to Mycoplasma Pneumoniae and IgG anti-GQ1b (1:2560) in your blood. However, IgG and IgM anti-GM1, -GD1a, -GD1b, and -GM2 were absent. Additionally, we performed two MRIs of your brain, one with gadolinium, and both were normal. Patient: So, what was the treatment for my condition? Doctor: We treated you with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) at a dosage of 0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days. Unfortunately, you worsened to complete ophthalmoplegia, tetraplegia, and coma, requiring mechanical ventilation. Patient: Oh no, that's terrible. Did I improve after that? Doctor: Yes, considering the severity of your condition, we started a second IVIg course on day 24. A few days later, you began to improve, with initial resolution of the drowsiness and bulbar symptoms, and partial resolution of the ophthalmoplegia. Patient: That's good to hear. What happened next? Doctor: On day 41, you were weaned off ventilation, and on day 57, you were transferred to rehabilitation with improved muscle strength. Your MCR scale was 2-3/5 in the lower limbs and 2/5 in the upper limbs. Patient: Were there any more tests done? Doctor: Yes, after considering the results of the nerve conduction studies performed on days 72 and 128, we searched for antibodies to Neurofascin155, Contactin1, and Contactin associated protein1, but they were negative. However, your anti-GQ1b IgG rate remained elevated at 1:2560 five months after the onset of symptoms. Patient: So, what was the next step in my treatment? Doctor: We started a third IVIg course on day 179. By day 240, you had recovered muscle strength, except in the right upper limb, where your MCR scale was 3-4/5, and you showed mild gait ataxia. Patient: I see. And what about the serial conduction studies? Doctor: We performed four serial conduction studies which you can find in the table and Fig. They helped us monitor your progress and adjust the treatment as needed. Patient: Thank you for explaining everything, doctor. I appreciate it. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help you throughout your recovery. [/INST] S: The patient presented with symptoms of diplopia, balance disorders, ascending paresthesias, and emerging tetraparesis starting approximately 24 hours prior to admission. The patient reported worsening of symptoms leading to severe tetraparesis and required hospital admission. O: Upon examination, the patient was drowsy with ophthalmoparesis, areflexia, severe tetraparesis, and flexor plantar responses. Cerebrospinal fluid studies were normal. Blood tests revealed IgM to Mycoplasma Pneumoniae and high titers of IgG anti-GQ1b (1:2560), while other ganglioside antibodies were absent. Brain MRIs with and without gadolinium were normal. The patient was treated with IVIg at 0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days, but symptoms progressed to complete ophthalmoplegia, tetraplegia, and coma, necessitating mechanical ventilation. Improvement was noted after a second course of IVIg, with partial resolution of ophthalmoplegia and improvement in muscle strength. Nerve conduction studies were performed, and additional antibodies were tested but were negative. The patient's anti-GQ1b IgG remained elevated at 1:2560 five months post-symptom onset. A: The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are consistent with a severe case of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), specifically the Miller Fisher variant, given the presence of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia, and high titers of anti-GQ1b antibodies. The progression despite initial treatment and the requirement for prolonged mechanical ventilation indicate a severe course. P: The patient received multiple courses of IVIg, which led to gradual improvement. Continued monitoring of muscle strength and nerve conduction studies was necessary. The patient was transferred to rehabilitation on day 57 to further aid recovery. A third course of IVIg was initiated on day 179 due to incomplete recovery, particularly in the right upper limb. Serial conduction studies were performed to monitor progress and guide ongoing treatment adjustments. Further rehabilitation and supportive care will be essential for recovery, with close monitoring of respiratory and motor functions. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I heard you were referred to our emergency department. What brings you in today? Patient: My son has been having recurrent attacks of colicky abdominal pain and non-bilious vomiting. It happened 5 times in the last 24 hours. Doctor: I see. Has he had any other health issues recently? Patient: Yes, he has allergic rhinitis and has had recurrent attacks of gastroenteritis in the last four months. Doctor: Okay, let's have a look at him. (Upon presentation) He seems to be conscious, alert, and comfortable in bed. His vital signs are stable as well. Now, I'll perform an abdominal examination. (By inspection) His abdomen has a normal contour without distention or bulging mass, and normal respiratory movement. (By palpation) The abdomen is soft and lax, with no tenderness, rigidity, or palpable mass. When was the last time he defecated? Patient: About 12 hours ago. Doctor: Alright. (Performs PR examination) I don't feel any palpable mass, and his rectum is empty without any red currant jelly stool. We'll need to perform an abdominal ultrasonography to further investigate the issue. (After ultrasonography) Doctor: The ultrasonography revealed a long segment small-intestinal intussusception extending from the subhepatic region through the right lumber region until the right iliac fossa region. It has a pseudokidney appearance. There's no abdominal collection. We also took a plain erect abdominal X-ray, which showed neither air-fluid levels nor gas under the diaphragm. There was only fundic gas and a small amount of right colonic gas. We would usually perform an abdominal computed tomography (CT), but unfortunately, our hospital's resources are limited, and we won't be able to do that. Patient: Oh, I see. What's the next step then? Doctor: We've decided to perform conservative treatment with multiple ultrasonographic examinations. We'll continue this approach for 6 hours, during which he should have nothing per mouth (NPO). He'll receive medical treatment in the form of IV fluid, 3rd generation cephalosporin, ampicillin/sulbactam, metronidazole, and antioedematous drugs such as dexamethasone and lasix. Patient: Okay, thank you. (After 6 hours) Doctor: How has your son been during this period? Patient: He had one more attack of colicky abdominal pain and non-bilious gastric vomiting. But he also passed well-formed normal brownish coloured stool. Doctor: I see. (Performs abdominal examination again) The abdominal examination results are the same as before. (Performs PR examination) His stool is well-formed, normal brown coloured, and without any redcurrant jelly secretion. Due to the recurrent symptoms, we'll continue to monitor him closely and adjust his treatment as necessary. Patient: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, a young boy, presented with recurrent attacks of colicky abdominal pain and non-bilious vomiting, occurring five times in the last 24 hours. He has a history of allergic rhinitis and recurrent gastroenteritis over the past four months. His last bowel movement was 12 hours prior to the visit. O: On examination, the patient was conscious, alert, and comfortable. Vital signs were stable. Abdominal examination showed a soft, lax abdomen with no tenderness, rigidity, or palpable mass. Rectal examination revealed an empty rectum without any red currant jelly stool. Abdominal ultrasonography identified a long segment of small-intestinal intussusception from the subhepatic region to the right iliac fossa with a pseudokidney appearance. A plain erect abdominal X-ray showed fundic gas and a small amount of right colonic gas, with no air-fluid levels or gas under the diaphragm. A: The primary diagnosis is small-intestinal intussusception. The differential diagnosis could include other causes of acute abdominal pain and vomiting in children, such as gastroenteritis, but the imaging findings support intussusception. The prognosis depends on the response to conservative treatment and the possibility of requiring surgical intervention if symptoms persist or worsen. P: The initial management plan includes conservative treatment with multiple ultrasonographic examinations over a 6-hour period, during which the patient will be NPO. Medical treatment consists of IV fluids, 3rd generation cephalosporin, ampicillin/sulbactam, metronidazole, and antioedematous drugs (dexamethasone, lasix). The patient will be closely monitored, and treatment will be adjusted based on symptomatology and further diagnostic findings. If symptoms persist or worsen, surgical consultation may be necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Patient: Hi doctor, I came to the emergency department because I've been experiencing some severe left upper abdominal pain for the past day. Doctor: I see. Can you describe the nature of the pain, and if there are any other symptoms associated with it? Patient: Yes, the pain is moderate to severe, crampy, constant, and it's in the left upper part of my abdomen. It's also radiating to my lower chest and back. I've had diaphoresis, nausea, and I've vomited non-bloody, non-bilious liquid several times. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We will conduct some tests to better understand your condition.  (After running some tests) Doctor: Your test results are back. Your complete blood counts, comprehensive metabolic panels, and hepatic function tests are within reference ranges. However, your coagulation profile is at a subtherapeutic level. Can you tell me about your past medical history? Patient: I have nonischemic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular thrombus, and I've had four cerebrovascular accidents that left me with residual right leg numbness. I was managing my condition with warfarin. Doctor: Thank you for the information. During the physical examination, we noticed fine crackles within your left lower lobe and significant tenderness in the left upper abdomen. You mentioned taking warfarin; did you stop taking it recently? Patient: Yes, I stopped taking warfarin two days prior to my admission here. Doctor: We did a Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and it showed septal and apical predominantly transmural infarct. Additionally, a transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a mildly dilated left ventricle with moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction, an ejection fraction of 30% to 35% with distal anterior, anteroseptal, and apical akinesis with mild mitral regurgitation. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: The Cardiac catheterization findings were unremarkable, but a computed tomography (CT) scan of your abdomen showed mild cardiomegaly with a previous infarction on the anterior-inferior wall of the left ventricle. We also found a 37.47 mm calcified thrombus in the left ventricular apex with peripheral calcifications. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: Additionally, there is infarction in your spleen and right kidney, with bilateral renal scarring. We have started you on a heparin drip to help manage your condition, and we will bridge you to warfarin on the third day. Patient: Okay, so what's the plan for my recovery? Doctor: We will monitor your progress closely, and we expect a complete resolution of your abdominal pain. After seven days, we plan to discharge you with proper medication compliance reinforced before you leave. Patient: I understand, thank you for your help, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, a known case of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular thrombus, presented with severe, crampy, constant left upper abdominal pain radiating to the lower chest and back, accompanied by diaphoresis, nausea, and non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting. The patient stopped taking warfarin two days before admission. O: Physical examination revealed fine crackles in the left lower lobe and significant tenderness in the left upper abdomen. Laboratory tests including complete blood counts, comprehensive metabolic panels, and hepatic function tests were within normal limits, but the coagulation profile was subtherapeutic. Cardiac MRI indicated septal and apical predominantly transmural infarct. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a mildly dilated left ventricle with moderate to severe dysfunction, an ejection fraction of 30-35%, and mild mitral regurgitation. CT scan of the abdomen revealed mild cardiomegaly, a previous infarction on the anterior-inferior wall of the left ventricle, a 37.47 mm calcified thrombus in the left ventricular apex with peripheral calcifications, infarction in the spleen and right kidney, and bilateral renal scarring. A: The primary diagnosis is acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure due to noncompliance with warfarin therapy, leading to thromboembolic complications including splenic and renal infarction. Differential diagnoses could include acute pancreatitis or peptic ulcer disease, but these are less likely given the imaging results and clinical presentation. P: The patient was started on a heparin drip to manage coagulation and will be bridged back to warfarin on the third day. Monitoring will continue in the hospital with plans to discharge after seven days, ensuring medication compliance is reinforced. Education regarding the importance of anticoagulation therapy will be provided, along with follow-up appointments scheduled with cardiology and primary care to manage and monitor heart function and anticoagulation therapy. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Welcome, I see you've been admitted to our hospital due to recurrent leg ulcerations. Can you tell me about when you first noticed these issues? Patient: Yeah, about eight years ago I noticed some purpura on both of my legs, and it eventually progressed to painful ulcerations. Doctor: I see. You were diagnosed with livedoid vasculitis complicated by cellulitis at that time, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. And I also had some joint pain, so I was referred to a rheumatologist. Doctor: Your laboratory findings revealed positive for antinuclear antibody (×320), anti-double-strand DNA antibody (342 IU/mL), and anti-cardiolipin antibody (ACA) (18 U/mL), which led to a diagnosis of SLE. You were then treated with 15 mg of prednisolone along with topical therapies such as wound cleaning and topical ointments application. Were any immunosuppressive agents used at that time? Patient: No, they didn't use any immunosuppressive agents back then. Doctor: It seems that your leg ulcerations improved and healed with scars in approximately 3 years. You remained asymptomatic under a maintenance dose of 10 mg of prednisolone. However, your leg ulcerations relapsed 2 years ago, and you were referred to our hospital. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Our physical examination revealed swelling of your right leg with multiple small ulcers, white scars, and purpura. We suspected a deterioration of livedoid vasculitis complicated by SLE and introduced methylprednisolone pulse therapy (MPT: 1 g/d intravenously for 3 days) together with antiplatelet medications followed by 50 mg of prednisolone and 50 mg of azathioprine. Did you experience any pain relief after this treatment? Patient: Yes, I felt immediate pain relief and the leg ulcerations gradually improved and healed with scars in 2 months. Doctor: Since the healing of the ulcers, we tapered your prednisolone and you remained asymptomatic. However, 3 months ago, you had a relapse of ulcerations on your right leg. Can you describe the appearance of the ulcers? Patient: They had a moth-eaten appearance and there were multiple ulcerations. Doctor: I understand. This time, the MPT had little effect. We performed a skin rebiopsy, which revealed occlusion of superficial dermal small vessels due to fibrin thrombus. Infiltration of inflammatory cells around the dermal vessels was scarce. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of livedoid vasculitis. We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan accordingly. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of livedoid vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), reports recurrent leg ulcerations beginning eight years ago, initially presenting as purpura and progressing to painful ulcerations. The patient experienced joint pain and was referred to a rheumatologist. The patient's symptoms improved with prednisolone and topical treatments but relapsed two years ago. The patient describes the current ulcers on the right leg as having a moth-eaten appearance. O: Physical examination shows swelling of the right leg with multiple small ulcers, white scars, and purpura. Laboratory findings were positive for antinuclear antibody (×320), anti-double-strand DNA antibody (342 IU/mL), and anti-cardiolipin antibody (18 U/mL). Recent skin rebiopsy confirmed livedoid vasculitis, showing occlusion of superficial dermal small vessels due to fibrin thrombus with minimal inflammatory cell infiltration. A: The primary diagnosis is livedoid vasculitis, complicated by systemic lupus erythematosus. The patient's condition initially responded to prednisolone and topical therapies but has shown resistance to recent methylprednisolone pulse therapy. The prognosis is cautious given the recurrent nature of the ulcerations and the potential for further complications related to SLE. P: Continue monitoring the patient's condition closely. Maintain current treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine, adjusting dosages as necessary based on symptom progression and side effects. Consider adding or adjusting immunosuppressive agents if no improvement is observed. Ensure regular follow-up appointments for physical examination and laboratory testing to monitor disease activity and medication effects. Educate the patient on signs of potential complications and encourage adherence to the treatment regimen to prevent further relapses. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello! How have you been feeling lately? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I was asymptomatic at my last check-up, so I think I've been doing okay. Doctor: I see. It's been 20 months since your kidney transplantation, so let's do a routine physical examination today. We'll also review your recent test results. Your creatinine level has risen from 1.8 to 2.6 mg/dl since April 2014, and the urinary protein-creatinine-ratio has increased from 200 to 440 mg/g. Have you noticed any changes in your urine? Patient: No, not really. But now that you mention it, I did notice some redness in my urine a week ago. Doctor: Your test results also show microhaematuria, which means there were 20 red cells per high-power field in your urine sample. This can be the cause of the redness you observed. It's important to keep an eye on this. Now, let's go over your medical history. You have coronary artery disease, hypertension, asymptomatic sinusitis, and obesity, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: And you don't have any known history of connective tissue or autoimmune disease, right? Patient: No, not that I'm aware of. Doctor: Your kidney failure was secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and you had reached end-stage renal failure at the age of 58. You underwent 7 years of haemodialysis before receiving a deceased-donor kidney transplant without induction immunosuppression in May 2013, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: And your human leucocyte antigen genotyping and other baseline characteristics were done during that time, as shown in Table. After transplantation, you had an episode of asymptomatic cytomegalovirus reactivation with 1160 CMV copies/ml, which responded to valganciclovir and a reduction of mycophenolate dose. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, it is. Doctor: At the index presentation, your medications had been unchanged for more than 3 months. These were prednisolone 5 mg OD, cyclosporine A 50 mg BD, pantoprazole 20 mg OD, metoprolol 47.5 mg BD, doxazosin 4 mg BD, aspirin 100 mg OD, simvastatin 20 mg OD, allopurinol 150 mg OD, and calcitriol 0.25 μg OD. Are you still taking these medications as prescribed? Patient: Yes, I've been following my medication regimen. Doctor: Due to the unexplained rise in creatinine, we performed a biopsy of your kidney transplant. The biopsy showed eleven glomeruli, three of which were sclerotic. Unexpectedly, three other glomeruli demonstrated extracapillary proliferative changes, with crescent formation and necrosis in two, as seen in Fig. Patient: What does that mean, Doctor? Doctor: The biopsy also revealed interstitial inflammation with eosinophilic cells and borderline changes, which are suspicious for acute cellular rejection. However, the lack of deposition of complement or immunoglobulins indicated a histological diagnosis of pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. Patient: So, what's the next step for me? Doctor: We'll need to closely monitor your kidney function and adjust your medications accordingly. I'll also recommend that you come in for more frequent follow-up visits to keep a close eye on your condition. We want to ensure your kidney transplant continues to function well. Patient: I understand. Thank you, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care. [/INST] S: The patient, a 58-year-old male with a history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease leading to end-stage renal failure, underwent kidney transplantation 20 months ago. He reports being asymptomatic until noticing redness in his urine a week ago. His medical history includes coronary artery disease, hypertension, asymptomatic sinusitis, and obesity. He denies any history of connective tissue or autoimmune diseases. He has been compliant with his medication regimen, including prednisolone, cyclosporine A, and others. O: Recent lab results show an increase in creatinine from 1.8 to 2.6 mg/dl and a urinary protein-creatinine ratio from 200 to 440 mg/g. Microhematuria was noted with 20 red cells per high-power field. A kidney biopsy indicated three sclerotic glomeruli and three with extracapillary proliferative changes, including crescent formation and necrosis. Interstitial inflammation with eosinophilic cells and borderline changes suggestive of acute cellular rejection were observed, but no immunoglobulin or complement deposition, indicating pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. A: The primary diagnosis is pauci-immune glomerulonephritis post-kidney transplantation, with differential diagnoses including acute cellular rejection and chronic transplant glomerulopathy. The patient's symptoms and biopsy findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, which is a concern given his transplant status and underlying conditions. P: The management plan includes close monitoring of kidney function and frequent follow-up visits to assess the progression of the disease and response to treatment adjustments. The patient's medication regimen will be reviewed and adjusted as necessary to address the current kidney function changes and biopsy findings. Education on signs of worsening kidney function and when to seek immediate care will be provided. Referral to a nephrologist for specialized care in managing his kidney transplant and current diagnosis is recommended. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi Susan, I understand you are a 10.9 year old girl who lives at home with your professional parents and a younger sister. How are you feeling today? Susan: I'm feeling anxious, doctor. Doctor: I see. It seems that you have a past medical history of frequent stomach pains and no known medical cause. Have you had any other health problems? Susan: No, just those stomach pains and problems with going to school. Doctor: Alright. It seems you developed repeat episodes of viral gastroenteritis over a two week period. How did that affect your eating habits? Susan: After that, I was convinced that eating caused my gastro-intestinal symptoms, so I started eating less and lost a lot of weight. Doctor: I understand that you underwent a full medical work-up, but no pathology was identified. Your parents tried to eliminate foods that could exacerbate your abdominal pain and nausea, but it had limited effect. Is that correct? Susan: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: So, you were admitted to the pediatric ward weighing 75.8% of your target growth weight (TGW) with a BMI of 11.8 kg/m2. While there, you were initially nourished with liquid nutrition (Ensure) via a nasogastric (NG) tube. How did you feel about that? Susan: I didn't like it at all. My weight gain was very slow and difficult. Doctor: I see. It seems that you refused to eat or drink, and you would kick and scream and become hysterical whenever food was presented. You also screamed throughout the duration of your NG feeds. Is that correct? Susan: Yes, I just couldn't handle food at all. Doctor: One month after admission, the ED team was consulted and family therapy was initiated as your case history was felt to be in keeping with ARFID-aversive subtype. Have you noticed any improvements since starting therapy? Susan: A little bit, but it's still hard for me. Doctor: In addition to family therapy, you were treated with olanzapine to help with your severe agitation and anxiety. You started with 2.5 mg at night and the dose was gradually increased to 2.5 mg in the morning and 5 mg at night. How have you been feeling since starting this medication? Susan: It's helped with my anxiety and agitation. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. Both of your parents were convinced that this must be a medical problem. The therapist worked to empower and educate them, lift guilt and blame, and also to raise anxiety about the need for your parents to take control of your nutrition and help you to eat. How has their involvement been since starting therapy? Susan: They're trying their best to help me with my eating and nutrition. Doctor: That's great to hear, Susan. It's essential for your parents to take control and support you through this process. We will continue to monitor your progress and provide any necessary support. Let's work together towards your recovery. Susan: Thank you, doctor. I'll try my best. [/INST] S: Susan, a 10.9-year-old girl, reports feeling anxious and has a history of frequent stomach pains with no identified medical cause. She experienced significant weight loss due to a belief that eating worsens her gastrointestinal symptoms, following episodes of viral gastroenteritis. She expresses extreme distress related to eating, including kicking, screaming, and becoming hysterical when food is presented. O: Susan was admitted to the pediatric ward with a BMI of 11.8 kg/m2, weighing 75.8% of her target growth weight. Initial treatment included liquid nutrition via a nasogastric tube, which she poorly tolerated. No pathology was found in her medical work-up. Current medications include olanzapine, started at 2.5 mg at night, increased to 2.5 mg in the morning and 5 mg at night, which has helped reduce her anxiety and agitation. A: The primary diagnosis is Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID), aversive subtype. Differential diagnoses initially considered included gastrointestinal pathology, but were ruled out through extensive testing. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic with ongoing psychological and pharmacological treatment. P: Continue family therapy to support behavioral changes and improve Susan's eating habits. Maintain current olanzapine dosing to manage anxiety and agitation. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor weight, nutritional status, and psychological well-being. Educate and empower parents to take an active role in managing Susan's nutrition and support her recovery. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of no personal or family history of metabolic bone disorders. You have been referred to our institution for evaluation and treatment of a GCT of the jaw. Can you tell me when you were first diagnosed? Patient: Yeah, I was diagnosed back in 2015 when I went to my orthodontist because of a lower jaw lesion and difficulty chewing food. Doctor: I see. Did you have a CT scan at that time? Patient: Yes, I did. The CT scan showed an expansile lesion measuring 25 mm x 25 mm x 22 mm. Doctor: Hmm, I have the images here (Fig. A, B). The lesion was described as being lytic in nature and expansile. The buccal cortex was absent, and the lingual cortex was almost completely absent. Before establishing endocrine care, did you receive any treatment? Patient: Yeah, they gave me steroid injections with Kenalog 40 mg/mL weekly. Doctor: How long did you receive the injections for and what effect did they have on the tumor size? Patient: I had those injections for 6 weeks, but they didn't do much. The tumor size didn't change. Doctor: I see. Your initial laboratory workup was within normal limits, so they started you on denosumab 120 mg monthly. How was your experience with that treatment? Patient: I completed 7 months of treatment with no reported adverse events. It went pretty well. Doctor: That's good to hear. We have surveillance imaging repeated this year showing calcifications of the lesion (Fig. C, D). This is a positive development. We will continue to monitor your progress and determine any further treatment if necessary. Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. I'm glad to know things are improving. [/INST] S: The patient, diagnosed with a giant cell tumor (GCT) of the jaw in 2015, presented with a chief complaint of a lower jaw lesion and difficulty chewing. The patient has no personal or family history of metabolic bone disorders. Previous treatments included steroid injections (Kenalog 40 mg/mL weekly for 6 weeks) which did not alter the tumor size, followed by denosumab 120 mg monthly for 7 months, which was well-tolerated and led to calcification of the lesion. O: Initial CT scans in 2015 revealed an expansile, lytic lesion measuring 25 mm x 25 mm x 22 mm with absence of the buccal cortex and near absence of the lingual cortex. Recent surveillance imaging shows calcification of the lesion, indicating a positive response to the denosumab treatment. Initial laboratory workup was within normal limits. A: The primary diagnosis is a giant cell tumor of the jaw. The patient has shown a positive response to denosumab treatment as evidenced by the calcification of the lesion. No adverse events were reported with the treatment, and initial treatments with steroids were ineffective. P: Continue monitoring the patient's progress with regular follow-up visits and repeat imaging to assess the stability or further regression of the lesion. No additional treatment is planned at this time, but options will be reconsidered if there is any change in tumor status. Educate the patient on signs of potential complications and ensure compliance with follow-up appointments. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 77-year-old male patient with a history of myocardial infarction for half a year. Have you experienced any significant discomfort during this time? Patient: No, not really. I've been living a normal life at home without any major issues. Doctor: Alright. Can you tell me what happened two hours before you were admitted to the hospital? Patient: I suddenly developed significant palpitations and shortness of breath. It was really scary. Doctor: I see. You were then admitted to the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University by ambulance. When we examined you, your expression was painful, and we heard a distinct murmur in the precordium. We also performed an Electrocardiogram, which showed old left ventricular anteroseptal myocardial infarction. An X-ray confirmed an enlarged heart shadow. However, your myocardial enzymes and other laboratory test results showed no significant abnormalities.  Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: Echocardiography revealed that the interventricular septum was thinned near the apex and bulged toward the right ventricular side, with a rupture opening of about 8 mm in diameter visible on its top (Fig.). CDFI showed that left ventricular blood shunted to the right ventricle through the rupture (Fig.), with a shunt velocity measured by CW of about 410 cm/s, and a PG of 67 mmHg. Patient: Hmm, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it is. The echocardiography also showed left ventricular enlargement with an anteroposterior diameter of about 61 mm, significantly reduced wall motion amplitude, a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of about 33%, moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of about 60 mmHg. The echocardiographic diagnosis is old myocardial infarction of ventricular septal apex with ventricular septal rupture. Patient: So, what can be done about it, doc? Doctor: Due to your older age and reduced left ventricular function, surgical repair of the site of ventricular septal rupture would be very difficult. After multidisciplinary discussion, it was agreed that you couldn't undergo thoracotomy and were not suitable for thoracotomy. Instead, echocardiography guided interventional occlusion of the ruptured interventricular septum could be performed. Patient: I see. So, what's next? Doctor: We will need your family's consent for the interventional occlusion procedure. Once they have signed a written consent, we can proceed with the treatment. Patient: Okay, I'll talk to my family about it. (After obtaining the family's consent) Doctor: Great, we've received the consent. Under the guidance of transesophageal echocardiography, we will clearly display the ventricular septal rupture during the surgery. We will measure the size of the rupture again to ensure the proper occluder device is used to prevent it from falling off. Patient: I understand. Thank you, doctor. I hope the procedure goes well. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to provide you with the best possible care and treatment. [/INST] S: The 77-year-old male patient with a history of myocardial infarction reported sudden onset of palpitations and shortness of breath two hours before admission. He described the episode as scary but noted no significant discomfort in the months following his myocardial infarction until this event. O: Upon examination, the patient appeared in pain with a distinct murmur in the precordium. Electrocardiogram confirmed an old left ventricular anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Chest X-ray showed an enlarged heart shadow. Myocardial enzymes and other lab tests were normal. Echocardiography revealed a thinned interventricular septum near the apex bulging toward the right ventricular side with an 8 mm rupture. Left ventricular blood was noted to shunt to the right ventricle, with a shunt velocity of 410 cm/s and a pressure gradient of 67 mmHg. Additional findings included left ventricular enlargement, reduced wall motion amplitude, an ejection fraction of 33%, moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 60 mmHg. A: The primary diagnosis is an old myocardial infarction with ventricular septal rupture. The patient's age and reduced left ventricular function make surgical repair challenging. Differential diagnoses were considered but ruled out based on imaging and lab results. P: The management plan includes echocardiography-guided interventional occlusion of the ruptured interventricular septum, as the patient is not a candidate for thoracotomy. The procedure will proceed following family consent, which has been obtained. The size of the rupture will be measured again during surgery to ensure the correct occluder device is used. The patient and family will be kept informed throughout the process to ensure understanding and compliance with the treatment plan. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you have brought in your 11-year-old neutered male Border Collie, Case 1, today. Can you tell me what symptoms he's been experiencing? Patient: Hi, doctor. My dog has been feeling pretty unwell lately. He doesn't have an appetite, seems very weak, and I've noticed some signs of internal bleeding. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's take a closer look. We'll perform an ultrasonography to see what's going on inside. [After ultrasonography] Doctor: The ultrasonography demonstrated a large renal mass and evidence of metastatic spread to the lungs. We'll need to do a biopsy of the renal mass to confirm the diagnosis. [After biopsy] Doctor: The histological examination of the biopsy revealed that your dog has a sarcoma of endothelial origin. We'll need to start him on a treatment plan right away. Under my care, we'll employ a research protocol using high dose oral DHEA (60 mg/kg/day) and ubiquinone (0.1 mg/kg/day) in divided daily doses. Patient: Okay, doctor. I hope this helps him feel better. Doctor: Within a few days of starting this protocol, your dog should experience a dramatic improvement in his quality of life, including appetite and playfulness. We'll have him reexamined at biweekly intervals and perform complete blood chemistry panels to monitor his progress. [After one month of treatment] Doctor: The repeat ultrasonography shows that there has been no further growth in the renal mass, indicating stable disease. However, your dog has developed a generalized inflammatory condition involving the skin, eyes, and nasal passages. The skin lesions range from nonpruritic maculopapular rash to urticaria, erythema nodosum, and purpura. The oral mucosa is inflamed, and uveitis is prominent. There's also episodic fever and an increase in his arthritis. Patient: Oh no, what could have caused this? Doctor: Since you mentioned that you've previously fed your dog large amounts of vegetable matter rich in phytates, we initially thought the inflammatory reaction was due to zinc deficiency caused by phytate sequestering of this critical metal. Zinc deficiency can produce symptoms very similar to those observed in this case. Patient: I see. Did giving him more zinc help improve his condition? Doctor: Unfortunately, zinc supplementation did not improve his condition, so we had to look for alternative causes for the inflammatory reaction. Doctor: Based on our earlier in vitro work, we considered the possibility that the autoinflammatory reaction might be due to inhibition of the mevalonate pathway. We found that this was the case and have decided to administer oral, encapsulated geraniol (60 mg/kg/day) to treat the inflammatory condition. Patient: I hope this treatment works. Thank you for all your help, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your dog's progress and make any necessary adjustments to his treatment plan. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns or if his condition worsens. [/INST] S: The patient, an 11-year-old neutered male Border Collie, presented with a lack of appetite, weakness, and signs of internal bleeding. The owner reported these symptoms as a recent development. O: Ultrasonography revealed a large renal mass with metastatic spread to the lungs. A biopsy confirmed the mass as a sarcoma of endothelial origin. Initial treatment with high dose oral DHEA (60 mg/kg/day) and ubiquinone (0.1 mg/kg/day) was started. Follow-up ultrasonography after one month showed stable disease, but the dog developed a generalized inflammatory condition with skin, eye, and nasal involvement, and episodic fever. Zinc supplementation was attempted without improvement. Further investigation linked the inflammation to inhibition of the mevalonate pathway. A: Primary diagnosis is renal sarcoma with lung metastasis. The dog developed a secondary autoinflammatory condition likely due to treatment. Differential diagnosis initially included zinc deficiency, which was ruled out with supplementation. P: The management plan includes continuing the current cancer treatment protocol and addressing the inflammatory condition with oral encapsulated geraniol (60 mg/kg/day). The patient will be monitored biweekly with complete blood chemistry panels to assess the treatment's efficacy and adjust as necessary. The owner is advised to watch for any worsening of symptoms and to maintain communication with the veterinary team. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, sir. You've been admitted to the emergency department after a high-velocity car accident. Can you tell me about any symptoms or pain you're experiencing? Patient: Yeah, I was ejected out of my vehicle during the accident. I've got this severe bleeding head wound, and I'm having trouble breathing. Doctor: I see. Your head wound is indeed severe. Your breathing is symmetric, and your abdominal findings, blood pressure, and saturation seem normal for now. However, we've noticed worsening bradypnea and bilateral rhonchi in your lungs. We'll need to do a chest X-ray. *After the chest X-ray* Doctor: The chest X-ray shows multiple left-sided rib fractures without pneumothorax, and blurry consolidations in both lungs, probably lung contusions. We need to stabilize you before proceeding with further tests. *After stabilization* Doctor: Now that you're stable, we'll perform a computed tomography (CT) of your head, followed by a total body CT from the circle of Willis up to the pelvis with a split bolus intravenous contrast injection. This will help us assess your condition better. *After the CT scans* Doctor: The CT study shows multiple intracranial subdural and subarachnoid bleedings, with secondary edema of the left hemisphere and a skull base fracture. Additionally, there are multiple rib fractures on the left side, without a notion of a flail chest, with underlying lung laceration and contusion. There are no signs of a haemothorax, hemopericardium, intra-abdominal bleeding, or laceration of the visceral organs. Patient: That sounds really bad, doc. What's next? Doctor: We've also performed a 12-lead ECG, and it demonstrates an acute myocardial infarction. We need to perform an urgent angiography to assess the situation. *After the angiography* Doctor: The angiography shows a complete occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA), probably due to a traumatic dissection. We've placed multiple stents in an attempt to approve reflow of the myocardium. Patient: Will that help? Doctor: Unfortunately, we were unable to establish reflow to the myocardial tissue. We'll do our best to manage your condition, but it's a very critical situation. *After the patient passes away* Doctor (to the patient's family): I'm very sorry to inform you that despite our efforts, the patient has passed away. On review of the trauma CT, we found the dissection of the RCA, which led to his unfortunate demise. Our thoughts are with you during this difficult time. [/INST] S: The patient, a male involved in a high-velocity car accident, reported being ejected from his vehicle. He complained of a severe bleeding head wound and difficulty breathing. O: Initial examination revealed a severe head wound, symmetric breathing, normal abdominal findings, blood pressure, and saturation. Noted worsening bradypnea and bilateral rhonchi. Chest X-ray indicated multiple left-sided rib fractures and blurry consolidations in both lungs, suggestive of lung contusions. CT scans showed multiple intracranial subdural and subarachnoid bleedings, secondary edema of the left hemisphere, a skull base fracture, multiple left-sided rib fractures, lung laceration and contusion, but no haemothorax, hemopericardium, intra-abdominal bleeding, or visceral organ laceration. A 12-lead ECG demonstrated an acute myocardial infarction. Angiography revealed a complete occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) due to traumatic dissection, with unsuccessful reflow post-stenting. A: The primary diagnosis was traumatic brain injury with intracranial bleedings, lung contusions, rib fractures, and acute myocardial infarction secondary to RCA dissection. Differential diagnoses included pneumothorax and internal bleeding, which were ruled out by imaging. P: The management plan included immediate stabilization, imaging studies (chest X-ray, head and total body CT), urgent angiography with stenting of the RCA, and intensive monitoring. Despite efforts, the patient succumbed to his injuries. The family was informed, and post-mortem discussions were held to review the findings and cause of death. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello there, I understand that you're a 54-year-old male with no comorbidities or significant social history. What brings you to the emergency department today? Patient: Hi, doctor. For the past three days, I've been having intermittent generalized abdominal pain that sometimes radiates to my back. Doctor: I see. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms lately? Patient: No, I haven't had any other symptoms. Doctor: Okay. Your presentation to the emergency department showed that you were hemodynamically stable. We conducted a physical examination and found that your abdomen was soft but had generalized tenderness, particularly in the epigastric region. Your initial lab results showed a WBC of 6.77 × 10^9/L, serum amylase of 79IU/L, urinary amylase of 738IU/L, CRP of 73.88 mg/L, D-dimer of 13.66ug/ml, and a lactate level of 1.87 mmol/L. Based on these results, we admitted you under the gastroenterology service for a suspected pancreatitis diagnosis. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We conducted a preliminary CT abdomen scan with oral and IV contrast, which showed acute pancreatitis and superior mesenteric and portal vein thrombosis. Fortunately, there was no evidence of mesenteric small bowel involvement. You were managed conservatively on the ward with heparin infusion, which was later switched to LMWH and warfarin. Patient: Okay, what happened after that? Doctor: A week later, you developed sustained tachycardia and a sudden drop in WBC. Your lactate levels also increased to 5.31IU/L. A follow-up CT abdomen scan with IV contrast revealed diffuse wall thickening involving multiple loops of the jejunum, which was highly suspicious of bowel ischemia. Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it was a concerning finding. We decided to proceed with an exploratory laparotomy. During the procedure, we found no evidence of full thickness necrosis but did observe characteristics of small bowel edema secondary to SMV thrombosis. Additionally, your pancreas appeared inflamed and edematous, with evidence of intraperitoneal calcification within the lesser sac. An ABthera vacuum dressing was applied in anticipation of a second-look laparotomy. Patient: What happened after that? Doctor: You were shifted to the ICU, where you showed evidence of progressive acute hepatic failure with rising INR, bilirubin, and serum ammonia levels. On re-evaluation of your bowel within 48 hours, we noted viable but dusky appearing jejunum. An access sheath was inserted retrograde from the middle colic vein into the superior mesenteric vein and portal vein, and a catheter was placed for direct thrombolysis. Patient: What does that mean for my condition? Doctor: The procedure was performed to help dissolve the clot and improve blood flow to the affected areas. We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide appropriate treatment as needed. Your medical team will discuss any further steps or follow-up requirements with you. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient is a 54-year-old male presenting with intermittent generalized abdominal pain for three days, radiating to the back. He reports no other symptoms and has no significant comorbidities or social history. O: On examination, the patient was hemodynamically stable with a soft abdomen but generalized tenderness, particularly in the epigastric region. Initial labs showed WBC 6.77 × 10^9/L (normal: 4.0-11.0 × 10^9/L), serum amylase 79 IU/L (normal: 28-100 IU/L), urinary amylase 738 IU/L (normal: <530 IU/L), CRP 73.88 mg/L (normal: <5 mg/L), D-dimer 13.66 ug/ml (normal: <0.50 ug/ml), and lactate 1.87 mmol/L (normal: 0.5-1.6 mmol/L). CT abdomen with contrast indicated acute pancreatitis and superior mesenteric and portal vein thrombosis without mesenteric small bowel involvement. Follow-up CT showed diffuse wall thickening in multiple loops of the jejunum, suggestive of bowel ischemia. Exploratory laparotomy findings included small bowel edema and inflamed, edematous pancreas with intraperitoneal calcification. ICU monitoring revealed acute hepatic failure with elevated INR, bilirubin, and serum ammonia. A: The primary diagnosis is acute pancreatitis complicated by superior mesenteric and portal vein thrombosis, leading to bowel ischemia and acute hepatic failure. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of abdominal pain and elevated inflammatory markers, but imaging and lab results support the current diagnosis. P: The patient was managed with heparin infusion, switched to LMWH and warfarin. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, and an ABthera vacuum dressing was applied. In the ICU, retrograde catheter placement for direct thrombolysis was conducted to improve mesenteric and portal vein blood flow. Ongoing management includes close monitoring in the ICU, adjustment of anticoagulation therapy as needed, and potential second-look laparotomy. Further consultations with gastroenterology, surgery, and hepatology are planned. Education regarding the importance of adherence to the treatment plan and recognition of symptoms indicating complications will be provided to ensure patient compliance and awareness. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you're a 30-year-old nulliparous woman with no medical history. Have you been regularly screened with a PAP-smear test? Patient: Yes, I have been getting regular PAP-smear tests. Doctor: I see that you presented with postcoital metrorrhagia. We diagnosed an in situ carcinoma based on the cervical biopsies we took. The MRI and abdominal CT imaging we performed were normal. Can you tell me if you have experienced any other symptoms? Patient: No, I haven't experienced any other symptoms. Doctor: We performed a large loop cervical excision and endometrial curettage, which confirmed the presence of a well differentiated HPV18-related in situ adenocarcinoma and high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN III) with negative surgical margins. We didn't observe any obvious infiltration on the examined slides. Patient: Hmm, I see. Doctor: Nine years later, you experienced abdominal pain. We performed ultrasound imaging and discovered a 9.5 cm complex left adnexal mass. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: We then conducted an examination of the laparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy, which revealed mucinous cystadenoma of the intestinal type with borderline character traits and extensive foci of intraepithelial carcinoma. Patient: Oh, okay.  Doctor: Seventeen months after that, we found a 10 cm right ovarian mass. We performed a total hysterectomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy, and omentectomy. This revealed a 2.5 cm HPV18-related cervical cancer extending to the uterine isthmus with mucinous proliferation of intestinal type involving the cervix and right ovary. Unfortunately, the HPV insertion site could not be determined due to insufficient tumor tissue. Patient: I see. Doctor: A month later, you were referred to our oncologic surgery department. We performed complementary laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomies. During the laparoscopy, we discovered carcinomatous metastasis and intestinal involvement. Patient: Oh no. Doctor: We treated you with FOLFOX chemotherapy for 3 months and then performed a complete cytoreductive surgery with peritonectomy, multiple bowel resections, and intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy due to a partial response to chemotherapy. Patient: Yes, I remember that. Doctor: The examination of the resected tissues showed carcinomatous cells partly modified by chemotherapy and a high mitotic index (Ki 67: 70%). You are currently on follow-up. Make sure to continue attending your follow-up appointments and let us know if you experience any new symptoms or concerns. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I will continue with my follow-up appointments and inform you if anything changes. [/INST] S: The patient is a 30-year-old nulliparous woman with a history of regular PAP-smear screenings. She initially presented with postcoital metrorrhagia and was diagnosed with HPV18-related in situ adenocarcinoma and high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN III). She reported no other symptoms initially. Nine years later, she experienced abdominal pain and was found to have a 9.5 cm complex left adnexal mass. Seventeen months after that, a 10 cm right ovarian mass was discovered. O: Initial cervical biopsies confirmed well-differentiated in situ adenocarcinoma and CIN III with negative surgical margins. MRI and abdominal CT were normal. Ultrasound imaging revealed a 9.5 cm left adnexal mass. Laparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy showed mucinous cystadenoma of the intestinal type with borderline traits and extensive foci of intraepithelial carcinoma. A subsequent total hysterectomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy, and omentectomy revealed a 2.5 cm HPV18-related cervical cancer extending to the uterine isthmus with mucinous proliferation involving the cervix and right ovary. Complementary laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomies discovered carcinomatous metastasis and intestinal involvement. Resected tissues showed carcinomatous cells partly modified by chemotherapy with a high mitotic index (Ki 67: 70%). A: The primary diagnosis is HPV18-related cervical cancer with subsequent metastasis and intestinal involvement. Differential diagnoses included mucinous cystadenoma and intraepithelial carcinoma. The prognosis is guarded due to the extensive nature of the disease and metastasis. P: The patient underwent a large loop cervical excision, endometrial curettage, total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy, omentectomy, and multiple bowel resections. She received FOLFOX chemotherapy followed by complete cytoreductive surgery with peritonectomy and intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy. She is currently on follow-up and advised to continue attending follow-up appointments and report any new symptoms or concerns. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see from your past medical history that you have hypertension, diabetes, and schizophrenia. What brings you to the ED today? Patient: I've been having an altered mental status and acting combative at home. My family said I've been hallucinating too. Doctor: I see. Have there been any recent changes to your medications? Patient: Yeah, my doctor changed my medication to haloperidol recently. Doctor: When you arrived at the ED, you presented lethargic with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 4, foaming from the oropharynx, and rigid. Your intravesical temperature was 109.6°F, blood pressure was 143/129 mmHg, pulse was 133 bpm, respiratory rate was 12 breaths per minute and irregular, and you had 100% saturation on high oxygen flow via nasal cannula.  Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it is. Your total creatine kinase was 28,482 U/L and troponin was 0.75 ng/mL with ECG revealing lateral depressions. We intubated you for airway protection and immediately cooled you with evaporative cooling measures. We also managed your rhabdomyolysis with vigorous hydration. Patient: What about my heart? Doctor: The cardiology team determined that you were not stable enough for urgent cardiac catheterization, so a heparin drip was started. Given your hyperthermia and muscle rigidity, we suspected NMS and administered an intravenous 1 mg/kg bolus of dantrolene in the ED. Patient: So, what's next for me? Doctor: You were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of NMS, rhabdomyolysis, respiratory failure, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The ICU treatment team began bromocriptine at a dose of 2.5mg per nasal gastric tube every six hours per neurology recommendations and cooling through Arctic Sun 5000 Temperature Management System™. Patient: Is there anything else going on with me? Doctor: Yes, you also experienced multi-organ insult including hepatic shock and acute renal failure. You continued to experience labile temperatures with episodic fevers. However, blood and urine cultures and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were unremarkable. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: It means we will continue to monitor and treat you in the ICU. The main focus is to stabilize your condition and address the various complications you're experiencing. We'll also work on adjusting your medications to prevent this from happening again. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all the help and care you're providing. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to keep you and your family updated on your progress and any changes in your treatment plan. Rest assured, we're doing everything we can to help you recover.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. Can you please tell me about the symptoms your 8-month-old son has been experiencing? Parent: Hi, Doctor. My son has been having this laryngeal inspiratory stridor and we noticed some suprasternal notch and subdiaphragmatic retraction. Doctor: I see. Based on your description, it seems like your son's condition is quite severe. We'll need to use the Westley's scale to assess his condition. His score is 11, which indicates a severe case. Parent: Oh no, what does that mean for my son? Doctor: It means that he is experiencing severe acute respiratory failure. His respiratory frequency is at 70 breaths per minute and his heart rate is higher than 200 beats per minute. Due to this, we had to perform tracheal intubation and have him referred to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU). Parent: I remember that he had a similar issue when he was born. He was intubated for 17 days in the pediatric ICU due to early respiratory distress. He had a tracheal extubation failure during that hospitalization but eventually recovered. Doctor: Yes, I have his personal history here. Since his condition is severe, we have introduced dexamethasone at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg/day on the first day of hospitalization. He is also on mechanical ventilation and receiving ventilator support with specific settings: fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 0.25; inspiratory time of 0.79 seconds; respiratory frequency at 30 bpm; positive end expiratory pressure at 5 cmH2O; pressure support at 14 cmH2O; pressure control at 16 cmH2O; and current volume at 85 mL. Parent: Is he also on any other medications? Doctor: Yes, he is on midazolam at 0.2 mg/kg/h and fentanyl at 2 mcg/kg/h. Fortunately, he does not require any vasoactive medication and is clinically stable. Parent: That's good to hear. How long do you think he will need to stay intubated? Doctor: We performed a flexible bronchoscopy six days after hospitalization to assess the conditions of his mucosa before considering extubation. The bronchoscopy revealed major mucosal edema, which means he still needs the ventilator support for now. Parent: Thank you, Doctor. I really hope he gets better soon. Doctor: We'll continue to closely monitor his condition and provide the necessary treatment. We'll keep you updated on his progress. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions or concerns. [/INST] S: The patient, an 8-month-old male, presents with laryngeal inspiratory stridor, suprasternal notch, and subdiaphragmatic retraction. The parent reports a history of similar respiratory issues shortly after birth, requiring prolonged intubation and ICU care due to early respiratory distress and tracheal extubation failure. O: Current assessment using Westley's scale scores the patient at 11, indicating severe acute respiratory failure. Vital signs include a respiratory frequency of 70 breaths per minute and a heart rate exceeding 200 beats per minute. The patient is intubated and in the pediatric ICU, receiving mechanical ventilation with settings: FiO2 at 0.25, inspiratory time of 0.79 seconds, respiratory frequency at 30 bpm, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, pressure support at 14 cmH2O, pressure control at 16 cmH2O, and tidal volume at 85 mL. Medications include dexamethasone at 0.6 mg/kg/day, midazolam at 0.2 mg/kg/h, and fentanyl at 2 mcg/kg/h. A recent flexible bronchoscopy showed significant mucosal edema. A: The primary diagnosis is severe acute respiratory failure with complications of major mucosal edema. The patient's history of neonatal respiratory distress and previous intubation failures are significant for his current condition and management. P: Continue current ventilator support and medication regimen. Closely monitor the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status in the pediatric ICU. Reassess the need for ongoing intubation based on respiratory status and mucosal healing. Keep the parent informed about the patient's progress and address any concerns. Plan for a gradual weaning process from the ventilator when clinically appropriate, with consideration for potential challenges given the patient's past medical history. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, how can I help you today? Patient: I've developed a problem on the right side of my tongue. It's been bothering me for a while. Doctor: I see. Can you describe the lesion for me? Patient: It's a small bump, about 0.7 x 0.4 cm in size. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Do you smoke or have a history of alcohol consumption? Patient: No, I'm a non-smoker and I don't drink alcohol. Doctor: And are you currently pregnant? Patient: Yes, I'm 22 weeks pregnant. Doctor: Hmm, okay. In consultation with the doctor in charge of obstetrics and gynecology, we have decided to use certain drugs for your perioperative management. These include cefazolin or cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride as antibiotics and flurbiprofen axetil and diclofenac sodium as analgesics. Patient: Alright, what's the next step? Doctor: At 25 weeks of pregnancy, we will perform a trans-oral partial glossectomy under general anesthesia. A pathologic examination will then be conducted to confirm the diagnosis. Patient: What kind of anesthesia will be used? Doctor: We will use remifentanil hydrochloride, thiamylal sodium, and sevoflurane for anesthetic induction, and remifentanil hydrochloride and oxygen in air for maintenance of general anesthesia. Lidocaine 1% with adrenaline (epinephrine) 1:300,000 will be used for local anesthesia. Patient: And what about postoperative care? Doctor: To prevent postoperative infection, we'll administer cefazolin and cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride. Acetaminophen will be used for analgesia. We will also use ultrasonic examination to monitor the fetus intraoperatively. Patient: How long will the operation take? Doctor: The operation time will be around 1 hour and 13 minutes, and the anesthesia time will be approximately 2 hours and 22 minutes. Patient: What can I expect after the operation? Doctor: Your postoperative course should be uneventful, and you should be able to deliver a healthy baby about four months after the operation. Patient: That's a relief. How likely is it that the disease will come back? Doctor: Based on your current condition, the chances of recurrence are low. Six years after the final operation, you should still be free of the disease. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, doc. I've been having worsening left flank pain for about a year now, along with some visible blood in my urine sometimes. I also feel a fullness in my left flank. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently? Patient: Yes, I've had a loss of appetite and I've lost a lot of weight. I've also been treated by my local doctor for recurrent urinary tract infections. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Let's start with a clinical examination. *performs examination* I can feel an ill-defined mass in your left flank, and it seems to be causing you pain on palpation. Patient: Ouch, yeah that's the spot. Doctor: We will need to do some laboratory work and an abdominal CT scan to get a better understanding of what's going on. *conducts tests* The lab work shows a normocytic, normochromic anemia, but the rest is unremarkable. However, the CT scan reveals a large soft tissue mass measuring about 108x106x105 mm in your left kidney. Patient: Oh no, that sounds bad. Doctor: It's concerning, but we need more information. The ureter and renal artery are poorly visualized, and the renal vein is not well demonstrated. However, there's no evidence of metastatic spread to your adrenal glands, lymph nodes, liver, or chest. We also didn't find any bladder lesions during the cystoscopy. Patient: So what's the diagnosis, doc? Doctor: Based on these findings, we have a tentative diagnosis of RCC, stage cT3aN0M0. Our plan is to perform a hand-assisted laparoscopic radical nephrectomy to remove the affected kidney. Patient: Okay, I understand. Doctor: Intraoperatively, we found a large left lower pole renal mass and a bulky, dilated proximal ureter. We decided to proceed with a radical nephrectomy and ureterectomy. The ureter was mobilized and divided at the level of the pelvic brim. Patient: Did you find any enlarged lymph nodes during the surgery? Doctor: No, we didn't find any enlargement of lymph nodes on preoperative imaging or when we palpated them intraoperatively. As a result, we didn't perform a lymph node dissection. Patient: That's a relief. Doctor: Your postoperative course went smoothly, and we were able to discharge you four days after surgery. We'll continue to monitor your recovery and follow up with any necessary care. Patient: Thank you for all your help, doc. I appreciate it. [/INST] S: The patient reports a year-long history of worsening left flank pain, visible hematuria, and a sensation of fullness in the left flank. Additionally, the patient has experienced a loss of appetite, significant weight loss, and recurrent urinary tract infections treated by a local doctor. O: Physical examination revealed an ill-defined mass in the left flank, painful on palpation. Laboratory tests showed normocytic, normochromic anemia; other results were unremarkable. Abdominal CT scan identified a large soft tissue mass (108x106x105 mm) in the left kidney, with poor visualization of the ureter and renal artery, and no evidence of metastatic spread. Intraoperative findings confirmed a large left lower pole renal mass and a bulky, dilated proximal ureter. Radical nephrectomy and ureterectomy were performed without lymph node dissection due to no evidence of lymph node enlargement. Postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged four days after surgery. A: Primary diagnosis of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC), stage cT3aN0M0, based on imaging and surgical findings. Differential diagnoses were considered but ruled out based on imaging and clinical findings. P: The patient underwent a hand-assisted laparoscopic radical nephrectomy and ureterectomy. Postoperative recovery was smooth, and the patient was discharged with instructions for follow-up care. Ongoing monitoring and regular follow-ups are planned to manage and monitor recovery and detect any recurrence early. Further treatment options may be considered based on follow-up assessments and recovery progress. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've been admitted to the emergency department with a fever of unknown origin for 1 month. Can you tell me about your medical history? Patient: Well, I had a stroke, but I don't have any history of neoplasm, trauma, chemo, radiation, or other surgeries. Doctor: I noticed you have a catheter in situ. When was it inserted? Patient: It was inserted a year ago because of dysuria. The catheter is changed regularly, every 4-5 days. Doctor: How long has it been since your present catheter was inserted? Patient: It was put in 4 days ago. Doctor: And have you noticed any changes in your urine color? Patient: Yes, it gradually turned dark green after the catheter was changed. Doctor: Okay, after your presentation to the hospital, we conducted some laboratory tests. Your white blood cell count is elevated at 17,900/μL, and your C-reactive protein is at 5.70mg/dL. In your urine analysis, pyuria was seen. We also performed an abdominopelvic computed tomography (APCT). Patient: What did the APCT show? Doctor: The APCT revealed no evidence of urinary tract infection or acute pyelonephritis. However, it showed malposition of your Foley catheter, which was located along the urethra-prostate-rectum. Also, there's a prostatic abscess bulging and abutting the anterior wall of your rectum. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We diagnosed you with a recto-urethral fistula (RUF), which is caused by the prostatic abscess. It's an abnormal connection between the rectum and urethra. This condition can be a rare complication of pelvic surgery, radiation, trauma, or infection/inflammation. The incidence of RUF has been increasing due to more surgeries and pelvic irradiation performed for genitourinary neoplasm. Patient: How will you treat it? Doctor: We've started you on intravenous antibiotics, and we will also perform a percutaneous nephrostomy for urine diversion. However, fecal diversion will not be performed as there's no fecaluria present. Patient: How long will the treatment take? Doctor: The treatment should take around three months. You'll be undergoing conservative treatment with pyelostomies. Patient: And what happens after the treatment? Doctor: After the treatment, we'll reinsert the Foley catheter and discharge you from the hospital. The early diagnosis of RUF using APCT in the emergency setting is crucial not only for confirming the diagnosis and initiating appropriate medical management but also for ensuring pre-operative localization in patients, if necessary. [/INST] S: Patient, a known case of stroke with a history of chronic catheter use due to dysuria, presents with a one-month history of fever of unknown origin. Reports dark green urine following recent catheter change four days ago. Denies history of neoplasm, trauma, chemotherapy, radiation, or surgeries. O: Vital signs include elevated temperature. Laboratory findings show elevated white blood cell count at 17,900/μL (normal: 4500-11,000/μL) and C-reactive protein at 5.70 mg/dL (normal: <0.5 mg/dL). Urine analysis indicates pyuria. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (APCT) reveals malpositioned Foley catheter and a prostatic abscess causing a recto-urethral fistula (RUF), with no evidence of urinary tract infection or acute pyelonephritis. A: Primary diagnosis of recto-urethral fistula secondary to prostatic abscess, likely exacerbated by chronic catheter use. Differential diagnosis initially included urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis, which were ruled out by APCT. P: Initiated treatment with intravenous antibiotics and percutaneous nephrostomy for urine diversion. Conservative treatment with pyelostomies planned for approximately three months. Post-treatment, plans include reinsertion of Foley catheter and hospital discharge. Emphasis on early diagnosis and management of RUF to prevent complications and prepare for potential surgical intervention if necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi doc, I presented to the emergency department because I had two episodes of coffee-ground vomiting. I didn't have any pain, dizziness, or syncope though. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms, like melena? Patient: Yes, I've had two episodes of melena in the past, and I had argon plasma coagulation (APC) for prior gastrointestinal angioectasias. Doctor: Do you have any other medical comorbidities or significant family history? Patient: I have chronic alcoholism, cirrhosis, and hypertension (HTN). There's no notable family history. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. I'd like to check your vitals. Your blood pressure is 115/70 mmHg and your heart rate is 98 bpm while supine. When standing, your blood pressure is 93/65 mmHg and your heart rate is 110 bpm. You appear afebrile, alert, and oriented to time, person, and location. Patient: Okay, doc. Doctor: During the physical examination, I noticed multiple spider nevi and a cherry angioma. Your abdominal examination showed shifting dullness and caput medusae, but there was no abdominal tenderness or asterixis. Your neurological exam was unremarkable. Patient: Hmm, I see. Doctor: Your hemoglobin level at the time of admission was 6.5 g/dl, compared to the baseline 11 g/dl measured three months ago. We resuscitated you with intravenous fluid and blood transfusion. Patient: Oh, alright. Doctor: We also conducted an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed surface nodularity and increased echogenicity with irregular appearing areas consistent with cirrhosis. Your Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is 13, and your Child Turcotte Pugh score (CTP) is 10. Patient: Hmm, that's concerning. Doctor: We performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and found multiple angioectasias in your gastric body, antrum, and the first part of your duodenum. Patient: Oh no, what does that mean? Doctor: Since you've had two earlier sessions of APC in prior admissions without improvement and a recurrence of melena, we recommend medical therapy with thalidomide as an alternative treatment option. Patient: I'm not very comfortable with that. What are the risks and benefits of thalidomide? Doctor: Thalidomide can be effective in treating angioectasias, but it may have side effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, and an increased risk of blood clots. We will closely monitor you and adjust the treatment if needed. It's important to weigh the potential benefits and risks before making a decision. Patient: I understand. I'll think about it and let you know my decision. Doctor: That's perfectly fine. Take your time and feel free to ask any questions you may have. We're here to help you make the best decision for your health.

He has undergone argon plasma coagulation for gastrointestinal angioectasias in the past. He denies experiencing pain, dizziness, or syncope. O: Vital signs showed orthostatic changes with a blood pressure of 115/70 mmHg supine and 93/65 mmHg standing, and heart rates of 98 bpm supine and 110 bpm standing. Physical examination revealed multiple spider nevi, cherry angioma, shifting dullness, and caput medusae, but no abdominal tenderness or asterixis. Neurological examination was unremarkable. Hemoglobin was significantly reduced at 6.5 g/dl from a baseline of 11 g/dl. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed cirrhosis with surface nodularity and increased echogenicity. MELD score was 13, and CTP score was 10. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy identified multiple angioectasias in the gastric body, antrum, and duodenum. A: The primary diagnosis is gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to angioectasias in the context of cirrhosis. Differential diagnoses could include other sources of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's history of chronic alcoholism and cirrhosis complicates his condition, increasing the risk of recurrent bleeding and other complications. P: The management plan includes medical therapy with thalidomide as an alternative to further APC, considering the recurrence of symptoms post-previous interventions. The patient will be educated on the risks and benefits of thalidomide, including potential side effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, and thromboembolism. Close monitoring will be necessary to adjust treatment as needed.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see here that you have a 12-year-old male castrated domestic shorthair cat that was referred to the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH). Can you tell me more about the reason for the referral? Patient: Yes, my cat has been experiencing weight loss for about 10 months and anemia for 3 weeks. Doctor: I see. Were there any abnormalities identified by your primary veterinarian before the referral? Patient: Yes, they noticed a thin body condition and a grade II/VI holosystolic heart murmur 3 weeks prior to admission. Doctor: Did your primary veterinarian run any tests on your cat? Patient: Yes, they did a serum biochemical profile and total thyroxine test, which were within normal limits. They also did a complete blood count (CBC). Doctor: What were the results of the CBC? Patient: The CBC showed a normocytic, normochromic, regenerative anemia with a hematocrit of 17.2% and 66,500 reticulocytes/μl. It also showed thrombocytopenia with 142,000 platelets/μl. Doctor: Did your veterinarian test for any specific causes of the anemia? Patient: Yes, they submitted a PCR panel testing for Mycoplasma haemofelis, Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis, and Candidatus Mycoplasma haemomintum. Doctor: While waiting for the PCR results, did your cat receive any treatment? Patient: Yes, the vet prescribed orbifloxacin at 3.4 mg/kg by mouth once daily and some oral vitamin B supplementation. But I'm not sure about the type and dose of the vitamin B. Doctor: How did your cat respond to the treatment? Patient: A week later, the CBC showed improved normocytic and normochromic anemia and reticulocytosis with 21% hematocrit and 94,600 reticulocytes/μl. The thrombocytopenia also resolved with 159,000 platelets/μl. Doctor: And what were the results of the PCR panel? Patient: The PCR panel came back negative. Doctor: Did your cat continue the orbifloxacin and vitamin B supplementation? Patient: Yes, the vet decided to continue the treatment since there was clinical improvement. Doctor: How has your cat's anemia progressed over the past two weeks? Patient: The packed cell volume has been ranging from 20.1–22.5% and the reticulocyte count has been between 58,000–80,600 reticulocytes/μl. Doctor: Thank you for providing all this information. We'll continue to monitor your cat's progress and adjust treatments as necessary. Please keep us updated on any changes in your cat's condition. [/INST] S: The patient, a 12-year-old male castrated domestic shorthair cat, presented with a 10-month history of weight loss and 3-week history of anemia. The primary veterinarian noted a thin body condition and a grade II/VI holosystolic heart murmur. The owner reported compliance with prescribed treatments but was unsure about the specifics of the vitamin B supplementation. O: On examination, the primary veterinarian's findings included normocytic, normochromic, regenerative anemia with a hematocrit of 17.2% and 66,500 reticulocytes/μl, and thrombocytopenia with 142,000 platelets/μl. A PCR panel for Mycoplasma species was negative. Treatment with orbifloxacin at 3.4 mg/kg orally once daily and unspecified oral vitamin B supplementation led to partial improvement: hematocrit increased to 21%, reticulocyte count to 94,600 reticulocytes/μl, and platelet count normalized to 159,000 platelets/μl. Recent labs showed packed cell volume ranging from 20.1–22.5% and reticulocyte count between 58,000–80,600 reticulocytes/μl. A: The primary diagnosis is normocytic, normochromic, regenerative anemia with a history of thrombocytopenia, currently stable under treatment. Differential diagnoses initially included hemotropic Mycoplasma infections, which have been ruled out by PCR. The heart murmur may be an incidental finding but could be related to underlying cardiac or systemic disease. P: Continue monitoring hematologic parameters and packed cell volume regularly. Maintain current treatment with orbifloxacin and vitamin B supplementation, ensuring proper dosing and administration of vitamin B. Re-evaluate the heart murmur with an echocardiogram if there is any clinical deterioration or if the murmur progresses. Educate the owner on the importance of monitoring and timely reporting of any new symptoms or changes in the cat's condition. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Patient: Hey doctor, I've been having this right lumbago for about a month now. Doctor: I see. Have you had any tests done to identify the cause? Patient: Yeah, I recently underwent B mode ultrasonography. Doctor: What were the results of the ultrasonography? Patient: The results showed a lower echo mass in the lower pole of my right kidney. Doctor: I see. The report mentions that the tumor is 5.4 × 4.8 cm in size, with an irregular shape and no clear boundary. The internal echo is also uneven. Based on these findings, you were admitted to the hospital for further examination. We performed a middle abdomen plain and enhanced CT scan, which showed a round tumor of 5.2 × 4.9 cm with a clear boundary and uneven density (Fig. A).  Patient: Oh, that sounds concerning. What was the next step? Doctor: We decided to perform a laparoscopic radical nephrectomy to remove the right kidney tumor. Upon removal, we observed that the tumor had pigmentation and a clear tumor boundary. Patient: What did you find out about the tumor? Doctor: The tumor was identified as a translocation of XP11.2 tumor associated with pigment differentiation, which has a low malignant biological behavior. Immunohistochemistry tests were conducted, and the results showed positive for HMB45, Melan-A, S100, Ki67, and TFE3. Patient: So, what does that mean for me? Doctor: It means that the tumor was successfully removed, and its low malignant behavior indicates that it is less likely to spread aggressively. We'll continue to monitor your condition closely. Patient: That's a relief! How am I doing after the operation? Doctor: After 3 months of the operation, there has been no recurrence of the tumor, and you have not required any other treatment. Patient: Wow, that's great news! Thank you so much, doctor! Doctor: You're welcome. We'll keep an eye on your progress and schedule regular follow-ups to ensure your continued good health. [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing right lumbago for about a month. He underwent B mode ultrasonography, which revealed a mass in the lower pole of his right kidney. O: Ultrasonography showed a 5.4 × 4.8 cm tumor with an irregular shape and no clear boundary, and uneven internal echo. Subsequent middle abdomen plain and enhanced CT scan indicated a round tumor of 5.2 × 4.9 cm with a clear boundary and uneven density. A laparoscopic radical nephrectomy was performed, and the tumor was identified as a translocation of XP11.2 tumor with pigment differentiation. Immunohistochemistry tests were positive for HMB45, Melan-A, S100, Ki67, and TFE3. A: The primary diagnosis is a translocation of XP11.2 tumor associated with pigment differentiation, characterized by low malignant biological behavior. The successful surgical removal and the immunohistochemistry findings suggest a favorable prognosis with low likelihood of aggressive spread. P: The patient underwent successful laparoscopic radical nephrectomy with no recurrence of the tumor after 3 months. Regular follow-ups are scheduled to monitor the patient's condition and ensure continued good health. No additional treatment has been required post-operation. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Patient: Hi doctor, I'm not feeling well and I have some concerning symptoms. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you please describe your symptoms? Patient: Well, I've had 2 episodes of unprovoked syncope, nausea, somnolence, and my left-sided weakness seems to be getting worse. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. I see that you presented to the emergency department 3 weeks after a right frontal nodule resection of your multifocal glioblastoma multiforme. How has your recovery been since the surgery? Patient: Yeah, the recovery went well. I still have some residual weakness on my left side, but I was able to ambulate using a walker when I was discharged. Doctor: That's good to know. It's important to be aware of your past medical history, which includes controlled hypertension and epilepsy. Are you currently taking any medications to manage these conditions? Patient: Yes, I'm taking dexamethasone, levetiracetam, hydromorphone, perindopril, amlodipine, and pantoprazole. Doctor: Thank you for the information. While you were in the emergency room, the cardiac monitor showed a temporary pause, which was symptomatic. At admission, your vital signs were recorded as a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, blood pressure of 132/86, heart rate of 61, and respiratory rate of 18 (regular). You were afebrile and had an oxygen saturation of 94% on 2 L/min of oxygen. When the oxygen was removed, your respiratory rate dropped to 12, oxygen saturation dropped to 89%, and you became nonalert. Do you recall experiencing this? Patient: Yes, I remember feeling short of breath and a bit disoriented when they took the oxygen away. Doctor: I see. An EKG was performed, which showed multiple intermittent sinus pauses with durations of 4–6 seconds. Your blood work and urine analysis were within the normal range. Based on this information, we made a diagnosis of SSS and admitted you to the CCU for pacemaker implantation.  Patient: So, will I be getting a pacemaker? Doctor: Yes, that's correct. While in the CCU, your EKG showed intermittent sinus pauses with the longest duration of around 3.6 seconds. A pacemaker was inserted to address this issue.  Patient: How did it go after the pacemaker was put in? Doctor: The 24-hour monitoring post-procedure was uneventful, and your telemetry showed a significant improvement in your heart rhythm. You should continue to monitor your symptoms and follow up with your healthcare team to ensure the pacemaker is working as intended. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all the help. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care of yourself and continue to focus on your recovery. [/INST] S: The patient reported experiencing two episodes of unprovoked syncope, nausea, somnolence, and worsening left-sided weakness. The patient has a history of multifocal glioblastoma multiforme with a recent right frontal nodule resection, controlled hypertension, and epilepsy. The patient is currently on dexamethasone, levetiracetam, hydromorphone, perindopril, amlodipine, and pantoprazole. O: The patient presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, blood pressure of 132/86 mmHg, heart rate of 61 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 2 L/min of oxygen. Upon oxygen removal, the patient's respiratory rate decreased to 12, oxygen saturation dropped to 89%, and the patient became nonalert. EKG showed multiple intermittent sinus pauses lasting 4–6 seconds. Blood work and urine analysis were within normal limits. The patient was admitted to the CCU for pacemaker implantation due to symptomatic sinus pauses. A: The primary diagnosis is sick sinus syndrome (SSS), likely exacerbated by the patient's recent surgery and underlying conditions. The differential diagnosis includes complications from glioblastoma and side effects of medications. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic with the pacemaker in place, but close monitoring is required given the patient's complex medical history. P: The patient underwent successful pacemaker implantation to manage the sinus pauses. Post-procedure, the patient showed improved heart rhythm on telemetry. The patient is advised to continue with current medications and monitor for any new or worsening symptoms. Regular follow-ups with the neurology and cardiology teams are necessary to manage the underlying glioblastoma and newly diagnosed SSS. Education on recognizing signs of pacemaker malfunction or infection is crucial. Further adjustments in therapy may be needed based on ongoing assessments and symptomatology. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I remember you underwent a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy recently. How have you been feeling since the surgery? Patient: Hi, doctor. After the surgery, I had mild pain in my left iliac fossa. I was taking paracetamol and oral morphine for the pain. Doctor: I see, and you have a history of total abdominal hysterectomy 20 years prior for endometriosis, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: During your recent surgery, there were adhesions obscuring the anatomy of your left ureter due to your prior surgery. In the early postoperative days, you didn't have any flank pain or costovertebral angle tenderness, right? Patient: No, I didn't. But one week later, I had severe left iliac fossa pain, nausea, and vomiting, so I went to the emergency department. Doctor: Yes, I see that in your records. Your investigations showed a normal range of renal function and inflammatory markers. However, a contrast CT revealed extravasation of the contrast at the level of the left renal pelvis and ureteric dilatation down to the pelvic ureter. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. Doctor: Due to your recent pelvic surgery, an immediate diagnosis of left ureteric iatrogenic injury was made. You were then managed initially with urgent CT-guided nephrostomy insertion. However, you were in pain and an adequate nephrostogram was not performed during nephrostomy insertion. Patient: Yeah, I remember that. Doctor: Three weeks after the injury, you underwent a proper antegrade nephrostogram. The contrast extravasated into the peritoneal cavity, and there was no contrast passing into the distal left ureter. This led to a suspicion of complete transection of ureteric injury. Patient: Oh no! Doctor: The nephrostomy was left in situ, and you were planned for reconstructive surgery. Eleven weeks after the injury, you were admitted for your planned surgery. Patient: Yes, I remember being admitted for the surgery. Doctor: Before the surgery, a left retrograde study was performed. Surprisingly, the contrast went up to your left kidney, and there was only an annular stricture at the level of the injury. Patient: That's a relief! Doctor: Yes, so the decision was made for a ureteroscopic dilatation of the stricture. During the ureteroscopy, a small annular stricture, less than 0.5 cm, was found. It was easily passed over the safety guidewire, and a ureteric stent, size 8 French, was inserted. Patient: So everything should be okay now? Doctor: Yes, it appears the procedure was successful, and your ureteric injury has been addressed. We'll continue to monitor your progress during follow-up appointments. If you experience any new symptoms or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient reports mild pain in the left iliac fossa post-laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, managed initially with paracetamol and oral morphine. She has a history of total abdominal hysterectomy 20 years ago for endometriosis. One week post-surgery, she experienced severe left iliac fossa pain, nausea, and vomiting, prompting an emergency department visit. O: Initial postoperative period was uneventful with no flank pain or costovertebral angle tenderness. Investigations in the emergency department showed normal renal function and inflammatory markers. A contrast CT revealed extravasation at the level of the left renal pelvis and ureteric dilatation down to the pelvic ureter. An urgent CT-guided nephrostomy was inserted but the initial nephrostogram was inadequate. A subsequent antegrade nephrostogram indicated a complete transection of the left ureter. Eleven weeks later, a retrograde study showed an annular stricture at the injury level. Ureteroscopic examination confirmed a small annular stricture, and a 8 French ureteric stent was successfully placed. A: The primary diagnosis is a complete transection of the left ureter, likely iatrogenic and related to recent pelvic surgery. Differential diagnosis initially included ureteric obstruction from adhesions or residual effects of endometriosis. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic following successful ureteroscopic dilatation and stenting. P: The patient will continue with the ureteric stent in situ and undergo regular follow-up to monitor the function and position of the stent. She will be educated on signs of possible complications such as infection, stent displacement, or recurrent ureteric stricture. Pain management will continue as needed, and she is advised to report any new symptoms or concerns immediately. Further surgical intervention may be considered if complications arise or if the stricture recurs. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, could you please tell me what happened to you? How did you get injured? Patient: Oh, I was crushed by a forklift at work. It caused a lot of damage to my lower left abdomen, thigh, and knee joint. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It seems like you have a skin degloving injury, which means the skin has been torn away from the underlying tissue. The damaged area is quite extensive, about 2200 cm2. The wound is also contaminated and accompanied by circumferential multi-plane injury. You're experiencing traumatic and hemorrhagic shock. Your blood pressure is quite low at 76/39 mmHg, your pulse rate is high at 112 beats per minute, HGB is 62 g/L, albumin is 23.5 g/L, total protein is 46 g/L, HCT is 24.3%, and PT is 15.3 seconds. Patient: That sounds really bad, doctor. What do we do now? Doctor: We'll have to perform an emergent operation. During the operation, we'll debride the wound and ensure hemostasis. We'll then determine the scale of skin ischemia by puncturing and trimming the skin edge. The fringe of the ischemia lies where there's no bleeding. Any skin flap lacking blood supply will be excised. Patient: Okay, and then what happens? Doctor: We'll pull the remaining skin together with sutures to reduce the wound. After that, we'll cover the remaining wound with Vacuum Sealing Drainage (VSD). Additionally, we'll need to harvest medium-thickness skin grafts from the excised flap using a rolling knife. Patient: How will the skin grafts be used? Doctor: The skin grafts will be rolled up between two layers of gauze. We'll then stitch up the gauze with a needle and steel wire to form a cylinder. We'll reserve an appropriate length of steel wire at one end of the cylinder, so it can be easily pulled out of the liquid nitrogen tank when necessary. Patient: What happens next? Doctor: We'll immerse the cylinder in an antifreeze solution, which is composed of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide, 6% glycol propylene, and Kreb Ringer solution, for 30 minutes. After that, we'll transfer it to a liquid nitrogen tank for storage. Patient: What about after the operation? Doctor: During and after the operation, we'll carry out blood transfusion and albumin infusion to help with your recovery. We'll also administer antibiotics to prevent any infection. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and explanation. I feel more confident now. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to ensure your recovery. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask. [/INST] S: The patient reports being crushed by a forklift at work, resulting in extensive damage to the lower left abdomen, thigh, and knee joint. The patient describes the injury as involving skin degloving and expresses concern about the severity of the condition. O: Examination reveals a skin degloving injury over approximately 2200 cm2 of the lower left abdomen, thigh, and knee. The patient is in traumatic and hemorrhagic shock with vital signs showing hypotension (BP 76/39 mmHg) and tachycardia (pulse 112 bpm). Laboratory findings include severe anemia (HGB 62 g/L, normal: 135-175 g/L), hypoalbuminemia (albumin 23.5 g/L, normal: 35-50 g/L), hypoproteinemia (total protein 46 g/L, normal: 60-80 g/L), decreased hematocrit (HCT 24.3%, normal: 40-50%), and prolonged prothrombin time (PT 15.3 seconds, normal: 11-13.5 seconds). A: The primary diagnosis is a severe skin degloving injury with associated traumatic and hemorrhagic shock. Differential diagnoses could include other trauma-related complications such as deep tissue injury or infection. The prognosis depends on the success of the emergent surgical intervention and management of shock and blood loss. P: The immediate plan includes an emergent operation to debride the wound, achieve hemostasis, and assess the extent of skin ischemia. Skin flaps lacking blood supply will be excised, and the wound will be reduced and covered with Vacuum Sealing Drainage (VSD). Medium-thickness skin grafts will be harvested and prepared for cryopreservation. Post-operatively, the patient will receive blood transfusions, albumin infusions, and antibiotics to manage shock and prevent infection. Continuous monitoring and supportive care will be essential for recovery. Follow-up will include assessing graft viability and wound healing, with additional interventions as needed based on the patient's progress. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I understand you've been experiencing some pain, irritability, and difficulty with mobilization. Can you tell me more about that? Patient: Yeah, I've noticed some swelling and erythema over my little girl's interphalangeal joints. Doctor: I see. I can confirm that your daughter has polyarthritis affecting her hands and wrists. She's also been referred to a rheumatologist. Has she been displaying any other symptoms, such as a hoarse voice? Patient: Yes, she has a hoarse voice. Doctor: It appears that she has right vocal cord paresis and gastroesophageal reflux as well. She's the second child to a nonconsanguineous healthy caucasian couple, correct? Patient: That's right. Doctor: At the age of 4 months, did she develop erythematous nodules over multiple areas of her body? Patient: Yes, she did. Doctor: We suspect a diagnosis of Farber Disease (FD). Genetic testing revealed that she carries a homozygous mutation (c.458A > G [p.Tyr153Cys]) in the ASAH1 gene. We've conducted a neurological assessment and found signs of mild delay in her gross and fine motor skills, which we believe is secondary to her arthritis. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: To further assess her neurological status, we performed electroencephalography, which was unremarkable, and electromyography (EMG), which showed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or myopathy. Patient: That's a relief. Doctor: A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done prior to her transplant, and it came back unremarkable. Her initial ophthalmologic examination 4 months prior to transplant was normal. However, one cherry-red spot was identified on reassessment a few days prior to transplant. Patient: Oh, okay. Doctor: She received a myeloablative conditioning regimen with targeted IV busulfan, fludarabine, and alemtuzumab, followed by a matched (6/6) unrelated cord blood transplant at the age of 9 months. Patient: How did it go? Doctor: The transplant went well. Cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) were used as graft vs host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. She had no significant transplant-related complications and had a full recovery of all three cell lines. No signs of acute or chronic GvHD were reported. Patient: That's great to hear. Thank you for all the information, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We'll continue to monitor her progress and provide any necessary follow-up care. [/INST] S: The patient, a young girl, presented with symptoms of swelling, erythema over the interphalangeal joints, hoarse voice, and difficulty with mobilization. The mother reported that the patient had developed erythematous nodules at 4 months of age. The patient's family history is non-contributory as she is the second child to a nonconsanguineous healthy Caucasian couple. O: Physical examination confirmed polyarthritis affecting the hands and wrists, and right vocal cord paresis. Genetic testing identified a homozygous mutation (c.458A > G [p.Tyr153Cys]) in the ASAH1 gene, consistent with Farber Disease (FD). Neurological assessment indicated mild delays in gross and fine motor skills secondary to arthritis. Electroencephalography was unremarkable, and electromyography showed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or myopathy. MRI and initial ophthalmologic examination were normal, but a reassessment revealed one cherry-red spot. The patient underwent a successful unrelated cord blood transplant at 9 months with a myeloablative conditioning regimen of IV busulfan, fludarabine, and alemtuzumab. Post-transplant, cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil were used for GvHD prophylaxis, with no significant complications and full recovery of all three cell lines. A: The primary diagnosis is Farber Disease, confirmed by genetic testing and clinical presentation. The patient has complications including polyarthritis and vocal cord paresis. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic following successful transplant and absence of GvHD. P: Continue monitoring the patient's recovery post-transplant and manage any emerging symptoms of Farber Disease. Regular follow-ups with rheumatology, neurology, and genetics are recommended. Maintain GvHD prophylaxis and monitor for any signs of acute or chronic GvHD. Provide supportive care for arthritis and vocal cord paresis, including physical therapy and speech therapy as needed.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, sir. I see from your history that you're a 69-year-old man without any relevant medical history. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, doc. I've noticed a small lump in my right testis, and it's been bothering me. Doctor: Okay, let's start by doing an ultrasound examination to get a better understanding of the lump.  *After the examination* Doctor: The ultrasound revealed a solitary intra-testicular hyperechoic 12 mm tumor. The appearance is heterogeneous, and there are multiple small cystic-like areas. We also performed a color-Doppler ultrasound, which showed that the tumor is hypervascular compared to the adjacent parenchyma. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does that mean? Doctor: It means that there is an abnormal growth in your testis, and we need to do further tests to determine the nature of this tumor. We'll check your α-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and lactate dehydrogenase serum markers to see if they're within the normal range. *After the tests* Doctor: Your serum markers are normal, which is a good sign. However, we also performed a computed tomography (CT) scan and found a hypervascular parenchymal tumor in your right kidney. Patient: Oh no, what do we do now? Doctor: The best course of action is to perform a right radical nephrectomy to remove the kidney tumor, as well as a right inguinal orchiectomy to remove the testicular tumor. This will help prevent the spread of the tumor to other parts of your body. Patient: Alright, let's do it. I trust your judgment. *After the surgeries* Doctor: The surgeries were successful, and we were able to remove both tumors. We sent them for a histopathological and immunohistochemical examination to determine the nature of the tumors. Patient: What did the examination show? Doctor: The examination demonstrated that the primary tumor was a renal CCRCC that had metastasized to your testis. It was staged as pT1bN0M1, which means it was a localized tumor without any lymph node involvement and with distant metastasis to your testis. Patient: What does that mean for me moving forward? Doctor: We'll need to closely monitor your recovery and perform regular check-ups to ensure that there's no recurrence of the tumor. It's important to attend all follow-up appointments and report any new symptoms immediately. [/INST] S: The patient, a 69-year-old male with no significant past medical history, presented with a chief complaint of a palpable lump in his right testis. He expressed concern about the recent discovery of this lump. O: Physical examination and ultrasound of the testis revealed a 12 mm intra-testicular hyperechoic, heterogeneous tumor with multiple small cystic-like areas and increased vascularity. Serum tumor markers including α-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and lactate dehydrogenase were within normal limits. A CT scan identified a hypervascular parenchymal tumor in the right kidney. Post-operative findings confirmed the renal tumor as clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) with metastasis to the testis, staged as pT1bN0M1. A: The primary diagnosis is clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) with metastasis to the testis. The staging of pT1bN0M1 indicates a localized kidney tumor with distant metastasis to the testis but no lymph node involvement. The normal tumor markers suggest a favorable response to surgical intervention, although the presence of metastasis requires vigilant follow-up. P: The management plan included a right radical nephrectomy and right inguinal orchiectomy, which were successfully performed. Moving forward, the patient will undergo regular follow-up appointments to monitor for recurrence and manage any complications. It is crucial for the patient to attend all follow-up visits and report any new symptoms immediately to ensure early detection and management of potential recurrence. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see from your history that you had a mastectomy and sentinel node procedure due to breast cancer three years ago. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, doctor. Lately, I've been experiencing progressive perioral numbness and dizziness. It's been quite concerning. Doctor: I see. It sounds like you were initially suspected of having a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and you were started on carbasalate calcium 80 mg once a day as treatment. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. But despite the therapy, my symptoms kept getting worse, so I was admitted for further analysis. Doctor: I understand. Your Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) results showed that your vasculature was intact, ruling out the initial diagnosis of CVA in the vertebrobasilar region. However, there were diffuse white matter lesions around the fourth ventricle with extension into the pons and medulla oblongata. Do you remember this being discussed with you? Patient: Yeah, I remember them mentioning something about that. Doctor: A cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) sample was taken and showed pleocytosis of 240 cells/μL with 30% lymphocytes and a glucose level of 3.7 mmol/L. Blood and CSF cultures were negative. Based on these results, Herpes encephalitis with secondary vasculitis was considered, and you were started on acyclovir and dipyridamole. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's what they told me. Doctor: Unfortunately, despite this treatment, your condition deteriorated. A second CSF sample showed pleocytosis of 102 cells/μL with 96% lymphocytes and a glucose concentration of 3.2 mmol/L. At the initial presentation, your Borrelia serology was negative, but 15 days later, your Borrelia IgG became positive with a negative IgM. Can you confirm this? Patient: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: Given your recent history of a tick bite and the Borrelia sero-conversion, Lyme's disease was diagnosed. You were then started on intravenous therapy with ceftriaxone and dexamethasone. Is that right? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that your situation worsened dramatically after four days of treatment. You developed spiking fever, complete hemi-paresis, and progressing brain nerve palsy. Due to the neurologic deterioration and the diagnostic impasse, you were transferred to our academic hospital three weeks after your initial admission. Is that accurate? Patient: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: Upon presentation at our center, you were somnolent with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of E3M5V4. We will continue to investigate and provide appropriate treatment to help improve your condition. We'll also be monitoring you closely and updating you regarding your progress. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and support during this difficult time. [/INST] S: The patient, a 3-year post-mastectomy and sentinel node procedure due to breast cancer, presents with progressive perioral numbness and dizziness. Initially suspected of having a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), the patient was treated with carbasalate calcium 80 mg daily. Despite treatment, symptoms worsened, leading to hospital admission. O: MRI showed intact vasculature but diffuse white matter lesions around the fourth ventricle extending into the pons and medulla oblongata. CSF analysis revealed pleocytosis (240 cells/μL initially, 102 cells/μL on second sample) with a high percentage of lymphocytes and low glucose levels. Blood and CSF cultures were negative. Borrelia serology was initially negative, turning positive for IgG with a negative IgM after 15 days. The patient was somnolent with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of E3M5V4 upon transfer to our academic hospital. A: The primary diagnosis is Lyme disease, evidenced by symptomatology, MRI findings, CSF analysis, and positive Borrelia serology. Differential diagnoses included CVA and Herpes encephalitis, both ruled out by imaging and further testing. The patient's condition has deteriorated despite initial treatments, indicating a severe progression of Lyme disease with neurological complications. P: The patient is currently on intravenous ceftriaxone and dexamethasone. Continued monitoring of neurological status and adjustment of treatment as necessary are recommended. Further diagnostic tests to explore the extent of neurological damage are planned. Education regarding Lyme disease and its neurological impacts will be provided to the patient and family to ensure understanding and compliance with the treatment regimen. Referral to a neurologist for specialized care and a possible consultation with an infectious disease specialist are also planned. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you're here today due to hypokalaemia, malnutrition, and decreased renal function detected by your family physician. Can you tell me more about your symptoms and when they started? Patient: Yes, I had bowel resection several times about five years ago, and I've been suffering from diarrhoea for about three months. It improved on its own and I didn't have any abdominal symptoms for a while. Doctor: I understand. Please continue. Patient: Then, about a year before this admission, watery diarrhoea appeared again. I was prescribed antidiarrhoeal medication, but there was little improvement. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. I see in your past history that you had colonic perforation, abdominal wall hernia with strangulated ileus, and resection of about 2 meters 30 centimeters of the terminal ileum. Five years ago, you were diagnosed with strangulated ileus and had a small intestine resection. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: At presentation today, your blood pressure is 95/67 mmHg, heart rate is 59 beats per minute, SpO2 is 95%, and your temperature is 36.6°C. Upon physical examination, I noticed normal breath sounds and heart sounds with mild systolic murmurs. Your abdomen is flat and soft, with a negative Murphy's sign and no costovertebral angle tenderness. However, I did observe lower leg oedema. We also have your blood test results. Patient: Okay, what do the blood tests show? Doctor: Your white blood cell count is 15.30 × 103/μ with neutrophils at 78.3%, lymphocytes at 15.5%, monocytes at 5.6%, eosinophils at 0.4%, and basophils at 0.2%. Your red blood cell count is 3.34 × 106/μ, hemoglobin is 11.3 g/dL, hematocrit is 33.2%, and platelet count is 27.9 × 104/μ. Your total bilirubin is 1.6 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase is 48 IU/L, and alanine aminotransferase is 37 IU/L. Patient: Hmm, I see. What does that mean for me, doctor? Doctor: These results indicate that your body is fighting an infection, possibly due to the diarrhoea and other symptoms you've been experiencing. The oedema in your lower legs may be related to your decreased renal function. We need to address your hypokalaemia and malnutrition as well. Patient: What should I do next? Doctor: We will prescribe medications to help with the hypokalaemia and improve your renal function. Additionally, we will adjust your diet to address the malnutrition. It's important to monitor your symptoms and return for a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to ensure improvement. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to follow your instructions and come back for the follow-up appointment. [/INST] S: The patient presents with a history of multiple bowel resections, including approximately 2.3 meters of the terminal ileum due to a strangulated ileus and colonic perforation. The patient reports chronic diarrhea, which has persisted for about three months and has not significantly improved with antidiarrheal medications. The patient also mentions a history of abdominal wall hernia with strangulated ileus. O: Vital signs show a blood pressure of 95/67 mmHg, heart rate of 59 bpm, SpO2 at 95%, and temperature at 36.6°C. Physical examination reveals normal breath and heart sounds with mild systolic murmurs, a flat and soft abdomen with no signs of acute distress, and lower leg edema. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.30 × 10^3/μ, hemoglobin at 11.3 g/dL, hematocrit at 33.2%, and platelets at 27.9 × 10^4/μ. Liver function tests show total bilirubin at 1.6 mg/dL, AST at 48 IU/L, and ALT at 37 IU/L. A: The patient's clinical presentation and history suggest chronic malabsorption and malnutrition secondary to extensive bowel resection, leading to hypokalemia and decreased renal function. The chronic diarrhea, despite treatment, and the presence of leukocytosis suggest an ongoing inflammatory or infectious process. Differential diagnoses include chronic infection, inflammatory bowel disease exacerbation, or complications from previous surgeries. P: Initiate potassium supplementation and adjust the patient's diet to manage malnutrition. Prescribe medications to support renal function and possibly modify the antidiarrheal treatment to better control symptoms. Schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor the patient's response to the treatment and adjust as necessary. Educate the patient on the importance of adherence to the prescribed regimen and dietary adjustments. Consider referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation of chronic diarrhea and a nephrologist for renal function assessment if no improvement is observed. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that your 34-day-old female infant, weighing 2.3 kg, has been admitted to our institute with severe respiratory distress. Can you describe any other symptoms she has been experiencing? Parent: Yes, she has been having difficulty breathing, with a respiratory rate of 35-40/min. She sweats a lot during breastfeeding and has peripheral cyanosis. Her chest cavity also seems to indraw with each breath. Doctor: Thank you for the information. We performed a physical examination and a Chest X-ray, which revealed cardiomegaly. Then, we conducted a transthoracic echocardiography that showed a massive pericardial effusion with a space-occupying mass lesion, 5 × 4 cm in size, in the pericardial cavity on the right side. Based on her condition and the echocardiographic findings, we scheduled her for emergency tumor removal. Parent: Oh no! What can we expect during the surgery? Doctor: During the surgery, we will closely monitor her heart rate, which has been between 130-140 bpm, and her peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2). Before induction, her SpO2 was 88% and after administering 100% oxygen with a mask, it rose to 94%. Due to her age, severe respiratory distress, and cardiovascular instability, we will perform awake-sedate intubation after giving her 5 μg of fentanyl and topicalizing her tongue, larynx, and vocal cords with 15 mg of 1.0% lidocaine and a 3.0-mm Portex tracheal tube. Parent: And how will you maintain her anesthesia during the surgery? Doctor: We will maintain her general anesthesia with a mixture of oxygen/air, isoflurane, 1-mg increments of atracurium, and 5 μg of fentanyl intermittently. We will also establish an arterial line and a central venous line for monitoring. We will use other monitoring modalities such as the bispectral index (BIS), capnograph, and pulse oximetry to ensure her safety during the procedure. Extracorporeal circulation will be on standby in case of any complications. Parent: What happens during the actual tumor removal? Doctor: We will perform a median sternotomy with the preservation of the thymus gland. Upon opening the pericardium, we will aspirate a large quantity of cloudy yellow fluid. Then, we will remove the multicystic lesion, which is around 50 × 45 × 30 mm in size. It currently covers most of the right ventricle and presses on the right atrium. The mass is polycystic and attached to the right anterior wall of the heart. Our goal is to remove the mass and relieve the pressure on her heart. Parent: Thank you for explaining everything. We trust that she is in good hands and hope for a successful surgery. [/INST] S: The patient, a 34-day-old female infant weighing 2.3 kg, presented with severe respiratory distress. The parent reports difficulty in breathing, sweating during breastfeeding, peripheral cyanosis, and indrawing of the chest cavity. The respiratory rate was noted to be 35-40/min. O: Physical examination and diagnostic imaging revealed cardiomegaly on a chest X-ray. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a massive pericardial effusion and a space-occupying mass lesion measuring 5 × 4 cm in the pericardial cavity on the right side. Vital signs included a heart rate of 130-140 bpm and a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 88%, which increased to 94% after administering 100% oxygen. A: The primary diagnosis is a pericardial mass causing cardiac tamponade, evidenced by cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion, and severe respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of cardiomegaly and respiratory distress in infants, but the echocardiographic findings and symptoms strongly suggest a pericardial mass. P: The management plan includes emergency surgical removal of the tumor. Preoperative preparation involves awake-sedate intubation using 5 μg of fentanyl and 15 mg of 1.0% lidocaine. General anesthesia will be maintained with oxygen/air, isoflurane, atracurium, and intermittent fentanyl. Monitoring will include the use of BIS, capnograph, and pulse oximetry. Extracorporeal circulation will be on standby. The surgical approach will be a median sternotomy, aspiration of pericardial fluid, and removal of the multicystic lesion pressing on the right ventricle and atrium. Postoperative care will focus on recovery and monitoring for any complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see you've presented to the emergency department with swelling and redness on the right side of your neck and chest for the last three days. Can you tell me more about it? Patient: Yeah, it started suddenly and has been getting worse. It's really painful and I've been feeling really sick. Doctor: I understand. Aside from the swelling and redness, have you experienced any drowsiness or confusion? Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty out of it lately. Doctor: After assessing your condition, it seems you have symptoms of septicemia. Your Glasgow Coma Scale score is 11/15, which indicates drowsiness. Your respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, with a pulse rate of 130 beats per minute. Your blood pressure is 84/56 mmHg, and your urine output is 15 mL/hour. Do you have any history of chronic disease, drug reactions, trauma, unknown bites, or significant familial disease? Patient: No, I don't have any of those. Doctor: We've taken some blood tests, and the results show a low hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL, a raised leukocyte count of 28,000/mm3, low albumin of 2.2 g/dL, raised serum creatinine of 2.23 mg/dL, serum urea of 174 mg/dL, and low sodium of 125 mEq/L. Your erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 95 mm/hour, and your procalcitonin level is 25.2 ng/mL. These results indicate an infection. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We've also done an X-ray of your chest, which appeared normal, and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of your neck. The CECT revealed an irregular, well-defined, hypodense, non-enhancing area in your right parotid gland, with extension into the neck spaces, larynx, and subcutaneous planes. CECT of your chest revealed mild effusion in the bilateral pleural space secondary to acute infection, but no evidence of lymphadenopathy or osteomyelitis. Patient: What does all of that mean? Doctor: The findings suggest an infection that has spread to various areas. We also tested your pleural fluid with Ziehl-Neelsen staining, which was negative for acid-fast bacilli. Patient: So what's the plan now? Doctor: You'll be managed in the intensive care unit with ventilator support due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. We've diagnosed you with acute progressive necrotizing fasciitis with multiple organ dysfunction syndromes due to an unknown cause of septicemia. You'll undergo multiple aggressive debridements of your neck and chest wall to remove the infected tissue. Patient: That sounds intense, but I trust your judgment. Doctor: We'll also perform a cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test to further investigate the cause of your septicemia. We're going to do everything we can to help you get better. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [Patient eventually dies] Doctor (to patient's family): I'm very sorry to inform you that despite our best efforts, your loved one has passed away. We did everything we could to treat the acute progressive necrotizing fasciitis and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes, but the septicemia was too advanced. Our deepest condolences to you and your family during this difficult time. [/INST] S: The patient presented with a chief complaint of swelling and redness on the right side of the neck and chest, worsening over three days, accompanied by severe pain and general malaise. The patient also reported experiencing drowsiness and confusion.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been having sudden pain and swelling in my knee. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me if you have any history of knee issues or surgeries? Patient: Yes, I had a phase III Oxford UKA with a Biomet implant in 2006 for antero-medial osteoarthritis. Doctor: Okay, and how was your recovery after that surgery? Patient: It was good. I had an uneventful post-operative recovery and was completely asymptomatic. I was even discharged from the follow-up at two years with no symptoms and a range of motion of 0 to 130 degrees. Doctor: That's great to hear. Now, can you tell me more about the pain and swelling you're experiencing? Did it start after an injury or was it sudden? Patient: It was sudden. I heard a 'pop' in my knee while standing and I don't remember any obvious injury to the knee. Doctor: Alright. Let's perform a clinical examination to see what might be going on. *Examines knee* Your knee has moderate effusion and your range of motion is limited to 30 to 60 degrees. Are you able to put weight on your knee? Patient: No, I can't bear any weight on it due to the pain. Doctor: I see. I'm going to order some radiographs of your knee to further assess the situation. *After reviewing radiographs* The radiographs show a suspicion of posterior dislocation of the polyethylene insert. There's no evidence of loosening of the femoral or tibial components, which is good. We'll also check your white cell count and CRP to rule out an acute infection. Patient: Alright, and what if it's not an infection? Doctor: If it's not an infection, we'll admit you to the ward and plan for surgical exploration the following day. We may need to change the polyethylene insert or revise the components if they're loose or damaged. Patient: Okay, I understand. *After surgery* Doctor: The surgery went well. We found that both the femoral and tibial components were well fixed with no scratches, and there was no evidence of osteoarthritis in the rest of your knee. The polyethylene insert was fractured through the middle, with the anterior half sitting on the tibial component and the posterior half dislodged into the posterior compartment of the knee, stuck to the posterior capsule. Patient: Oh, I see. So, what was done to fix the issue? Doctor: We opened the knee through the previous scar of the medial para-patellar approach and replaced the fractured polyethylene insert. You should start to feel better soon, but we will monitor your recovery closely. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: Patient reports sudden onset of pain and swelling in the knee, with a history of a phase III Oxford UKA in 2006 for antero-medial osteoarthritis. Describes hearing a 'pop' sound while standing, without any recollection of injury. States inability to bear weight on the affected knee due to pain. O: Physical examination reveals moderate knee effusion and limited range of motion from 30 to 60 degrees. Radiographs indicate suspicion of posterior dislocation of the polyethylene insert, with no loosening of femoral or tibial components. Plans for laboratory tests including white cell count and CRP to exclude acute infection. A: Primary diagnosis of mechanical failure of the knee implant, specifically a fractured polyethylene insert. Differential diagnosis includes acute infection, though less likely given the imaging and clinical presentation. P: Immediate surgical intervention to explore and repair the knee. Replacement of the fractured polyethylene insert was performed successfully. Post-operative plan includes close monitoring of recovery, pain management, and physical therapy to restore function and mobility. Regular follow-up appointments to ensure proper healing and function of the knee implant. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've been referred to our clinic due to an incidental finding of a large Morgagni hernia on a recent CT chest scan for lung cancer screening. How have you been feeling lately? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been experiencing occasional shortness of breath after walking for a long time, but no chest pain. Doctor: I see. Do you have any history of acid reflux symptoms? Patient: I had acid reflux symptoms a long time ago, but nothing recently. Doctor: Good to know. Have you had any issues with prematurity or development as an infant, chest trauma, or any history of motor vehicle accidents? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those issues. Doctor: Alright. I see you've mentioned occasional right shoulder pain. Do you think it's related to your hernia? Patient: I've been attributing it to arthritis, actually. Doctor: Got it. Do you have any history of heart attack, stroke, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or pulmonary embolism (PE)? Patient: No, none of those. Doctor: And you've been a smoker for 30 pack-years but quit a year prior, right? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Great. Are you up-to-date on your colonoscopy? Patient: Yes, I had one within the past year. Doctor: Have you experienced any hematochezia, melena, bowel habit changes, or major body weight changes recently? Patient: No, I haven't noticed any of those. Doctor: Good. On examination, your vitals were within normal parameters. Heart and lungs were unremarkable, and your abdominal examination showed softness with normal bowel sounds and no tenderness. Patient: Okay, that's reassuring. Doctor: The CT chest scan demonstrated a large retroxyphoid hernia of Morgagni involving several loops of small bowel and transverse colon located in the right inferior hemithorax. Thankfully, there's no evidence of acute incarceration or strangulation. Patient: Oh, thank goodness. Doctor: We've had a detailed discussion regarding your hernia, and you've been consented for a laparoscopic repair with mesh. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, I agree to the procedure. Doctor: Great. During the surgery, you'll be in lithotomy positioning, and the primary surgeon will work between your legs. We'll use three working ports, a 12 mm port at your umbilicus, and two 5 mm ports, one in your left upper quadrant and one in your right upper quadrant. Patient: I understand. Doctor: Upon initial laparoscopy, we will reduce the multiple loops of small bowel out of the hernia sac, which also includes the ascending colon and part of the transverse colon. We'll ensure all the small bowel and colon are properly positioned. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll take good care of you during the surgery and ensure a successful recovery. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask anytime. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient reports occasional shortness of breath after prolonged walking and occasional right shoulder pain, which he attributes to arthritis. He has a history of acid reflux, which is currently asymptomatic, and a significant smoking history of 30 pack-years, though he quit one year ago. No history of heart attack, stroke, DVT, PE, prematurity, developmental issues, chest trauma, or motor vehicle accidents. No recent changes in bowel habits, hematochezia, melena, or significant weight changes. O: Vital signs within normal limits. Physical examination of heart and lungs unremarkable. Abdominal examination shows softness with normal bowel sounds and no tenderness. CT chest scan revealed a large retroxyphoid Morgagni hernia with several loops of small bowel and transverse colon in the right inferior hemithorax, without evidence of acute incarceration or strangulation. A: Primary diagnosis is a large Morgagni hernia. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath may be partially attributed to the hernia, although no acute complications like incarceration or strangulation are evident. Differential diagnosis could include other causes of dyspnea, but these seem less likely given the imaging findings and lack of cardiac or pulmonary symptoms. P: Plan to proceed with laparoscopic repair of the Morgagni hernia using mesh. The patient has been consented for surgery, which will involve reduction of the herniated bowel and colon, and placement of mesh to reinforce the hernia repair. Preoperative preparations include routine blood work and anesthesia evaluation. Postoperative care will focus on pain management, monitoring for complications, and gradual return to normal activities. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess recovery and ensure proper healing of the surgical site. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello. How have you been feeling since your recent diagnosis of cancer of the cervix? Patient: Honestly, I've been really stressed and worried about it. Doctor: I understand your concerns. As you know, you had a total hysterectomy to remove the cancer. We initially planned for you to undergo postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, I heard that you've developed urinary incontinence. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. It's been really embarrassing and frustrating. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Due to this issue, we had to cancel both the radiotherapy and chemotherapy sessions for now. To better understand your situation and check for any residual disease, we've ordered an abdominopelvic CT scan. This will also help us confirm the cause of your urinary incontinence. Patient: Okay, that sounds like a good plan. When will I be able to have the CT scan? Doctor: We'll schedule it as soon as possible. I'll let you know the exact date once we have it confirmed. Patient: Thank you. What should I expect during the CT scan? Doctor: The CT scan is a non-invasive procedure. You'll lie down on a table that slides in and out of a large, circular machine. It will take multiple images of your abdomen and pelvis to give us a detailed view of the area. The entire process should take about 30 minutes. Patient: Alright. And when can I expect to get the results? Doctor: We should have the results within a few days. Once we have them, we'll discuss the findings and determine the best course of action for your treatment. Patient: I appreciate your help. I'm really hoping the CT scan will provide some answers. Doctor: I understand. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of your urinary incontinence issue and ensure you receive the necessary treatment. In the meantime, please let me know if you have any other symptoms or concerns. Patient: Will do. Thank you for your support, doctor. I'll wait for the CT scan appointment and hope for the best. Doctor: You're welcome. We're here to help you through this difficult time. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before the CT scan. Take care. [/INST] S: The patient, recently diagnosed with cervical cancer, reports significant stress and worry about her condition. She underwent a total hysterectomy as initial treatment. Postoperatively, she developed urinary incontinence, which she describes as embarrassing and frustrating. This complication has led to the cancellation of planned radiotherapy and chemotherapy. O: The patient's recent surgical history includes a total hysterectomy for cervical cancer. Due to the development of urinary incontinence post-surgery, further treatment plans involving radiotherapy and chemotherapy were postponed. An abdominopelvic CT scan has been ordered to assess for residual disease and investigate the cause of the urinary incontinence. The procedure is described as non-invasive, with a duration of approximately 30 minutes. A: Primary diagnosis is cervical cancer, post-total hysterectomy, with a complication of urinary incontinence. The assessment is focused on determining the cause of the incontinence and checking for any residual cancerous tissue. The differential diagnosis may include complications from surgery such as damage to the urinary tract. P: The immediate plan includes conducting an abdominopelvic CT scan to evaluate the extent of the problem and any residual disease. The patient will be informed of the CT scan date as soon as it is scheduled. Results are expected within a few days of the scan, after which a detailed discussion of the findings and subsequent treatment options will occur. The patient is advised to report any new symptoms or concerns in the interim. Further management will depend on the CT scan results, with considerations for resuming cancer treatment and addressing urinary incontinence. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, welcome to our clinic. How can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I arrived in Switzerland in 2015 as a refugee from Eritrea. I am married and have three children who are in good health. I had a routine appointment with my primary care physician and mentioned a soft and slightly painful swelling in my right buttock, localized on a previous scar. Doctor: I see. Tell me more about the scar and your past medical history. Patient: In 2001, when I was in Eritrea, I had surgery several times for a recurrent abscess on my right buttock. I haven't had any other health issues, don't smoke or drink, and don't take any regular treatments. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Let's do a physical examination to assess the swelling and scar. *After examining* I can see a 20 cm scar on the lateral side of your right buttock and some deep indurated exophytic nodules with visible openings and spontaneous drainage, which suggests an abscess (Fig.). You appear afebrile and I can't find any lymphadenopathy. Patient: What should I do next? Doctor: I'll refer you to the Department of Dermatology at the University Hospital of Lausanne for further investigation. They'll likely perform a punch biopsy to get a better understanding of the issue. Patient: Okay, thank you. *At the Department of Dermatology* Doctor: We'll now conduct the punch biopsy. During the procedure, we witnessed a sanguinolent discharge with conglomerates of small and rather firm blackish pellets, evoking eumycetoma. We'll send tissue and black grain samples for biological and histological evaluation. *After receiving the evaluation results* Doctor: The evaluation results show chronic suppurative inflammation with the presence of histologic fungal aspects (Figs. and ). The exact infectious agent couldn't be determined at that time, but the black colored grains indicate a probable Madurella mycetomatis infection. We'll need to perform a second biopsy to confirm this. Patient: Alright, let's do the second biopsy. *After the second biopsy* Doctor: The second biopsy results are negative for bacterial culture and positive for fungal culture of Madurella mycetomatis, which grew in 2 weeks. This confirms the infection. Patient: What's the next step? Doctor: We'll determine the precise depth and extent of the infection in order to develop an appropriate treatment plan. We'll keep you updated and discuss further steps once we have more information. Patient: Thank you for your help, doctor.

The patient is afebrile with no lymphadenopathy detected. A punch biopsy performed showed sanguinolent discharge with blackish pellets, indicative of eumycetoma. Histological evaluation confirmed chronic suppurative inflammation with fungal aspects, and a second biopsy confirmed Madurella mycetomatis infection. A: The primary diagnosis is a fungal infection by Madurella mycetomatis, evidenced by chronic suppurative inflammation and confirmed by fungal culture. Differential diagnosis initially included other causes of chronic abscesses but was narrowed down following biopsy results. P: The patient will be referred for further imaging to assess the depth and extent of the infection. A treatment plan will be developed based on the imaging results, likely involving antifungal therapy. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the treatment response and adjust the plan as necessary. Education on the nature of the infection and the importance of adherence to the treatment plan will be provided. </s>"

I was diagnosed with hypokalemic periodic paralysis in 2005 and hyperthyroidism in 2008. I've been taking antithyroid drugs irregularly since then. Doctor: Have you undergone any proper biochemical examination during this time? Patient: No, I haven't. When I feel the weakness is getting severe, I usually self-prescribe potassium chloride. Doctor: I see. Can you describe your symptoms leading up to your most recent hospital visit? Patient: In June 2017, my lower limb weakness increased so much that I couldn't walk. I took potassium chloride, but there was no improvement. So, I was admitted to another hospital. Doctor: What were your vital signs and muscle strength at the time? Patient: My temperature was 36.7 °C, and my pulse was 96 beats/min. My lower limb muscle strength was grade II, and my upper limb strength was grade III. My limb muscle tone was normal. Doctor: Okay, and what were your electrolyte and blood marker levels at that time? Patient: My K+ was 1.4 mmol/l, Na+ was 138 mmol/l, Cl− was 97 mmol/l, and Ca2+ was 2.61 mmol/l. My FT3 was 6.96 pmol/l, FT4 was 38.96 mIU/l, TSH was < 0.01 mIU/l, TgAb was 16.61 IU/ml, and TRAb was 22.36 mIU/l. Doctor: Did they perform a thyroid ultrasound during your stay? Patient: Yes, the ultrasound demonstrated diffuse thyromegaly with a rich blood supply. Doctor: Based on your diagnosis of Graves' disease and hypokalemic periodic paralysis, you were treated with propylthiouracil (PTU) and potassium chloride, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Were there any complications or new symptoms during your treatment? Patient: After 2 days, my weakness improved, but my temperature increased to 41 °C, and I experienced cough and expectoration. Doctor: Did they perform any imaging tests to determine the cause of your fever and cough? Patient: Yes, they did a computed tomography (CT) imaging of my lungs, and it revealed pneumonia. Doctor: I understand. It's important to continue monitoring your symptoms and follow up with your healthcare provider to ensure proper treatment and management of your conditions. [/INST] S: The patient reports a 12-year history of paroxysmal limb weakness and was diagnosed with hypokalemic periodic paralysis in 2005 and hyperthyroidism in 2008.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've been admitted due to unilateral proptosis in your left eye that has been developing for about six months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, I've had this bulging in my left eye for a while now. It's been quite uncomfortable. Doctor: I understand. Your medical history shows that you have suffered from HT for the past 2 years and have been treated with levothyroxine 25 μg daily. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: You also mentioned that you don't have any other significant comorbidities, have never smoked, and your personal and family history is negative for thyroid disorders. Is that accurate? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: We've run some tests, and your laboratory results indicate euthyroidism. Your TSH level is 2.67 μU/ml, which is within the reference range of 0.27–4.20 μU/ml. Your free T3 and free T4 concentrations are also within the normal ranges, at 4.97 pmol/l and 13.58 pmol/l, respectively. Patient: Oh, okay. Doctor: Your thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) concentration is normal as well at 0.9 IU/l. However, your anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) serum levels and anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb) are significantly elevated, at 279 IU/ml and 194 IU/ml, respectively. Patient: Hmm, what does that mean? Doctor: It suggests that there may be an autoimmune issue. Additionally, your 25-OH vitamin D serum level is 25 ng/ml, which indicates mild vitamin D deficiency. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We also performed an ultrasound examination, which demonstrated features suggesting chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Your thyroid gland showed heterogeneous decreased echogenicity, no focal lesions, and normal size and vascularity. Patient: So what's causing the problem with my eye? Doctor: In the neutral position, your left eyeball is positioned convergently and downwards, which implies extraocular muscle involvement. You also presented with conjunctival erythema, eyelid redness and edema, and an enlarged, swollen lacrimal caruncle. Von Graefe's, Stellwag's, Kocher's, and Moebius' signs were positive in your left eye, whereas the Rosenbach's sign was negative. Patient: Oh, I didn't realize all those signs were connected. Doctor: Yes, these signs and symptoms, along with your lab results, suggest that your eye condition may be related to your thyroid issue. We will continue to monitor your progress and discuss the best course of treatment for both your eye and thyroid. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll keep you updated and work together to help you feel better. [/INST] S: Patient reports unilateral proptosis in the left eye developing over six months, described as uncomfortable. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine 25 μg daily for the past 2 years. No other significant comorbidities, non-smoker, negative personal and family history for thyroid disorders. O: Vital signs stable. Lab results show euthyroid status with TSH at 2.67 μU/ml (normal range 0.27–4.20 μU/ml), free T3 at 4.97 pmol/l, and free T4 at 13.58 pmol/l. Elevated anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) at 279 IU/ml and anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb) at 194 IU/ml. Mild vitamin D deficiency with 25-OH vitamin D at 25 ng/ml. Ultrasound of thyroid indicates chronic autoimmune thyroiditis with heterogeneous decreased echogenicity. Examination of the left eye shows convergent and downward positioning, conjunctival erythema, eyelid redness and edema, enlarged lacrimal caruncle, and positive Von Graefe's, Stellwag's, Kocher's, and Moebius' signs. A: Primary diagnosis of thyroid eye disease (TED) associated with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Differential diagnosis includes other causes of orbital inflammation but less likely given the autoimmune markers and thyroid function tests. P: Continue monitoring thyroid function and eye condition. Increase levothyroxine dose to optimize thyroid function and potentially reduce autoimmune activity. Start selenium supplementation for eye disease and vitamin D supplementation to correct deficiency. Refer to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and management of TED.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having trouble with my vision since I was a child. I've had nyctalopia and my vision has been getting worse recently. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about the changes in your vision? Patient: Sure. My visual acuity and visual fields have been decreasing since my twenties. Doctor: Alright, let's start with an examination. We'll check your visual acuity first.  *After the visual acuity test* Doctor: Your visual acuity is 20/400 in your right eye and 20/63 in your left eye. Have you ever had an ERG examination before? Patient: I tried, but I couldn't tolerate the examination. Doctor: No worries, we can do a Funduscopy instead to check for any abnormalities in your eyes. *After the Funduscopy* Doctor: The Funduscopy revealed bone spicule pigmentation and attenuated retinal vessels, which are characteristic for Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). We'll also perform Fundus AF and OCT imaging to get a better understanding of your condition. *After Fundus AF and OCT imaging* Doctor: The Fundus AF showed areas of increased and decreased Autofluorescence (AF) in your right eye and a fine pattern of radial lines radiating from the fovea in your left eye. The OCT imaging revealed widespread thinning of the photoreceptor layer in both eyes, with foveal sparing in the left eye. Additionally, there was thickening of the inner retina mainly around the optic disc, more obvious in the right eye than the left eye. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does it mean? Doctor: Based on these findings, we identified a mutation in your RPGR gene, which is associated with RP. This might be the cause of your vision problems. Do any of your parents have a history of retinal disease? Patient: No, neither of them has any history of retinal disease. Doctor: We should perform a genetic analysis on your mother to check if she's a carrier of the X-linked RP mutation. *After genetic analysis of the mother* Doctor: The genetic analysis showed that your mother has wild-type RPGR alleles, meaning she's not a carrier of the X-linked RP mutation. This indicates a de novo RPGR mutation in you, which is a new mutation that was not inherited from your parents. Patient: I see. What should I do now? Doctor: Unfortunately, there's no cure for RP, but we'll closely monitor your condition and provide you with the necessary support to manage your symptoms. I'll also refer you to a low vision specialist who can help you adapt to your decreasing vision. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, who has had nyctalopia since childhood, reports a progressive decline in visual acuity and visual fields starting in their twenties. The patient has a history of difficulty tolerating an ERG examination. O: Visual acuity testing revealed 20/400 in the right eye and 20/63 in the left eye. Funduscopy showed bone spicule pigmentation and attenuated retinal vessels, indicative of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). Fundus Autofluorescence (AF) displayed areas of increased and decreased AF in the right eye and a pattern of radial lines from the fovea in the left eye. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging indicated widespread thinning of the photoreceptor layer in both eyes, with foveal sparing in the left eye and thickening of the inner retina around the optic disc, more pronounced in the right eye. Genetic testing identified a de novo mutation in the RPGR gene, not inherited from the patient's mother who has wild-type RPGR alleles. A: The primary diagnosis is Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) due to a de novo mutation in the RPGR gene. Differential diagnoses were considered but the genetic findings and clinical presentation confirm RP. The prognosis includes progressive vision loss with no current cure available. P: The management plan includes regular monitoring of the patient's vision and referral to a low vision specialist to help adapt to decreasing vision. Genetic counseling will be provided to discuss the implications of the de novo mutation. Patient education will focus on understanding RP, its progression, and coping strategies. No specific medication or dietary changes are indicated at this time. Compliance with follow-up appointments and adaptation aids will be emphasized to manage symptoms effectively. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you were admitted to the hospital two weeks ago for influenza B pneumonia. How have you been feeling since then? Patient: Well, I started experiencing hematuria, epistaxis, and a subcutaneous hemorrhage in the area of my right shoulder. Doctor: I see. Let's take a look at your laboratory results. It appears that you have anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL. Your APTT is prolonged at 73.1 seconds, with the control being 27.6 seconds. You also have microscopic hematuria with more than 100 red blood cells per high power field. Based on these findings, we diagnosed you with Acquired Hemophilia A (AHA). Patient: Oh my, how did you come to that conclusion? Doctor: We found that your Factor VIII (FVIII) activity level is less than 1.0%, and your anti-FVIII inhibitor level is 8.8 Bethesda Units per milliliter. This confirms the diagnosis of AHA. Patient: What's the plan to treat this condition? Doctor: After consultation with a hematologist, we decided to administer six doses of recombinant activated Factor VII (rFVIIa), which is also known as NovoSeven®, at a dosage of 90 micrograms per kilogram per dose. This treatment will be given over two days in combination with prednisolone, starting at 0.6 milligrams per kilogram per day and then tapered. Patient: How long will it take for my symptoms to improve? Doctor: Within five days, we expect your hematuria and subcutaneous hemorrhages to improve. AHA should be controlled within two weeks, and a complete remission can be achieved. Patient: That's good to hear. Is there anything I should be mindful of during this treatment? Doctor: Just make sure to follow the prescribed dosage for the prednisolone and report any worsening of your symptoms or any new symptoms. We will closely monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing hematuria, epistaxis, and a subcutaneous hemorrhage in the area of the right shoulder following hospitalization for influenza B pneumonia two weeks ago. O: Laboratory findings indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL (normal: 13.8-17.2 g/dL for men, 12.1-15.1 g/dL for women). The patient's APTT is prolonged at 73.1 seconds (control: 27.6 seconds), and microscopic hematuria is present with more than 100 red blood cells per high power field. Factor VIII activity level is less than 1.0% (normal: 50%-150%), and anti-FVIII inhibitor level is 8.8 Bethesda Units per milliliter, confirming Acquired Hemophilia A (AHA). A: The primary diagnosis is Acquired Hemophilia A, evidenced by severe reduction in Factor VIII activity and presence of anti-FVIII inhibitors. Differential diagnoses could include other coagulopathies, but these are less likely given the specific findings related to Factor VIII. P: Treatment plan includes administration of six doses of recombinant activated Factor VII (NovoSeven®) at 90 micrograms per kilogram per dose over two days, in combination with prednisolone starting at 0.6 milligrams per kilogram per day, then tapered. Expected improvement in hematuria and subcutaneous hemorrhages within five days, with potential control of AHA within two weeks. Patient is advised to adhere strictly to the prednisolone dosage and report any new or worsening symptoms. Close monitoring of the patient's progress and adjustment of the treatment plan will be conducted as necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been having pain and stiffness in my right elbow for the last 2 years. I'm a manual laborer and it's been affecting my work. Doctor: I see. When do you feel the pain is worse? Patient: The pain gets worse after periods of rest and when I wake up in the morning. But I don't have any pain during the night. Doctor: Have you tried any medications to relieve the pain? Patient: Yes, I've tried salicylates and some other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, but they only provide partial relief. Doctor: Alright. Have you had any other musculoskeletal complaints or any significant past medical history? Patient: No, this is my only issue. I've consulted other doctors before and they've mentioned diagnoses like lateral epicondylitis and mono-articular rheumatoid involvement. Doctor: Let's do a physical examination. *examines elbow* There's no swelling or fullness around your elbow, but there's mild tenderness along the anterior aspect. Your elbow range of motion is restricted from 30 to 90°, but supination and pronation are normal. We'll need to do some imaging tests to better understand what's going on. *after conducting radiographs and CT scan* Doctor: According to the plain radiographs and computed tomography with 3D reconstruction, there's a 4 mm radio-dense ring in the coronoid fossa of your humerus, with a 2 mm radiolucent nidus and a thin bony shell in the anterior aspect of the lesion. These findings are consistent with a sub-periosteal osteoid osteoma. Patient: Oh, I see. What are the treatment options for this condition? Doctor: In your case, we'll proceed with arthroscopic excision. We'll perform elbow arthroscopy under general anesthesia in lateral decubitus position. Patient: What will you do during the procedure? Doctor: During the arthroscopy, we'll use a 2.7-mm, 30° arthroscope to visualize the lesion in the coronoid fossa. It will appear as a hyperaemic bony protuberance covered with hypertrophied synovium. We'll shave the synovium with an arthroscopic shaver and remove the thin cortical shell over the lesion. Once the nidus is exposed, it will be easily shelled out upon manipulation. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining the procedure. When can we schedule the surgery? Doctor: We can schedule the surgery as soon as possible. After the procedure, you'll need some time to recover, but you should be able to return to your normal activities within a few weeks. Patient: That sounds good. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to help you get back to your regular life without pain. If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've come to the National Institute of Integrative Medicine Clinic in Melbourne in June 2016. How can I help you today? Patient: Hi, my daughter has been experiencing chronic pain, extreme muscle wasting which requires a wheelchair, growth retardation, and she's severely underweight at 20 kg. She also has swollen and painful joints, heart palpitations, loose stools, and headaches. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It seems like her condition is causing extreme weakness, not allowing her to move her limbs without assistance. So, she's not able to feed herself, move her legs, or even stand up, right? Patient: Yes, that's correct. She's been so ill that she hasn't been able to attend school for several months now, and she's been in and out of the hospital regularly. Doctor: I see that she was diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) three years ago and has been treated with standard medications for the potential autoimmune condition. This includes regular corticosteroid infusions with methylprednisolone, treatment with methotrexate, and anakinra, which is a recombinant and modified interleukin-one-receptor-antagonist. Patient: Yes, but despite these treatments, her condition has worsened over the past three years. By the time we came here, her prognosis was extremely critical. Doctor: I understand. It looks like her illness started suddenly three years ago with a high fever and rashes. This coincided with the illness and sudden death of her pet dog, which had been experiencing a wobbly walk, weight loss, and listlessness before its accidental death with an open wound and blood loss. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. She was exposed to the dog's blood in her eyes when it passed away. We're worried it might be a possible infection from the dog. Doctor: That's a plausible path of infection. Our research lab here at NIIM has developed a two-part Pathogen Blood Test assay that combines cytological microscopy and genetic analysis of the pathogen by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) DNA analysis. We can use this test to help identify any possible infection in your daughter. Patient: Oh, that sounds promising. What do we need to do for this test? Doctor: We'll need to take a fresh blood sample from your daughter and process it for the test. The results will help us determine if there is an infection and guide us towards the best treatment options. Patient: Okay, thank you. We're hopeful this test will provide some answers and help improve her condition. Doctor: You're welcome. Let's proceed with the blood test, and we'll discuss the results and next steps once we have them. We're here to help your daughter get better. [/INST] S: The patient, a young girl, presents with chronic pain, extreme muscle wasting requiring wheelchair use, growth retardation, severe underweight status at 20 kg, swollen and painful joints, heart palpitations, loose stools, and headaches. She has been unable to attend school for several months due to her illness and has been hospitalized frequently. She was diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) three years ago, which coincided with the sudden onset of symptoms following exposure to her pet dog's blood. Despite treatment with methylprednisolone, methotrexate, and anakinra, her condition has deteriorated. O: The patient is experiencing extreme weakness, unable to move limbs without assistance, feed herself, or stand. She has been treated with regular corticosteroid infusions, methotrexate, and anakinra. A new test, the Pathogen Blood Test assay, which includes cytological microscopy and PCR DNA analysis, is planned to identify any potential infections. A: Primary diagnosis is severe, progressive juvenile idiopathic arthritis complicated by potential zoonotic infection from her deceased pet. Differential diagnoses could include other autoimmune disorders or infectious diseases contributing to her symptoms. The prognosis is currently critical, pending further diagnostic results. P: Proceed with the Pathogen Blood Test to identify any underlying infections. Continue supportive care for JIA and symptoms management. Review treatment efficacy for JIA and consider adjustments based on test results and clinical response. Educate the family about the importance of compliance with the treatment plan and prepare them for possible changes based on diagnostic findings.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been having some progressive pain in my left knee for about 3 months now, but it hasn't really limited my daily activities. Doctor: I see. We'll need to do an initial assessment to understand the cause of your pain. Let's start with a radiographic investigation. (After the investigation) Doctor: We found a large radiolucent area in your left proximal tibia, caused by osteolytic deconstruction. We'll need to perform some more tests to get a precise diagnosis, including a computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging, Tomosynthesis-Shimadzu metal artefact reduction technology (T-SMART), a bone scan, and a biopsy. Patient: Okay, I understand. (After the tests) Doctor: Your lesion has been diagnosed as a Campanacci Grade II Giant Cell Tumor (GCT) with no pulmonary metastasis. Fortunately, we didn't detect any fractures in your subchondral bone on the CT scan. Patient: That's a relief. What's the next step? Doctor: Before planning surgery, we need to evaluate your pain at rest, knee joint function, percentage of affected area of the subchondral bone, and the thickness of the residual subchondral bone layer. The pain at rest will be evaluated on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst pain imaginable. We'll also record the range of your knee joint motion. Patient: Okay, sounds good. (After evaluation) Doctor: Based on our evaluation, we've determined that the thickness of your residual pre-operative subchondral bone layer is quite poor. We'll need to perform implantation using a 3D-printed scaffold structure and a supplemental bone graft to prevent further damage to the subchondral bone that could be caused by friction between the cement and subchondral bone during cement packing, and to avoid the formation of a non-biological, rigid graft-cement interface that could occur after cement packing combined with bone grafting. Patient: I see. When can we schedule the surgery? Doctor: We'll need to get approval for this study, and then we can schedule the surgery. In the meantime, try to manage your pain and maintain your daily activities as best as you can. Patient: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient reports progressive pain in the left knee over the past 3 months, which has not significantly limited daily activities. O: Radiographic investigation revealed a large radiolucent area in the left proximal tibia due to osteolytic deconstruction. Further diagnostic tests, including CT scan, MRI, T-SMART, bone scan, and biopsy, diagnosed a Campanacci Grade II Giant Cell Tumor (GCT) with no pulmonary metastasis. No fractures were detected in the subchondral bone on the CT scan. Evaluation of pain at rest using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and knee joint function assessment were conducted. The thickness of the residual pre-operative subchondral bone layer was found to be poor. A: The primary diagnosis is Campanacci Grade II Giant Cell Tumor (GCT) of the left proximal tibia. The patient's condition involves significant osteolytic deconstruction but no pulmonary metastasis or fractures in the subchondral bone. The poor thickness of the residual subchondral bone layer poses a risk for further damage. P: The management plan includes surgical intervention with implantation using a 3D-printed scaffold structure and a supplemental bone graft to prevent damage to the subchondral bone and avoid a non-biological, rigid graft-cement interface. Surgery scheduling is pending approval for the study. The patient is advised to manage pain and maintain daily activities in the interim. Further evaluations and follow-ups will be scheduled post-surgery to monitor recovery and function. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, I'm Dr. Smith. I understand you were referred to our hospital after a colonoscopy revealed a large rectosigmoid mass causing near total rectal occlusion. Can you tell me about your past medical history? Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with NSCLC, stage IIIB adenocarcinomatous type, about a year ago. I've had radiation and immunotherapy with pembrolizumab and thought to be in remission. Doctor: I see. On admission, you mentioned worsening right upper quadrant abdominal pain and constipation. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, it's been getting worse over time. Doctor: Okay. Your vital signs, physical examination, and laboratory testing were primarily benign, which is good. We performed a CT imaging, and it showed a severe colonic stool burden, a single left upper lobe lung mass consistent with your NSCLC history, and a large soft tissue mass with mucosal invasion in the rectosigmoid colon. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Due to the situation, you underwent an urgent colostomy, ileocecectomy, anastomosis, and rectosigmoid mass resection with tissue sampling. The histopathology results favored poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It means the tumor is more aggressive. The H&E staining showed extensive necrosis, focal mucosal involvement, and negativity for regional lymph node carcinoma. We performed controlled immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, which revealed strong positive immunoreactivity for CK7 and positive TTF-1 Napsin-A, Moc-31, and Ber-EP4. Minimal focal staining for p63, CK5, and CK6 was observed. Patient: Okay, so what does all of that mean for me? Doctor: The tumor tissue was negative for CDX2, CK20, CD45, MART-1, GCDFP-15, ER, synaptophysin, NCAM/CD56, and chromogranin. Mucicarmine staining was equivocal for intracytoplasmic mucin. Based on the IHC staining profile, it supports metastatic adenocarcinoma of lung origin, rather than primary colorectal adenocarcinoma. Patient: So, it's spread from my lungs to my colon? Doctor: Yes, that appears to be the case. However, your postoperative course was uneventful, and you were discharged after the operation. We will need to closely monitor your condition and determine the best course of action for your treatment. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, previously diagnosed with stage IIIB NSCLC (adenocarcinomatous type), reported worsening right upper quadrant abdominal pain and constipation. He was thought to be in remission following radiation and immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. He was referred to the hospital after a colonoscopy revealed a large rectosigmoid mass causing near total rectal occlusion. O: Vital signs and physical examination were primarily benign. CT imaging showed severe colonic stool burden, a single left upper lobe lung mass consistent with NSCLC, and a large soft tissue mass with mucosal invasion in the rectosigmoid colon. Post-surgical histopathology of the rectosigmoid mass indicated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with extensive necrosis and focal mucosal involvement.

A: The primary diagnosis is metastatic NSCLC with secondary involvement of the rectosigmoid colon. Differential diagnosis initially included primary colorectal adenocarcinoma, but immunohistochemical profiles supported lung origin. The prognosis is guarded due to the aggressive nature of the poorly differentiated tumor and its metastatic spread. P: The patient underwent urgent colostomy, ileocecectomy, anastomosis, and rectosigmoid mass resection. Postoperative management includes close monitoring and follow-up consultations with oncology for potential additional chemotherapy or targeted therapy based on the metastatic nature of the disease.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I have a palpable mass in my left inguinal region that I noticed a month ago. I didn't have this in my infancy or adolescence. Doctor: I see. Do you have any history of trauma or operations in that area? Patient: No, I don't have any history of trauma or operations there. But I had a cyst aspiration about 2 months ago. Doctor: Alright. Let me perform a physical examination to assess the mass. *After examination* I observed a soft-consistency, mobile mass of about 4 cm in size in your left inguinal region. During the Valsalva maneuver, the mass did not change in size and shape. We will need to perform some tests to get a better understanding of the mass.  Patient: Okay, what kind of tests do I need? Doctor: First, let's check your laboratory findings. We'll do a complete blood count, urinalysis, and blood biochemistry tests. *After receiving the results* Your results are within the normal range. Next, we'll perform an Ultrasonography. *After the Ultrasonography* It revealed a hypoechoic cystic mass with a size of 40x50 mm in your left inguinal area without any vascular flow and no peristalsis. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: The results suggest that we should proceed with an abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the communication between the cystic mass and the peritoneal cavity, and to better understand the precise anatomy around the cystic mass. *After the MRI* The MRI showed that the cystic mass in the inguinal canal included thin septa, and hydrocele of the canal of Nuck was suspected because of the low and high signal intensities observed on the T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively. Only the wall and septa were contrast-enhanced. Patient: So what's the next step? Doctor: We will perform an exploration surgery to remove the cystic lesion. We'll make an incision in the left inguinal region, and suspend the round ligament by passing through the anatomical folds. *After the surgery* The defect was repaired with prolene mesh after high ligation. Patient: How did it go? What did you find? Doctor: The histopathologic examination evaluated the mass as a simple cystic structure with cubic epithelium. You will be discharged on the 1st postoperative day. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us. We will also need to follow up with you to ensure your recovery is going smoothly. Take care! [/INST] S: The patient, a male, presented with a chief complaint of a palpable mass in the left inguinal region, first noticed a month ago. He denied any history of trauma or operations in that area but mentioned undergoing a cyst aspiration two months prior. He reported no changes in the mass during the Valsalva maneuver. O: Physical examination revealed a soft, mobile mass approximately 4 cm in size in the left inguinal region, unchanged by the Valsalva maneuver. Laboratory tests including complete blood count, urinalysis, and blood biochemistry were within normal limits. Ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic cystic mass measuring 40x50 mm in the left inguinal area, with no vascular flow or peristalsis. MRI indicated a cystic mass in the inguinal canal with thin septa, suspected hydrocele of the canal of Nuck, showing low and high signal intensities on T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively, with only the wall and septa contrast-enhanced. Histopathologic examination post-surgery confirmed the mass as a simple cystic structure with cubic epithelium. A: The primary diagnosis is hydrocele of the canal of Nuck. The differential diagnosis initially included possible inguinal hernia or other cystic inguinal masses, but imaging and surgical findings confirmed the diagnosis. P: The patient underwent exploratory surgery with excision of the cystic lesion and repair of the defect using prolene mesh after high ligation of the round ligament.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello there, what brings you to the surgical outpatient department today? Patient: Hi, I've been having this perineal swelling for quite some time now. I noticed it about 6 months ago, and it's in the right perineal region. Doctor: I see. Can you describe the swelling for me? How large is it? Patient: It's about the size of a lemon. It hasn't really increased in size over the past months. Doctor: Okay, and is the swelling painful? Have you noticed any changes in the overlying skin colour or texture? Patient: No, it's painless and there haven't been any changes in the skin colour or texture. Doctor: Alright. Based on your complaints, I think we should refer you for an MRI examination to check for a possible lipoma in the soft tissues.  Patient: Okay, sure. (After the MRI) Doctor: I have the results of your MRI here. We carried out the examination before and after administration of intravenous gadolinium contrast. The MRI revealed a well-encapsulated lesion measuring 36 × 26 × 24 mm in the subcutaneous soft tissues of the perineum on the right side. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: The lesion appears as a low signal intensity on T1 weighted images, intermediate signal intensity on T2 weighted images and heterogeneous high signal intensity on proton density fat-saturated images. The lesion showed restricted diffusion with low signal intensity on apparent diffusion coefficient images and high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images. Post-contrast images demonstrated subtle enhancement of the lesion wall, with no abnormal internal enhancement. Patient: So, is it a lipoma? Doctor: Based on the MRI features, we can rule out the clinical diagnosis of a lipoma. Instead, we suggest that it is an epidermoid cyst. Patient: What's the next step then? Doctor: We will perform surgical excision of the swelling. After that, the specimen will be sent for histopathology to confirm the diagnosis. Patient: Alright. I hope it's not something serious. (After surgery and histopathology) Doctor: Good news! The histopathology report confirmed that the swelling is indeed an epidermoid cyst, and there is no evidence of malignancy. Patient: Oh, that's a relief! Thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, presenting in the surgical outpatient department, reports a history of perineal swelling first noticed approximately 6 months ago.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see we have an 11-month-old male infant who was admitted with a high-grade fever and symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection. Can you tell me more about the symptoms? Mother: Yes, he has been having trouble breathing and coughing a lot. Doctor: I see. We performed a chest radiograph, which showed normal lung fields but an abnormal cardiac silhouette with a prominent bulge along the left cardiac border. This led us to perform a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) for further evaluation. Mother: What did the TTE show? Doctor: The TTE revealed a large left paracardiac blood-filled sac with sluggish flow. However, the sac occupied most of the field of view, making it difficult to assess the extent of the lesion and its relationship to the left atrium. So, we decided to perform a cardiac MRI (CMR) to better understand the lesion, its extent, and effects on cardiac function. Mother: How was the CMR done? Doctor: We performed a non-contrast CMR on a 3 T scanner. The infant was given oral sedation with chloral hydrate syrup. After administration, he was allowed to sleep in your arms, wrapped in his own blanket to help maintain sedation for the 30-minute scan. Mother: That's good. He seemed to be comfortable and slept throughout the process. Doctor: Yes, we find that it's comforting for the child to be examined while wrapped in familiar fabric. It helps them sedate more easily and maintains the sedation for the duration of the study. Mother: So, what did you find out from the CMR? Doctor: We obtained axial three-dimensional (3D) whole-heart images using a respiratory-gated spoiled gradient sequence and cine images in standard cardiac planes. These images provided us with volumetric data that we reconstructed in various planes to define the location, morphology, and extent of the lesion. Mother: And what about the ventricular function and blood flow within the lesion? Doctor: We used free-breathing steady-state free-precession sequences to evaluate the ventricular function and blood flow within the lesion. The CMR depicted a 7-cm large lesion. Mother: Oh, I see. What's the next step now? Doctor: We will discuss the findings with a team of specialists to determine the best course of action for your child. We will keep you informed and involve you in the decision-making process. Mother: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help and support throughout this process. [/INST] S: The patient, an 11-month-old male infant, presented with a high-grade fever and symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection, including difficulty breathing and frequent coughing as reported by his mother. O: Physical examination and initial tests included a chest radiograph showing normal lung fields but an abnormal cardiac silhouette with a prominent bulge along the left cardiac border. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a large left paracardiac blood-filled sac with sluggish flow. Cardiac MRI (CMR) performed with oral sedation using chloral hydrate syrup showed a 7-cm lesion, with volumetric data reconstructed to define the location, morphology, and extent of the lesion. Ventricular function and blood flow within the lesion were assessed using free-breathing steady-state free-precession sequences. A: The primary diagnosis is a large left paracardiac lesion, likely a vascular anomaly given its characteristics and location. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of cardiac or paracardiac masses. The prognosis depends on the specific nature of the lesion and its impact on cardiac function. P: The management plan includes a multidisciplinary team discussion to determine the optimal intervention strategy. The patient's mother will be kept informed and involved in the decision-making process. Further consultations with pediatric cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery may be necessary depending on the team's recommendations. Continuous monitoring of cardiac function and symptoms is essential, with follow-up appointments scheduled to assess progress and treatment efficacy. </s>"

Let's do an examination to see what's going on. *Examines patient* Your knees seem to have a full range of motion. We should get an X-ray to get a better look at them. Patient: Okay, that sounds good. *After X-ray* Doctor: The X-ray results show that you have severe bilateral tricompartmental osteoarthritis. This is likely the cause of your pain and decreased walking distance. Patient: Oh no, that's not good. What can we do about it? Doctor: Since conservative treatment has failed, I recommend a bilateral total knee replacement procedure. We'll use the PS Sigma implants for your surgery. Patient: Alright, let's do it. *After Surgery* Doctor: The surgery went well, but there was a unique implant error. The right femoral implant was placed in the left knee instead of the left femoral component. However, the postoperative radiographs show well-fixed femoral, tibial, and patellar components. Patient: Oh, is that going to be a problem? Doctor: Surprisingly, the postoperative examination shows painless full range of motion from 0 to 125 degrees. There's no patellar maltracking and no popping sounds. I'll inform you about this error and we'll monitor your progress closely. Patient: Okay, I appreciate the honesty. *5 years later* Patient: It's been 5 years since the surgery, and I just have some mild occasional pain, but otherwise, I'm functioning well.

Your Knee Society score is 75 and your Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) is 84, which indicates good progress despite the implant error. Patient: Thank you, Doctor, for helping me through this process. [/INST] S: The patient reports severe pain in both knees, significantly impacting walking ability. The patient has a history of failed conservative treatment for knee issues. O: Physical examination revealed full range of motion in both knees. X-ray confirmed severe bilateral tricompartmental osteoarthritis. Postoperative radiographs showed well-fixed femoral, tibial, and patellar components despite an implant error with the right femoral implant placed in the left knee. Postoperative examination showed painless full range of motion from 0 to 125 degrees, no patellar maltracking, and no popping sounds. Five years post-surgery, the patient reports only mild occasional pain. Knee Society score is 75, and WOMAC score is 84. A: The primary diagnosis is severe bilateral tricompartmental osteoarthritis. The patient underwent bilateral total knee replacement with PS Sigma implants, complicated by an implant placement error. Despite this, the patient has shown good functional recovery and minimal symptoms five years postoperatively. P: Continue regular follow-up to monitor knee function and address any potential complications from the implant error. Encourage the patient to maintain a healthy weight and engage in low-impact exercises to support joint health. Provide pain management options as needed for occasional mild pain. Educate the patient on signs of potential complications requiring immediate consultation. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see from your history that you're a 37-year-old female with epilepsy secondary to astrocytoma. You had the astrocytoma surgically resected and underwent radiation and chemotherapy a year prior to this presentation. Can you tell me about the types of seizures you've been experiencing? Patient: Yeah, I've been having focal seizures and sometimes generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Doctor: I also noticed that you're on a few different AEDs, including levetiracetam, valproic acid, and zonisamide. Have these been helping control your seizures? Patient: They seemed to be working, but I found out I was pregnant ten days ago and decided to stop taking the valproic acid, just in case. Since then, I've had a significant increase in my seizure frequency. Doctor: I understand your concern for your pregnancy. Due to the increased frequency of seizures, we admitted you to our neurocritical care unit. We increased your home doses of LEV and ZNS from 1500 mg bid to 2000 mg bid and from 200 mg bid to 300 mg bid, respectively. Your blood levels of LEV and ZNS on admission were 23 ug/mL and 29 mcg/mL, which are within therapeutic ranges. Patient: That's good to know. Is there anything else I should be doing for my pregnancy? Doctor: On day 2 of your hospitalization, we started you on daily prenatal vitamins in addition to 4 mg of folic acid. A transvaginal ultrasound showed a single intrauterine pregnancy corresponding with a 6-week, 6-day gestation by crown rump length. Patient: Oh, I see. But I'm still having intermittent seizures involving both sides of my face and feeling confused. Doctor: Yes, we noticed that as well. We placed you on continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, which showed right hemisphere focal SE. Your seizures continued at a rate of multiple episodes per hour, and you didn't respond to a total of 10 mg of lorazepam administered in 2 mg doses. Therefore, we decided to intubate and start anesthetic agents. Patient: What kind of anesthetic agents are you using? Doctor: We started a continuous propofol infusion without a bolus dose at a rate of 30 mcg/kg/min and titrated it to 45 mcg/kg/min. However, further up titrations were not tolerated because of dose-related hypotension. You also received a bolus of 80 mg ketamine intravenously and were started on a continuous ketamine infusion. Patient: I hope these treatments help control my seizures. Thanks, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to closely monitor your condition and adjust treatments as needed to ensure the best outcome for both you and your baby. [/INST] S: The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of epilepsy secondary to astrocytoma, which was surgically resected followed by radiation and chemotherapy a year ago. She reports experiencing focal seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. She stopped taking valproic acid due to pregnancy, leading to an increase in seizure frequency. She is currently pregnant, approximately 7 weeks gestation, and expresses concerns about her increased seizure activity and its management during pregnancy. O: The patient's home doses of levetiracetam and zonisamide were increased from 1500 mg bid to 2000 mg bid and from 200 mg bid to 300 mg bid, respectively. Blood levels of levetiracetam and zonisamide on admission were 23 ug/mL and 29 mcg/mL, within therapeutic ranges. Continuous EEG monitoring showed right hemisphere focal status epilepticus (SE). Despite 10 mg of lorazepam, seizures persisted, leading to intubation and initiation of anesthetic agents. A transvaginal ultrasound confirmed a single intrauterine pregnancy at 6 weeks and 6 days gestation. A: Primary diagnosis is epilepsy with increased seizure frequency, likely exacerbated by discontinuation of valproic acid and physiological changes due to pregnancy. Differential diagnosis includes potential complications from ongoing seizures and medication effects on pregnancy. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic with close monitoring and adjustment of therapeutic strategies. P: Continue levetiracetam and zonisamide at adjusted doses. Monitor therapeutic drug levels and adjust as necessary. Maintain propofol infusion at 30-45 mcg/kg/min and continue ketamine infusion, monitoring for side effects like hypotension. Administer prenatal vitamins and 4 mg of folic acid daily. Regular fetal monitoring and obstetric consultation are recommended. Educate the patient on the importance of seizure control during pregnancy and the potential risks and benefits of her current medication regimen. Adjust treatment plans based on seizure activity and pregnancy progression. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I understand you were recently admitted to the Emergency Room in an unconscious state. Can you tell me what happened before you lost consciousness? Patient: Hi, Dr. Smith. Yeah, I remember being stung by a wasp just before I passed out. Doctor: I see. When you were brought in, you had signs of hemodynamic impairment. Your ECG showed ST-T depression in the inferior and anterolateral leads. Your blood levels of cardiac biomarkers were also elevated. You have some cardiovascular risk factors like dyslipidemia and smoking, and you suffered a stroke in 2017. We treated you with steroids and epinephrine initially. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it was. Your blood pressure fell to a low level of 65/45 mmHg, so we put you on norepinephrine until your systolic blood pressure reached 95 mmHg. Your ECG then showed ST-T elevation in the anterior leads. Your blood tests showed a Troponin level of 17.6 ng/mL, myoglobin at 1341 ng/mL, Ck-MB at 92 ng/mL, and a WBC count of 22,650 cells/uL. Your eosinophils and basophils were normal, though. Patient: What did all those numbers mean, Doc? Doctor: Those numbers indicated that you had a heart problem. We performed a coronary arteriography, which showed a subocclusion of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. Patient: So, what was the treatment for that? Doctor: We performed an emergency primary PTCA and placed drug-eluting stents in the proximal and middle segment of your anterior interventricular artery. This led to the resolution of the subocclusion. Patient: I'm glad that was taken care of. Doctor: Yes, your echocardiogram on the third day showed normal cavity geometries and wall thickness of the left ventricle, good global kinetic, and an EF of 55%. Your blood levels of troponin and Ck-MB were also reduced. You were discharged from the hospital with prescriptions for ASA 100 mg/day, ticagrelor 90 mg 2 bid, bisoprolol 1.25 mg/day, atorvastatin 80 mg/die, and ramipril 2.5 mg/day. You were also referred to your general practitioner. Patient: What about the wasp sting? Doctor: A careful medical history revealed that the wasp sting triggered your unconscious state. Following the diagnosis of hymenoptera allergy, confirmed by a positive skin prick test and specific IgE to wasp, we started you on a desensitizing therapy. Patient: Oh, I see. What should I do moving forward? Doctor: You should continue with the medications prescribed and attend regular follow-up appointments with your general practitioner to monitor your heart health. Also, make sure to carry an epinephrine auto-injector with you in case of future wasp stings, and avoid exposure to wasps as much as possible. Patient: Alright, thank you, Dr. Smith. I'll make sure to follow your recommendations. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. [/INST] S: The patient reports being stung by a wasp just before losing consciousness. He has a history of dyslipidemia, smoking, and a stroke in 2017. O: Upon admission, the patient was unconscious with hemodynamic impairment. Initial vital signs showed a blood pressure of 65/45 mmHg. ECG indicated ST-T depression in the inferior and anterolateral leads, progressing to ST-T elevation in the anterior leads. Lab results revealed elevated cardiac biomarkers: Troponin 17.6 ng/mL (normal <0.04 ng/mL), myoglobin 1341 ng/mL (normal 28-72 ng/mL), Ck-MB 92 ng/mL (normal 0-3.6 ng/mL), and a WBC count of 22,650 cells/uL (normal 4500-11,000 cells/uL). Coronary arteriography showed a subocclusion of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. Post-treatment echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function with an EF of 55%. A: The patient experienced a myocardial infarction triggered by a wasp sting, leading to anaphylactic shock and acute coronary syndrome. Differential diagnoses included other causes of acute chest pain and unconsciousness, but these were ruled out by the findings. P: Emergency treatment included steroids, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, followed by primary PTCA with placement of drug-eluting stents. Prescribed medications upon discharge were ASA 100 mg/day, ticagrelor 90 mg 2 bid, bisoprolol 1.25 mg/day, atorvastatin 80 mg/die, and ramipril 2.5 mg/day. The patient was also started on desensitizing therapy for hymenoptera allergy and advised to carry an epinephrine auto-injector. Follow-up with the general practitioner is recommended for ongoing monitoring of heart health and allergy management. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've presented to our clinic with restricted movement in your left elbow. How long has this been going on? Patient: Hi, doctor. It has been bothering me for about 9 months now. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me if there was any history of trauma to your elbow? Patient: Yes, I had an injury around the time it started, and I was treated by a local bonesetter. Doctor: Okay, let's do a physical examination to assess the situation. *After examining* Your elbow is stiff in 40 degrees of flexion. I noticed a disruption in the three-point bony relationship between the olecranon tip and medial and lateral epicondyles, with the olecranon tip being prominent posteriorly and tenting of the triceps tendon. I didn't observe any neurologic deficit, which is good. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We'll need to do some further tests to have a better understanding of your condition. *After performing X-rays and CT scan* The X-rays show a posterior elbow dislocation with a displaced radial head fracture. The CT scan demonstrated the irreparable radial head fracture with an indented articular surface and deformation of the fracture ends. I also noted a tip fracture of the coronoid process (Reagan-Morrey type I). Patient: So, what's the next step, doctor? Doctor: The best course of action would be surgical treatment with open reduction of the elbow and radial head replacement. In this case, we'll use a custom-made anatomical radial head prosthesis instead of a commercial one due to limited availability in our country. Patient: How will you create the custom prosthesis? Doctor: We'll perform a high-resolution CT scanning of both your elbows using a Philips Brilliance 64 CT scanner. The images will be reconstructed into 3D images, and the affected side will be aligned with the mirrored image of the contralateral bone to identify the correct anatomic profile. Then, we'll use computer-aided design (CAD) to construct a 3D prosthesis model. Patient: That sounds advanced. What's the purpose of this technique? Doctor: This technique allows us to have accurate preoperative planning for the position of additional bone resection and extent of radial neck restoration. It also helps us design the stem configuration of the prosthesis. Patient: Alright, doctor. I trust your judgment and hope this will help me regain my elbow function. Doctor: Thank you for trusting us with your care. We'll do our best to ensure a successful treatment and recovery. We'll schedule the surgery and keep you informed about the next steps. [/INST] S: The patient reports restricted movement in the left elbow, persisting for approximately 9 months, initiated after an injury treated by a local bonesetter. No history of previous similar symptoms or other joint issues was mentioned. O: Physical examination revealed left elbow stiffness at 40 degrees of flexion, disrupted three-point bony relationship, prominent posterior olecranon tip, and tenting of the triceps tendon without neurologic deficits. X-rays indicated a posterior elbow dislocation with a displaced radial head fracture. CT scan showed an irreparable radial head fracture with indented articular surface, deformation of fracture ends, and a tip fracture of the coronoid process (Reagan-Morrey type I). A: The primary diagnosis is a posterior elbow dislocation with associated irreparable radial head fracture and coronoid process fracture. Differential diagnoses could include chronic post-traumatic osteoarthritis or unresolved joint subluxation. The prognosis depends on surgical outcomes and rehabilitation adherence. P: Plan to proceed with surgical treatment involving open reduction of the elbow and radial head replacement using a custom-made anatomical radial head prosthesis. Preoperative planning will include high-resolution CT scanning of both elbows, 3D reconstruction, and CAD for prosthesis design. Post-surgery, the patient will require physical therapy for rehabilitation and regular follow-up to monitor recovery and function restoration. Education on post-surgical care and potential complications will be provided to ensure compliance and optimal recovery. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, what brings you to the emergency department today? Patient: Hi, I've been feeling really tired and dizzy for the past 3 days. I also noticed that my stools have been dark and I've been having some mild abdominal pain. Doctor: I see. Do you have any history of hematemesis, hematochezia, or bleeding from any other site? Patient: No, I don't have any history like that. Doctor: Have you had any similar episodes before, or any history of liver disease or use of NSAIDs? Patient: No, nothing like that. Doctor: I understand you're taking rivaroxaban 20 mg/day. Can you tell me more about your past medical history? Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with extensive portomesenteric thrombosis 2 years ago. They found that I have a heterozygous mutation of factor V Leiden. My protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III levels were normal. I also tested negative for autoimmune conditions, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV serology. Doctor: Do you have any family history of venous thromboembolism or other bleeding disorders? Patient: No, there's no family history of such conditions. Doctor: Okay, let's perform a clinical examination. *After the examination* You seem to be hemodynamically stable and not in distress. I noticed marked pallor during the physical examination. Let's do a digital rectal examination. *After the rectal examination* Your stool is green, but there's no evidence of melena at this time. Doctor: We've received your laboratory test results. Your hemoglobin level is 7.5 g/dl, platelet count is 210,000/ul, INR is 1.1, urea is 6.6 mmol/l, creatinine is 90 umol/l, and your liver function tests are normal. Based on these findings, we will admit you as a case of probable GI bleeding. Patient: Oh, okay. Doctor: We will stop your rivaroxaban for now and give you a transfusion of packed red blood cells to help with your symptomatic anemia. Patient: Alright, thank you. Doctor: We performed an urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and it showed a normal esophagus and stomach. However, there was a suspicious area distal to the 3rd part of the duodenum that we couldn't reach with the normal EGD scope. We had to do a push enteroscopy, which revealed multiple varices in the proximal jejunum with red wale signs and submucosal feeding veins. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We also did a CT abdomen with contrast, and it demonstrated total occlusion. We will discuss your case with the team and determine the best course of action. Please follow our instructions for further care and let us know if you experience any changes in your symptoms. Patient: Okay, I will. Thank you for your help, Doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, a 34-year-old male, presents with a 3-day history of fatigue, dizziness, dark stools, and mild abdominal pain. He denies any history of hematemesis, hematochezia, or bleeding from other sites. He has no prior episodes of similar symptoms or history of liver disease but is currently on rivaroxaban 20 mg/day due to a diagnosis of extensive portomesenteric thrombosis 2 years ago, associated with a heterozygous mutation of factor V Leiden. He denies any family history of venous thromboembolism or bleeding disorders. O: Physical examination shows the patient to be hemodynamically stable with marked pallor. Digital rectal examination revealed green stools without evidence of melena. Laboratory tests show hemoglobin at 7.5 g/dl (normal: 13.8-17.2 g/dl), platelet count at 210,000/ul (normal: 150,000-450,000/ul), INR at 1.1, urea at 6.6 mmol/l, creatinine at 90 umol/l, and normal liver function tests. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and push enteroscopy identified multiple varices in the proximal jejunum with red wale signs and submucosal feeding veins. CT abdomen with contrast showed total occlusion. A: The primary diagnosis is gastrointestinal bleeding likely secondary to jejunal varices, in the context of extensive portomesenteric thrombosis and rivaroxaban use. Differential diagnoses could include other sources of GI bleeding, but current findings support the primary diagnosis. The patient's prognosis depends on the management of the varices and the underlying thrombosis. P: The immediate plan includes discontinuation of rivaroxaban and administration of a transfusion of packed red blood cells to address symptomatic anemia. Further management will involve discussing the case in a multidisciplinary team to determine the best approach for treating the jejunal varices and the total occlusion observed on CT. The patient will be monitored closely for changes in symptoms and hemodynamic status, and will be educated on the signs of worsening bleeding and when to seek immediate medical attention. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to reassess his condition and adjust treatment plans as necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I had squamous cell cancer of the lower lip back in 2013. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about the treatment you received for that? Patient: I had a complete resection, including plastic reconstruction of the lip and vermillionectomy, as well as submental lymph node resection on both sides. Doctor: What did the histology report show after the surgery? Patient: It demonstrated that there was infiltration of a moderately differentiated squamous cell cancer, with muscle invasion. But the margins were negative, and there were no signs of metastases. Doctor: So, the initial tumor stage was pT1, pN0, which means no adjuvant therapy was needed. Now, have you experienced any symptoms since then? Patient: In May 2015, I had a swelling in my right cheek. The biopsy confirmed a relapse with submandibular lymph node metastases on the right side. Doctor: What treatment did you receive for that relapse? Patient: I had a neck dissection, level I-V on the right side, and level I-III on the left side. Then I had radiotherapy, 63 Gy on the right side, and 54 Gy on the left side. Doctor: How did you tolerate the therapy? Were there any symptoms? Patient: The therapy was well-tolerated, and I didn't have any relevant clinical symptoms. Doctor: Great. What happened during your routine follow-up in December 2015? Patient: A local relapse with new lymph node manifestations on the right side was confirmed. A whole body CT-scan showed no signs of metastases. Doctor: It must have been difficult to hear that. What was the treatment plan for the new tumor manifestation? Patient: The doctors said a complete resection was infeasible, so I started systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin, 5-FU and cetuximab. Doctor: How did the tumor respond to the chemotherapy? Patient: After four cycles, a neck MRI-scan revealed progressive disease. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Did they perform any further testing on the lymph node metastases from May 2015? Patient: Yes, immunohistochemical staining showed that 25% of the tumor cells were positive for PD-L1, while the PD-1 expression was negative. Doctor: Based on those findings, did they change your therapy? Patient: Yes, they started me on nivolumab therapy in April 2016, with 3 mg/kg every 2nd week. Doctor: How has your tumor responded to the nivolumab treatment? Patient: After 6 administrations, restaging with CT and MRI showed no change in the tumor extension, so it's considered stable disease. Doctor: It's good to hear that your disease is now stable. Please continue to follow up with your oncologist to monitor your condition, and let us know if you experience any new symptoms or changes in your health. [/INST] S: The patient, previously diagnosed with squamous cell cancer of the lower lip in 2013, treated with complete resection and lymph node resection, reports a history of recurrent disease. In 2015, he experienced swelling in the right cheek, confirmed as a relapse with submandibular lymph node metastases. He underwent further surgery and radiotherapy. In December 2015, another local relapse was identified. Systemic chemotherapy was initiated but showed progressive disease after four cycles. The patient is currently on nivolumab therapy, with the disease considered stable. O: Initial treatment included surgery and lymph node resection with negative margins and no metastases. Recurrence treated with neck dissection and radiotherapy (63 Gy right, 54 Gy left). Recent treatments include chemotherapy (cisplatin, 5-FU, cetuximab) and immunotherapy (nivolumab 3 mg/kg biweekly). Immunohistochemical staining showed 25% PD-L1 positivity. Current imaging shows stable disease. A: The primary diagnosis is recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip with submandibular lymph node metastases. Differential diagnoses could include other head and neck cancers, but clinical history and biopsy confirm recurrence. The prognosis is guarded given the recurrent nature and progression despite multiple lines of therapy. P: Continue nivolumab therapy as per current regimen and closely monitor the disease's response through regular CT and MRI scans. Maintain follow-up appointments with the oncology team every 2 weeks to assess treatment efficacy and manage any emerging side effects. Consider potential enrollment in clinical trials for advanced therapies given the progressive nature of the disease. Educate the patient on signs of disease progression or complications to ensure timely reporting and management. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see you've been referred to our clinic due to swelling, warmth, and red discoloration in your little girl's right lower extremity. Can you tell me more about her symptoms and any relevant medical history? Parent: Yes, she has had growth retardation and protein-energy malnutrition. Doctor: I see. We conducted a color Doppler ultrasound examination and found generalized thrombus within her great and small saphenous veins, popliteal vein, superficial and deep femoral veins, and common femoral vein. We also performed an intraabdominal venous color Doppler ultrasound, which showed that her bilateral common iliac veins and infrarenal and renal segments of the IVC were thrombosed. However, her suprarenal and intrahepatic segments of IVC were preserved. Parent: Oh no, that sounds serious. Is there any family history of deep venous thrombosis or IVC agenesis? Doctor: Based on the information provided, there is no family history of deep venous thrombosis or IVC agenesis in her parents or her two elder brothers. Parent: I see. What about genetic testing? Did you find anything? Doctor: Yes, we conducted a detailed genetic testing and it revealed that your daughter has Down syndrome, with one extra twenty-first chromosome, and a pericentric inversion in the ninth chromosome. Her karyotype is 47, XX, inv (9p11q13), +21. Parent: Oh, I didn't expect that. What about her risk for venous thrombosis? Doctor: We did a cardiovascular risk analysis panel and found that she has an increased venous thrombosis risk with homozygous MTHFR (A 1298C) polymorphism, HPA 1 (b/b), factor V Leiden (G1691A) heterozygous, and ACE I/D genotype (Del/Del). The other panel polymorphisms were normal.  Parent: What about those other factors you mentioned, like factor XIII, Prothrombin, Fibrinogen, and APO B? Doctor: Her MTHFR C677T polymorphism was C677C, factor XIII V34L polymorphism was V34LL, PAI-Serpine1 mutation 4G/5G test was 5G/5G, Prothrombin G20210A was 20210GG, Beta Fibrinogen 455A > G polymorphism was 455G > G, and APO B R3500Q polymorphism was 3500RR. Parent: Wow, that's a lot of information. Do I have any genetic abnormalities? Doctor: We tested your karyotype as well, and it showed 46, XX, inv (9p11q13), which represents the normal female.  Parent: Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. What are the next steps for my daughter's care? Doctor: We will develop a personalized treatment plan for your daughter, focusing on managing her symptoms and preventing any complications. We will also closely monitor her growth and development, as well as any cardiovascular risks. Regular follow-up appointments will be necessary to ensure her well-being. [/INST] S: The patient, a young girl, presented with swelling, warmth, and red discoloration in her right lower extremity. Her parent reports a history of growth retardation and protein-energy malnutrition. There is no family history of deep venous thrombosis or IVC agenesis. O: Color Doppler ultrasound examination revealed generalized thrombus in the great and small saphenous veins, popliteal vein, superficial and deep femoral veins, and common femoral vein of the right lower extremity. Additional thrombosis was noted in bilateral common iliac veins and infrarenal and renal segments of the IVC, while suprarenal and intrahepatic segments of the IVC were preserved. Genetic testing indicated Down syndrome with a karyotype of 47, XX, inv (9p11q13), +21. Cardiovascular risk analysis showed increased venous thrombosis risk with homozygous MTHFR (A 1298C) polymorphism, HPA 1 (b/b), factor V Leiden (G1691A) heterozygous, and ACE I/D genotype (Del/Del). Other genetic factors such as factor XIII, Prothrombin, Fibrinogen, and APO B were also assessed and reported. A: The primary diagnosis is extensive deep venous thrombosis in the context of genetic predispositions including Down syndrome and multiple thrombophilia-associated polymorphisms. Differential diagnoses would consider other causes of limb swelling but are less likely given the imaging and genetic findings. P: The management plan will focus on anticoagulation therapy to manage and prevent further thrombosis, nutritional support to address protein-energy malnutrition, and regular monitoring of growth and development. Genetic counseling will be provided to the family to discuss the implications of the genetic findings. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. Referrals to pediatric hematology and genetics are recommended for specialized care and further evaluation. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you're an 81-year-old man with a history of left total hip replacement, open discectomy at the L4/5 level more than 10 years prior, percutaneous coronary intervention 3 years prior, and periodontitis detected 1 month before presentation. Can you tell me more about your current symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've been suffering from severe back pain for the last 2 days. Doctor: I see. We did some plain lumbar spine radiographs which showed spondylosis but no signs of fractures. Additionally, your laboratory tests were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.2 × 104 cells/μl and C-reactive protein level of 13.8 mg/dl. Based on these findings, we admitted you for treatment. Patient: Okay, so what happened after I was admitted? Doctor: Two days after admission, we performed magnetic resonance imaging of your lumbar spine and discovered discitis at the L5/S level. To further investigate, we did punctures of the disc from both the left and right side under fluoroscopy and obtained two samples. We also collected two sets of blood cultures and urine cultures at the same time. Patient: And what was the result of those tests? Doctor: We started you on empiric therapy with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours and ceftriaxone 1 g every 24 hours combined with lumbosacral orthosis. After 6 days, the culture of the disc aspirate came back positive. The causative agent was identified as G. morbillorum based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis. Patient: Were my blood and urine cultures positive too? Doctor: No, both your blood and urine cultures were negative. A transthoracic echocardiogram was also performed, and it showed no evidence of endocarditis. Patient: So, what's the next step for my treatment? Doctor: We couldn't perform the broth microdilution method for susceptibility testing because the isolate did not grow in the wells. Instead, we used the E-test method for determining susceptibility to penicillin G. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the isolate for penicillin G was 0.012 μg/ml, which was interpreted as susceptible. Patient: Okay, so what does that mean for me? Doctor: It means that your infection is susceptible to penicillin G, and we can adjust your treatment accordingly. We will continue to monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to keep you informed and work towards your recovery. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. [/INST] S: The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of left total hip replacement, open discectomy at L4/5, percutaneous coronary intervention, and periodontitis. He presents with severe back pain that started 2 days ago. O: Physical examination and recent medical interventions include plain lumbar spine radiographs showing spondylosis without fractures, and MRI revealing discitis at L5/S1. Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count of 1.2 × 10^4 cells/μl and a C-reactive protein level of 13.8 mg/dl. Disc and blood cultures were performed; disc culture was positive for G. morbillorum, while blood and urine cultures were negative. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed no signs of endocarditis. Susceptibility testing indicated that the G. morbillorum isolate is susceptible to penicillin G with an MIC of 0.012 μg/ml. A: The primary diagnosis is discitis at L5/S1 caused by G. morbillorum. Differential diagnoses initially included other sources of infection or inflammation, but these were ruled out by imaging and negative blood and urine cultures. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the susceptibility of the organism to penicillin G. P: Continue empiric therapy with vancomycin and ceftriaxone while transitioning to penicillin G based on susceptibility results. Maintain lumbosacral orthosis for spinal support. Monitor clinical and laboratory parameters closely to assess response to treatment. Educate the patient on the importance of adhering to the treatment regimen and schedule follow-up appointments to monitor progress and make necessary adjustments to the therapy. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. How can I help you today? Patient: Good morning, doctor. I've been having this vague pain in my abdomen for about a month now. It's mostly in the right lower part. I've also been feeling weak, nauseous, and have had a decreased appetite for the past 6 months. Doctor: I see. Have you had any surgeries in the past? Patient: No, I haven't. Doctor: Alright, let me examine your abdomen. *palpates the patient's abdomen* It seems there is some mild tenderness in your right iliac fossa. And, you don't have a fever. We'll need to run some laboratory tests and perform an abdominal ultrasonography to get a better understanding of your condition. *After running tests and ultrasonography* Doctor: Your laboratory results show Leucocytosis with neutrophilia, which indicates an infection. The abdominal ultrasonography revealed an encapsulated cystic lesion in the lower quadrant of your abdomen with liquid content of variable echogenicity. It could be an Appendicular Abscess or a Mucocele of the Appendix. We need to perform an abdominal CECT to confirm the diagnosis. *After the abdominal CECT* Doctor: The CECT results show a well-circumscribed low attenuating tubular mass contiguous with the base of the caecum. It has thin curvy linear mural calcifications with few low attenuating areas along the surface of the lesion. This confirms it as a Mucocele of the Appendix. Patient: Oh, I see. What's the next step, doctor? Doctor: We will need to perform a Vertical Midline Incision Laparotomy to remove the cystic mass. During the surgery, we will examine the mass and surrounding lymph nodes for any signs of malignancy. *After the surgery* Doctor: The surgery went well. Intraoperatively, we found a cystic mass of the appendix measuring 8 cm × 5 cm with broad base and inflamed walls. It was communicating with the caecum, but there was no perforation. We also found multiple significant lymph nodes in the mesoappendix and ileocolic region. Due to the suspicion of malignancy and the unavailability of a frozen section, we performed an extended right hemicolectomy with ileotransverse anastomosis. Patient: What's the final diagnosis, doctor? Doctor: The histopathological report confirms it as a Mucinous Cystadenoma with Mucocele. You will need to come in for regular check-ups to ensure your recovery is on track. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to follow up. Doctor: You're welcome. It's been 6 months since the surgery and I'm glad to see you're doing well with no postoperative complications. If you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. [/INST] S: The patient, a female, reports experiencing vague pain in the right lower abdomen for about a month, accompanied by weakness, nausea, and decreased appetite persisting for six months. She denies any past surgical history. O: Physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the right iliac fossa without fever. Laboratory tests indicated Leucocytosis with neutrophilia. Abdominal ultrasonography showed an encapsulated cystic lesion in the lower quadrant with variable echogenicity. Abdominal CECT confirmed a well-circumscribed low attenuating tubular mass contiguous with the base of the caecum, featuring thin curvy linear mural calcifications. Intraoperative findings included an 8 cm × 5 cm cystic mass of the appendix with inflamed walls, communicating with the caecum, and multiple significant lymph nodes in the mesoappendix and ileocolic region. Histopathology confirmed Mucinous Cystadenoma with Mucocele. A: The primary diagnosis is Mucinous Cystadenoma with Mucocele of the Appendix. Differential diagnosis initially included Appendicular Abscess. The prognosis is generally favorable post-surgery, but requires regular monitoring for any signs of malignancy or recurrence. P: The patient underwent a Vertical Midline Incision Laparotomy followed by an extended right hemicolectomy with ileotransverse anastomosis due to the suspicion of malignancy. Postoperative management includes regular follow-ups to monitor recovery and detect any complications early. The patient is advised to report any new symptoms or concerns immediately. Regular check-ups are scheduled to ensure ongoing recovery and to manage any potential long-term complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've been referred to our university hospital due to progressive psychomotor decline over the past year. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've been experiencing a lot of issues recently. I have trouble walking, it's like a spastic-ataxic gait, and I also have spastic hemiparesis. I've noticed I have apraxia, hand tremors, and my eye movements are really saccadic. My speech has also been affected, and I have a speech production disorder. My tendon reflexes are quite brisk, too. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. We've conducted a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your brain, and it revealed symmetric atrophy, particularly in the frontal lobes and periventricular, along with white matter lesions. We've initiated a neurological examination based on this information (Figure a). The complex clinical presentation you described correlates with the brain MRI alterations. Patient: Oh, I see. So, what's the next step? Doctor: We've referred you to our genetic department for further differential diagnostics of a suspected inherited microangiopathy. At age 44, we didn't detect any dysmorphological features that would suggest a recognizable syndrome. However, we performed a pedigree analysis over three generations, which revealed several affected relatives with neurological disorders. This indicates an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance (Figure ). Patient: Yeah, my mother had a cerebral infarction and passed away at 45, after experiencing rapid neurological decline with aphasia and paralysis. My maternal aunt died after several years of being tentatively diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Two maternal uncles were also thought to have cerebral infarctions, and one of them is already deceased. My maternal grandmother died due to renal insufficiency and polyneuropathy associated with diabetes mellitus. Doctor: Thank you for providing that family history. We considered various differential diagnoses, including CADASIL (cerebral arteriopathy, autosomal dominant, with subcortical infarcts, and leukoencephalopathy), Fabry disease, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, and frontotemporal dementia. We used the OMIM database search and the program Phenomizer to find the best congruence with your clinical synopsis. Patient: And what did you find? Doctor: Based on our analysis, your symptoms best align with hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS). So, we initiated targeted gene analysis of CSF1R, which has allowed us to confirm the diagnosis of HDLS in your case. Patient: I see. What does that mean for me, and what should I do now? Doctor: HDLS is a rare neurological disorder that affects the brain's white matter. While there is currently no cure for HDLS, we'll work closely with you to manage your symptoms and discuss any available treatment options. We'll monitor your condition and provide support as needed. It's important for you to stay closely connected with your healthcare team and keep us informed of any changes in your symptoms. Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. I appreciate all your help in figuring this out. [/INST] S: The patient, a 44-year-old, reports progressive psychomotor decline over the past year, including difficulty walking with a spastic-ataxic gait, spastic hemiparesis, apraxia, hand tremors, saccadic eye movements, and a speech production disorder. The patient also notes brisk tendon reflexes. There is a significant family history of neurological disorders, including cerebral infarctions and Parkinson's disease-like symptoms in close relatives. O: Neurological examination confirmed the patient's reported symptoms. MRI of the brain showed symmetric atrophy in the frontal lobes and periventricular areas, along with white matter lesions. Genetic testing was conducted, focusing on the CSF1R gene, which confirmed the diagnosis of hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS). A: The primary diagnosis is HDLS, a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive white matter degeneration. Differential diagnoses considered included CADASIL, Fabry disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and frontotemporal dementia. The patient's clinical presentation and family history, along with genetic testing, supported the diagnosis of HDLS. P: The management plan includes symptomatic treatment and regular monitoring of the patient's neurological status. There is no cure for HDLS, but efforts will be focused on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. The patient will be closely followed by the neurology team, and genetic counseling will be provided to the patient and family members. The patient is advised to maintain regular follow-up appointments and report any new symptoms or changes in condition. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I understand you were admitted to the Department of Neurology here at the IRCCS Policlinico San Donato. Can you tell me about your symptoms? Patient: Hi, doctor. Yeah, I've been having muscular stiffness and grip myotonia since I was 12. I've also had difficulties in fine finger movements and diffuse muscle stiffness, especially when I wake up in the morning. Doctor: I see. Have these symptoms changed over time? Patient: Yes, they've worsened over time and with cold, but they improve with repetitive movement. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We conducted a neurological examination to assess your muscle strength and tone. The results showed normal muscle strength (grade 5 MRC in all muscles tested) and tone. We also noticed a lid lag, eyelid and mild tongue myotonia. Severe grip myotonia was evident, with a positive warm-up phenomenon. Your deep tendon reflexes were normal. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: We also performed an EMG, which showed diffuse signs of myotonic discharges in all muscles tested. Your EKG, Holter electrocardiographic recordings, and echocardiogram were all normal. Patient: That's good to hear. Doctor: Yes, it is. Now, we also conducted laboratory studies to check your electrolyte, urea, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. All of these were normal. However, your CPK was 231 U/L (normal values < 190 U/L), and your AST (56 U/L; normal values < 41 U/L) and GGT (106 U/L; normal values 8–61 U/L) were mildly increased. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: Your lipid profile showed high levels of total cholesterol (260 mg/dl; normal values < 200 mg/dl), LDL cholesterol (174 mg/dl; normal values < 159 mg/dl), and triglycerides (356 mg/dl; normal values < 200 mg/dl). We also found evidence of hepatic steatosis through an abdomen ultrasound. Patient: What does that mean, doctor? Doctor: Hepatic steatosis is a condition where there is an accumulation of fat in the liver. It can be caused by multiple factors, including high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, like in your case. It's important to address this issue to prevent further complications. Patient: What should I do now, doctor? Doctor: We'll need to monitor your condition closely and develop a treatment plan to manage your symptoms and address your high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. This may include lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, and possibly medication. Patient: Alright, doctor. Thank you for your help. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll be here to support you throughout your treatment. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. [/INST] S: The patient, a long-term sufferer of muscular stiffness and grip myotonia since age 12, reports worsening symptoms over time, particularly with cold exposure but notes improvement with repetitive movement. The patient also experiences difficulties in fine finger movements and diffuse muscle stiffness, especially upon waking. O: Neurological examination revealed normal muscle strength (grade 5 MRC) and tone, with severe grip myotonia and a positive warm-up phenomenon. Lid lag, eyelid, and mild tongue myotonia were observed. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. EMG showed diffuse myotonic discharges. EKG, Holter recordings, and echocardiogram were normal. Lab tests indicated elevated CPK at 231 U/L, AST at 56 U/L, and GGT at 106 U/L. Lipid profile was elevated with total cholesterol at 260 mg/dl, LDL at 174 mg/dl, and triglycerides at 356 mg/dl. Abdomen ultrasound confirmed hepatic steatosis. A: The primary diagnosis is myotonic dystrophy, evidenced by chronic symptoms and supportive EMG findings. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of muscular dystrophy and metabolic myopathies. The elevated liver enzymes and lipid levels, along with ultrasound findings, suggest hepatic steatosis, likely secondary to dyslipidemia. P: The management plan will include close monitoring of neuromuscular symptoms and liver health. Lifestyle modifications, particularly diet and exercise, will be emphasized to manage cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Pharmacological intervention may be considered for lipid management. Regular follow-ups with neurology and possibly a referral to a hepatologist are recommended. Patient education on the importance of adherence to the treatment plan and lifestyle changes will be provided. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you were admitted to the gynecology ward for chemotherapy to treat your pulmonary metastatic uterine cervical cancer. You received cisplatin plus irinotecan infusions on day 1. How have you been feeling since then? Patient: Oh, it's been rough. On day 2, I developed a high fever, like over 40°C, had diarrhea, and noticed some blood in my urine. My right lower leg started swelling too. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We did perform a blood culture and started you on cefmetazole (CMZ) 1.0 g/day. On day 4, it seems your right lower leg swelling worsened. Your blood test showed increased serum inflammatory markers, and your acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and sequential organ assessment (SOFA) scores increased to 6 and 7, respectively. You were then transferred to our department on day 5. Patient: Yeah, that's when things got more serious. Doctor: During the initial examination at our department, your serum CRP and P-SEP levels were 28.8 mg/dL and 1,635 mg/mL, respectively. Your Glasgow Coma Scale score was 14, blood pressure 88/52 mmHg, and heart rate 90 beats/minute. We observed severe swelling in the posterior aspect of your right lower leg, but no warmth or redness. There was a 9-cm2 patch of brown skin discoloration on the anterior surface of your tibia.  Patient: Yeah, that's what I saw too. It was really concerning. Doctor: We couldn't confirm any abscess formation due to poor image quality on the contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan, as the right popliteal artery was compressed significantly by the severe swelling in your lower leg soleus muscle. Your popliteal vein was completely occluded, and deep venous thrombosis developed. Patient: That sounds serious. What did you guys do about it? Doctor: To prevent potential progression to compartment syndrome, we made a relaxing incision on the medial right lower leg. We didn't observe any distinct signs of infection in the subcutaneous tissues or muscles. Patient: Oh, that's a relief. Doctor: You were then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). We started you on nafamostat mesylate 150 mg/day and recombinant thrombomodulin 19,000 U/day to help with your condition. Patient: I see. So, what's the plan going forward, doc? Doctor: We'll closely monitor your condition in the ICU and adjust treatments as needed. It's important to keep an eye on your leg swelling, blood pressure, and heart rate. We'll also continue to manage your chemotherapy for cervical cancer. Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. I appreciate all the help and care you've been giving me. [/INST] S: The patient, a female admitted to the gynecology ward for chemotherapy treatment of pulmonary metastatic uterine cervical cancer, reports experiencing high fever (over 40°C), diarrhea, hematuria, and right lower leg swelling following chemotherapy with cisplatin and irinotecan. She expresses concern about the severity and progression of her symptoms. O: On examination, the patient's vital signs included a blood pressure of 88/52 mmHg, heart rate of 90 beats/minute, and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 14. Laboratory findings revealed elevated serum CRP (28.8 mg/dL) and P-SEP (1,635 mg/mL). Imaging showed severe swelling compressing the right popliteal artery and complete occlusion of the popliteal vein, leading to deep venous thrombosis. No abscess was detected. The patient's acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score was 6, and sequential organ assessment (SOFA) score was 7. A: The primary diagnosis is complications from chemotherapy, including severe infection indicated by high fever, elevated inflammatory markers, and potential sepsis, as well as deep venous thrombosis in the right lower leg. Differential diagnoses include compartment syndrome and localized infection, although no distinct signs of infection were observed during the surgical intervention. P: The patient has been transferred to the ICU for close monitoring and management. Treatment includes administration of nafamostat mesylate 150 mg/day and recombinant thrombomodulin 19,000 U/day. Ongoing management will focus on monitoring leg swelling, blood pressure, heart rate, and adjusting treatments as necessary. Chemotherapy for cervical cancer will continue with careful consideration of her current state and complications. Regular reassessment of her condition will be essential to adapt the treatment plan accordingly. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've been referred to our ENT department with a complaint of throat pain for one month. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. I've had this pain for a while now. Doctor: Is there any history of smoking or alcohol consumption? Patient: No, I don't smoke or drink. Doctor: Have you experienced any difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) or shortness of breath (dyspnea)? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those issues. But I do have pain when swallowing (odynophagia). Doctor: I see. So, you mentioned that you received treatment with antibiotics from your primary care physician, but it wasn't effective, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. The antibiotics didn't seem to help with the pain. Doctor: During the physical examination, we noticed an enlarged right palatine tonsil with ulcerating mucosa and fullness of your anterior tonsillar pillar. The left palatine tonsil and other pharyngeal mucosal surfaces were normal. The remainder examination of head and neck was negative. We performed a computed tomography (CT) scan of your neck, which showed a 3.5 x 2.8 cm mass posterior to the right submandibular gland and increased attenuation within the right tonsil. Have you experienced any discomfort in that area? Patient: Hmm, I didn't realize there was a mass, but I've felt some discomfort there. Doctor: We also conducted a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which were all unremarkable. A whole body positron emission tomography (PET-CT) showed a prominent collection of fluorodeoxyglucose within your right tonsillar fossa but no evidence of distant metastatic disease. This is a good sign as it indicates that the cancer hasn't spread to other parts of your body. Patient: Oh, that's a relief. Doctor: We performed a fine-needle aspiration of the right neck mass, which was positive for poorly differentiated carcinoma. On endoscopy, we observed a very small exophytic tumor involving the right palatine tonsil. We took several biopsies for histology. Patient: What did the histology results show? Doctor: The histologic examination revealed small round to oval tumor cells arranged in cords or nests, containing hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm, nuclear molding, numerous mitotic figures, and apoptotic bodies. Immunohistochemical staining showed that tumor cells were strongly positive for neural cell adhesion molecule (CD56), Synaptophysin, Chromogranin, NSE, and negative for leukocyte common antigen (LCA) and CD 20. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: Based on these findings, you have been diagnosed with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCC) of the right tonsil. The right palatine tonsil was confirmed as the primary lesion, and there is no evidence of distant metastasis. Patient: What are my treatment options? Doctor: Typically, we would recommend surgery or radiotherapy. However, I understand that you have refused both options. In that case, we can proceed with six cycles of Cisplatin and Etoposide chemotherapy, which has proven to be effective for patients with this type of cancer. It is important to discuss your preferences and concerns with your oncologist to determine the best course of action for you. Patient: Thank you for explaining everything. I'll discuss my options with my family and oncologist. [/INST] S: The patient, referred to the ENT department, reports a one-month history of throat pain, specifically odynophagia, without dysphagia or dyspnea. The patient denies any history of smoking or alcohol consumption. Previous antibiotic treatment was ineffective in alleviating symptoms. O: Physical examination revealed an enlarged right palatine tonsil with ulcerating mucosa and fullness of the anterior tonsillar pillar, while the left tonsil and other pharyngeal surfaces appeared normal. CT scan of the neck identified a 3.5 x 2.8 cm mass posterior to the right submandibular gland with increased attenuation in the right tonsil. Chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT scans were unremarkable. PET-CT showed localized fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the right tonsillar fossa, with no signs of distant metastasis. Fine-needle aspiration confirmed poorly differentiated carcinoma. Histologic examination indicated a neuroendocrine carcinoma, positive for CD56, Synaptophysin, Chromogranin, NSE, and negative for LCA and CD20. A: Diagnosis of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the right tonsil, with the primary lesion localized to the right palatine tonsil and no evidence of distant metastasis. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of tonsillar or oropharyngeal malignancies, but these are less likely given the specific immunohistochemical profile. P: The patient has refused surgery and radiotherapy. The recommended treatment plan includes six cycles of chemotherapy with Cisplatin and Etoposide. The patient is advised to discuss treatment preferences and concerns with an oncologist to finalize the management plan. Regular follow-up appointments will be necessary to monitor the response to treatment and manage any potential complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're a 64-year-old male smoker who has been referred to our department for the management of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. You also have central airway obstruction and recurrent pulmonary infections. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: It seems that immunohistochemistry results showed a strong positive expression of PD-L1 in over 50% of the tumor cells, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Have you been experiencing recurrent episodes of pneumonia related to atelectasis of the right lung? Patient: Yes, I have had pneumonia several times, and it's been really hard to breathe. Doctor: I see. Your recent chest CT scan performed at the admission shows a severe stricture of the right main bronchus, with atelectasis of the middle lobe and pneumonia of the right lower lobe. Your severe acute respiratory distress and poor performance status (ECOG 3) are concerning. Patient: Oh, that's not good. Doctor: Although Pembrolizumab is indicated as the first therapeutic option for your condition, it's unfeasible due to the recurrent episodes of obstructive pneumonia of the right lung. So, after a multimodal assessment, we've decided to schedule you for endoscopic recanalization of the right main bronchus before starting ICI treatment.  Patient: Okay, what does that procedure involve? Doctor: The procedure will be performed under general anesthesia. You will be intubated with an 8.5 mm rigid bronchoscope. Your right main bronchus is currently completely obstructed by the tumor at the level of the carina. We will use mechanical coring with rigid bronchoscopy, debulking with forceps, and control of bleeding with an Nd:YAP laser to resect the tumor and obtain the complete recanalization of the right main bronchus and the middle and lower bronchus. Patient: I see. What happens after that? Doctor: After the recanalization, we will insert a fully covered SEMS (size: 14 mm diameter; 40 mm length) into the right main bronchus to maintain airway patency. This should help alleviate your dyspnea. Patient: And when can I expect to be discharged after the procedure? Doctor: Typically, the dyspnea should disappear the day after the procedure, and you can expect to be discharged three days later. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. We will do our best to ensure a successful procedure and help you manage your condition. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. [/INST] S: The patient is a 64-year-old male smoker with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, central airway obstruction, and recurrent pulmonary infections. He reports recurrent episodes of pneumonia and significant breathing difficulties. The patient confirms his diagnosis and symptoms as described. O: Immunohistochemistry shows strong positive expression of PD-L1 in over 50% of tumor cells, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Recent chest CT scan reveals severe stricture of the right main bronchus, atelectasis of the middle lobe, and pneumonia in the right lower lobe. The patient's performance status is ECOG 3, indicating severe disability. A: The primary diagnosis is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma with central airway obstruction and recurrent pneumonia. The patient's condition is complicated by the obstruction in the right main bronchus and recurrent obstructive pneumonia, which currently contraindicates the use of Pembrolizumab. The prognosis is guarded due to the advanced stage of cancer and recurrent infections. P: The immediate management plan includes endoscopic recanalization of the right main bronchus under general anesthesia using a rigid bronchoscope, mechanical coring, debulking with forceps, and bleeding control with an Nd:YAP laser. Post-procedure, a fully covered SEMS will be inserted to maintain airway patency. The patient is expected to experience relief from dyspnea the day after the procedure and may be discharged three days post-procedure. Further treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) will be considered following successful airway management. Regular follow-ups will be necessary to monitor the patient's response to the treatment and manage any complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I came to the urgent care center two days ago because I thought I had conjunctivitis. They prescribed me polymyxin, but now my head feels swollen and my throat is starting to swell too. Doctor: I see. Let me just check your previous records. It says here that you're a 52-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities, including obesity and chronic use of prednisone for pulmonary fibrosis. Have you experienced any allergic reactions before? Patient: No, I haven't. But I thought this might be one, so I used my EpiPen, but it didn't help. Doctor: Okay, let's check your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg, pulse is 120 bpm, temperature is 36.8°C, respiratory rate is 22, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. I do see some posterior oropharyngeal edema. We'll treat you for possible anaphylaxis, and see if that helps. Patient: Alright, thank you. (After some time) Doctor: Unfortunately, the treatment didn't seem to improve your condition. We also noticed that you're developing acute vision loss in your right eye. We'll need to transfer you to our downtown campus ED for an ophthalmological specialty evaluation. Patient: Okay, I hope they can figure out what's going on. (After the transfer) Doctor: After examining you further, we found severe bilateral periorbital swelling and severe chemosis. Repeated extraocular motor tests showed an initial unilateral ophthalmoplegia which later progressed to bilateral cranial nerves III, IV, and VI palsies. Your pupillary light-response exam revealed relative afferent pupillary defects, suggesting retinal and/or optic nerve involvement. Patient: Oh no, what does that mean? Doctor: We also found that your labs are consistent with steroid-induced diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a white blood cell count of 18,400 cells per microliter with 96% neutrophils, and acute kidney injury. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed right proptosis, right periorbital soft tissue swelling, and mucosal thickening within all the paranasal sinuses. However, the CT couldn't characterize the cavernous sinus without venous contrast phase. Patient: What's the next step, then? Doctor: We've consulted ophthalmology, and they reported a funduscopic exam that revealed a retinal pattern consistent with right eye central retinal involvement. We'll continue to monitor your condition and evaluate further to determine the best course of treatment. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all your help. [/INST] S: A 52-year-old female patient with a history of obesity and chronic prednisone use for pulmonary fibrosis presented with initial symptoms of conjunctivitis treated with polymyxin. She subsequently developed symptoms suggestive of an allergic reaction, including head and throat swelling, unresponsive to epinephrine administration. She also reported acute vision loss in the right eye. O: Vital signs showed hypertension (160/90 mmHg), tachycardia (pulse 120 bpm), normal temperature (36.8°C), slightly elevated respiratory rate (22), and normal oxygen saturation (100% on room air). Physical examination revealed posterior oropharyngeal edema, severe bilateral periorbital swelling, severe chemosis, and progression from unilateral to bilateral cranial nerves III, IV, and VI palsies. Labs indicated steroid-induced diabetic ketoacidosis, leukocytosis (WBC 18,400 cells/µL with 96% neutrophils), and acute kidney injury. CT imaging showed right proptosis, right periorbital soft tissue swelling, and mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses. Funduscopic exam suggested right eye central retinal involvement. A: The primary diagnosis is severe allergic reaction potentially progressing to anaphylaxis, complicated by acute vision loss likely due to optic nerve involvement. Differential diagnoses include cavernous sinus thrombosis and complications related to chronic steroid use, such as diabetic ketoacidosis and acute kidney injury. P: The patient was treated for anaphylaxis and transferred to a specialized facility for further ophthalmological evaluation. Management includes continued monitoring of vital signs, blood glucose levels, and kidney function. Consultations with ophthalmology and possibly neurology are planned to further assess and manage the cranial nerve palsies and vision loss. Education on the signs of steroid-induced complications and the importance of regular monitoring was provided. Compliance with treatment and follow-up in specialized clinics will be crucial for her ongoing care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today? Patient: Not too bad, doc. Just a bit worried about my recent surgery. Doctor: I understand. You underwent an Ivor Lewis procedure for a T2N0 well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus. How did you feel after the surgery? Patient: I was doing well until about six days after the surgery. I suddenly felt feverish and really unwell. Doctor: Yes, I see here that on postoperative day six, you became febrile with a temperature of 102 °F, and your white cell count rose to 21 k/mm3. We performed a chest computed tomography (CT) scan, which revealed an anastomotic leak and a loculated abscess formation.  Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What did you do to treat it? Doctor: We inserted a chest tube to drain the abscess, control the leak, and obtain microbiological cultures. We also started you on broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage, including metronidazole 500 mg intravenous every eight hours and ceftriaxone 2 g intravenous every 24 hours. Patient: I remember having an Esophagogastroscopy too. What did that show? Doctor: The Esophagogastroscopy revealed a 1-cm disruption at the gastroesophageal anastomosis. To address this, our gastroenterologist deployed a 23-French (diameter), 8-cm (length) fully covered metal stent to cover the leaking area. Patient: Did my condition improve after that? Doctor: Yes, your condition dramatically improved after the stent placement. Your temperature and white count normalized. We conducted an Esophagogram a week later, which demonstrated control of the leak. Patient: That's a relief. So, am I well enough to be discharged from the hospital? Doctor: Yes, you've done well and are now ready to be discharged. Please make sure to follow up with your healthcare team for any further care and monitoring. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all the care and attention I've received here. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. [/INST] S: The patient, who recently underwent an Ivor Lewis procedure for T2N0 well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, reported feeling feverish and unwell six days post-surgery. The patient expressed concerns about the seriousness of these symptoms. O: On postoperative day six, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 102 °F and had an elevated white cell count of 21 k/mm3. A chest CT scan showed an anastomotic leak and a loculated abscess. Esophagogastroscopy revealed a 1-cm disruption at the gastroesophageal anastomosis. A 23-French, 8-cm fully covered metal stent was successfully placed to control the leak.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, you must be the patient who was referred to our department. I see that you had an MR scan showing a right fronto-opercular diffuse low-grade glioma. We want to perform a diagnostic work-up for your headache. Before we proceed, I noticed that you are left-handed. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. I'm left-handed. Doctor: Great, we confirmed your left-handedness with Edinburgh's inventory. Have you experienced any language disorders before the surgery? Patient: No, I haven't had any language disorders. Doctor: Good to know. After navigation-guided identification of the tumor boundaries, we performed an ""awake"" resection. During the surgery, we were able to identify Broca's area with ""speech arrest"" and the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF) with transient fonemic paraphasia. Then, we stopped the resection.  Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: Histology provided evidence for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)-mutated, ATP-Dependent Helicase (ATRX)-wild diffuse low-grade astrocytoma. Your postoperative MR showed a subtotal removal with residual disease where the IFOF was intraoperatively identified. At this time, we are not proposing any adjuvant therapy. Patient: Okay, so what's the plan moving forward? Doctor: You can continue with your daily activities, as you are currently fully working. If we observe evidence of residual disease progression, we will propose a new surgery, delaying eventual adjuvant therapy as much as possible. Patient: So, is this approach common? Doctor: Yes, this is an example of the ""multi-staged"" approach to dealing with diffuse low-grade gliomas. Our goal is to get control of the disease as much as possible, postponing chemotherapy or radiotherapy as far as possible, and reserving them for when surgery can no longer be performed. Patient: I see. Thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your condition closely. If you have any concerns or notice any changes in your symptoms, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. [/INST] S: The patient, a left-handed individual, was referred for a diagnostic work-up related to headaches. The patient has undergone an ""awake"" resection of a right fronto-opercular diffuse low-grade glioma, during which Broca's area and the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle were identified, with noted speech arrest and transient fonemic paraphasia respectively. The patient reports no history of language disorders prior to the surgery. O: The patient's MR scan initially showed a right fronto-opercular diffuse low-grade glioma. Postoperative MR imaging indicated a subtotal removal with residual disease near the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle. Histology confirmed the tumor as an isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)-mutated, ATP-Dependent Helicase (ATRX)-wild diffuse low-grade astrocytoma. A: The primary diagnosis is a right fronto-opercular diffuse low-grade astrocytoma, IDH1-mutated and ATRX-wild type. The surgical intervention aimed at maximal safe resection was partially successful, with residual disease remaining. The prognosis involves close monitoring and potential further surgeries, with adjuvant therapies delayed to preserve quality of life and functionality. P: The current plan involves no immediate adjuvant therapy. The patient is advised to continue normal daily activities and full work duties. Regular monitoring of the residual disease will be conducted to detect any progression. In case of disease progression, further surgical interventions will be considered before initiating chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The patient is encouraged to report any new symptoms or changes in condition immediately. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, doc. I have had this productive cough for about two years now and it's getting worse. I also feel short of breath. Doctor: I see. Do you have any prior medical history that we should be aware of? Patient: No, I don't have any medical history, but I've been a smoker for 40 pack-years. Doctor: Alright. Let me perform a physical exam to check your condition. *examines patient* I noticed some mild fine bibasilar crackles on your lung exam but no wheezing. We'll need to run some tests to understand the underlying issue.  *After the tests* Doctor: The results of your arterial blood gas analysis show a lower PaO2 of 74.4 mmHg on room air, and your serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level is high at 1655 U/mL. Your pulmonary function testing reveals severe irreversible obstructive ventilatory dysfunction, but your diffusing capacity of the lung is normal. Patient: Oh, what does that mean, doc? Doctor: We performed a computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest and it revealed irregular wall thickening of the trachea and bilateral bronchi. Bilateral bronchiectasis, and mediastinal and both hilar lymphadenopathy were also noted. Patient: And what about the bronchoscopy? Doctor: The bronchoscopy demonstrated a diffuse irregular surface of the tracheal and bilateral bronchial mucosa and multiple macroscopic submucosal nodules involving the trachea, the distal trachea above the major carina, and throughout the left and right main bronchi. Patient: That sounds concerning. What's the diagnosis? Doctor: The endobronchial biopsy of the mucosa on the major carina showed a population of small atypical lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei of irregular nuclear contours. These atypical lymphocytes are CD20 positive B-cells that co-express CD5, blc-2, and Cyclin D1. This leads to the diagnosis of MCL. Patient: What about the PET-CT imaging? Doctor: The positron emission tomography (PET)-CT imaging showed persistent FDG-avid lymphadenopathy within the chest (SUVmax 4.2) and FDG-avid wall thickening of the trachea and bilateral main bronchi (SUVmax 2.8), as well as FDG-avid nasopharyngeal soft tissue thickening (SUVmax 6.8). Patient: What do the biopsies of the nasopharyngeal mucosa show? Doctor: The biopsies further demonstrated B-cells with the same immunophenotype as the endobronchial biopsy. The 11;14 translocation was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: We'll need to discuss your treatment options and follow-up requirements based on the diagnosis. It's important to keep monitoring your condition and maintain regular check-ups. Patient: Alright, thank you, doc. I'll follow your recommendations. [/INST] S: The patient, a 40 pack-year smoker, reports a productive cough persisting for two years, which has recently worsened, accompanied by shortness of breath. No other medical history was noted. O: Physical examination revealed mild fine bibasilar crackles; no wheezing was observed. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a decreased PaO2 of 74.4 mmHg. Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor level was elevated at 1655 U/mL. Pulmonary function tests indicated severe irreversible obstructive ventilatory dysfunction with normal diffusing capacity. CT scan of the chest displayed irregular wall thickening of the trachea and bilateral bronchi, bilateral bronchiectasis, and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. Bronchoscopy showed a diffuse irregular surface of the tracheal and bilateral bronchial mucosa with multiple submucosal nodules. Endobronchial biopsy identified atypical lymphocytes positive for CD20, CD5, blc-2, and Cyclin D1, consistent with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). PET-CT imaging revealed FDG-avid lymphadenopathy and wall thickening in the chest and nasopharyngeal area. Biopsies of the nasopharyngeal mucosa confirmed the presence of B-cells with the same immunophenotype as the endobronchial biopsy, and the 11;14 translocation was confirmed. A: The primary diagnosis is mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), evidenced by biopsy results and imaging studies. The patient's respiratory symptoms and findings suggest involvement of the respiratory tract by MCL, which is relatively rare and may complicate the prognosis. P: The management plan will include referral to an oncologist for further evaluation and treatment of MCL, which may involve chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapy depending on further oncological assessment. Smoking cessation will be strongly advised to help improve respiratory symptoms and overall health. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient's response to treatment and any progression of symptoms. Patient education regarding the nature of the diagnosis and the importance of adherence to the treatment plan will be provided. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you are a 77-year-old female with hypertension, untreated hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism, but without a prior history of CAD or angina symptoms. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been experiencing some new onset palpitations, so my primary care doctor referred me here for a treadmill exercise test. Doctor: Alright. Besides the palpitations, have you experienced any chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, exertional dyspnea, or leg swelling? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. Doctor: Good to know. It's also worth noting that you quit smoking 36 years ago and have no family history of early cardiovascular diseases. Have you ever had any cardiac work-ups before? Patient: Yes, I had a stress test and an echocardiogram years ago, but they were unremarkable. Doctor: Okay, let's check your vital signs before we proceed with the treadmill exercise test. Your blood pressure is 140/78, heart rate is 80, and respiratory rate is 14. The physical exam is unremarkable except for a systolic ejection murmur that's graded II/VI at the base. Your EKG is at baseline with a normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, and occasional premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). Patient: Alright. Doctor: We'll now conduct an exercise stress test using the Bruce protocol. You'll need to exercise for three minutes at a speed of 1.7 mph and a 10% incline. Are you ready? Patient: Yes, let's do this. Doctor: Great, you were able to complete stage 1 of the exercise. However, we had to terminate the test due to dyspnea and fatigue without chest pain. You reached a heart rate of 141 beats per minute, which is 98% of predicted for your age, and accomplished 4.5 metabolic equivalents of exertion. With exercise, you had occasional atrial premature complexes and PVCs with a ventricular couplet in recovery. Did you notice any tightness in your chest during the test? Patient: Yes, now that you mention it, I did feel some tightness in my chest. Doctor: Your peak blood pressure during the test was 218/90. We need to transfer you onto a stretcher and start an IV line. We'll give you sublingual nitroglycerin, 325 mg of aspirin to chew, and one 5 mg IV push of metoprolol tartrate. You'll also receive nitroglycerin paste and metoprolol tartrate IV every 5 minutes for two more doses. Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. Doctor: On the stretcher, your EKG showed ST elevations in leads I, aVL, and V5. We'll continue to monitor you closely, and I'll discuss the next steps with you once we have more information. Patient: Alright, I appreciate your help, doctor. [/INST] S: 77-year-old female with a history of hypertension, untreated hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism presents with new onset palpitations. She denies chest pain, pressure, shortness of breath, exertional dyspnea, or leg swelling. She has a history of smoking, which she quit 36 years ago, and no family history of early cardiovascular diseases. Previous cardiac evaluations including a stress test and echocardiogram were unremarkable. O: Vital signs show blood pressure at 140/78, heart rate at 80, and respiratory rate at 14. Physical exam reveals a II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the base. Baseline EKG shows normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, and occasional PVCs. During the treadmill exercise test, the patient reached a heart rate of 141 bpm (98% of predicted for age) and achieved 4.5 METs but experienced dyspnea and fatigue leading to test termination. She reported chest tightness during the test. Peak blood pressure was 218/90. Post-test EKG showed ST elevations in leads I, aVL, and V5. A: The patient's symptoms and test results suggest acute coronary syndrome, likely an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), precipitated by exercise stress testing. Differential diagnoses include unstable angina or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). P: Immediate management included administration of sublingual nitroglycerin, 325 mg of chewable aspirin, and 5 mg IV push of metoprolol tartrate, followed by repeated doses of nitroglycerin and metoprolol. The patient was placed on a stretcher for continuous monitoring. Further management will include cardiac enzyme analysis, continuous EKG monitoring, and cardiology consultation for possible coronary angiography. Patient education will focus on recognizing symptoms of cardiac events and adherence to prescribed therapies. Follow-up will be scheduled based on cardiology's recommendations and test results. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're a 12-year-old female who recently presented to the local emergency room with persistent intense left flank pain. Can you tell me more about that? Patient: Yeah, the pain was really bad and it wouldn't go away. Doctor: I see. In the emergency room, a dipstick test showed large blood, and an abdominal CT revealed a 4 mm obstructing calculus in your proximal left ureter, nephrolithiasis with minimal scarring in the upper pole of your left kidney, and multiple bilateral renal cysts. The dominant cyst on your left kidney measured 2.8 mm. They also identified non-calcified 2 mm nodules in your right lower lobe of the lung. Your renal function was preserved with a BUN of 11 mg/dl and creatinine of 0.6 mg/dl, and your electrolytes were within the normal range. Were you treated with any medications for pain control and hydration? Patient: Yes, they gave me some pain control medications and I felt better after getting some hydration. Doctor: That's good to hear. You were then referred to a nephrologist, who conducted a 24-hour urine ""stone risk study"" and a renal ultrasound (RUS). The RUS showed multiple bilateral cysts and renal calculi in your kidneys. The right kidney measured 10.5 cm × 4.9 cm × 4.8 cm and the left kidney measured 9.8 cm × 4.7 cm × 5.0 cm. Renal cysts were present bilaterally, with some displaying thick internal septation (Bosniak type II renal cyst). The largest cyst was in your left kidney, measuring 3.3 mm. There were no solid masses present. An extrarenal pelvis was present on the left, but there was no caliectasis. Are you following me so far? Patient: Yeah, I think so. Doctor: The 24-hour urine ""stone study"" showed elevated levels of calcium oxalate, brushite, and monosodium urate. Since you have a strong family history of kidney issues, with both your father and paternal grandmother having a history of never genetically tested ADPKD, and considering the radiological and clinical findings, you underwent genetic testing for PKD1, PKD2, GANAB, and HNF1B. The genomic DNA from the submitted specimens was captured and sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) on an Illumina platform.  Patient: So, what does all that mean, doc? Doctor: It means that we have conducted thorough testing to better understand your kidney condition, considering your family history and the symptoms you have been experiencing. The genetic testing will help us determine if you have any genetic predispositions for kidney disorders. We will discuss the results once they are available and plan the best course of action for your treatment. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. In the meantime, continue to monitor your symptoms and let me know if you experience any worsening pain or new symptoms. We will schedule a follow-up appointment when your test results are ready. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. Patient: Okay, I will. Thanks again, doc. Doctor: My pleasure. Take care, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. [/INST] S: The patient is a 12-year-old female who presented with persistent intense left flank pain. She reported that the pain was severe and unrelenting. She has a family history of kidney issues, with both her father and paternal grandmother having a history of never genetically tested ADPKD. O: In the emergency room, a dipstick test showed large blood. An abdominal CT scan revealed a 4 mm obstructing calculus in the proximal left ureter, nephrolithiasis with minimal scarring in the upper pole of the left kidney, and multiple bilateral renal cysts. The dominant cyst on the left kidney measured 2.8 mm. Non-calcified 2 mm nodules were identified in the right lower lobe of the lung. Renal function was preserved with a BUN of 11 mg/dl (normal range: 7-20 mg/dl) and creatinine of 0.6 mg/dl (normal range: 0.5-1.2 mg/dl). Electrolytes were within normal limits. A renal ultrasound showed multiple bilateral cysts and renal calculi, with the largest cyst measuring 3.3 mm. The 24-hour urine ""stone risk study"" showed elevated levels of calcium oxalate, brushite, and monosodium urate. Genetic testing for PKD1, PKD2, GANAB, and HNF1B was conducted using next-generation sequencing. A: The primary diagnosis is nephrolithiasis with obstructing calculus and multiple bilateral renal cysts. Differential diagnoses include autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), considering the family history and radiological findings. The presence of non-calcified nodules in the lung may warrant further investigation to rule out any related or unrelated pulmonary conditions. P: The patient was treated with pain control medications and hydration, which improved her symptoms. She was referred to a nephrologist for further management. The plan includes monitoring symptoms and scheduling a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the genetic testing and determine the appropriate treatment strategy. The patient is advised to continue monitoring her symptoms and report any worsening pain or new symptoms. Further consultations with a pulmonologist may be considered based on the lung nodule findings. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you've presented with progressive shortness of breath for the last three months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, I've also had this intermittent cough with yellowish sputum and dyspnoea upon exertion for about half a year now. Doctor: I see. Do you have any history of medical conditions or family history of diseases? Patient: I have well-controlled hypertension, and I smoke one pack of cigarettes per day. My family history is remarkable for adenocarcinoma of the lung. Doctor: Have you traveled anywhere recently? Patient: I traveled to Yunnan, China, in the past year. Doctor: Okay. You mentioned that you visited a pulmonologist a month prior to admission. What were the results of that visit? Patient: The chest X-ray showed increased infiltration over bilateral lung fields. They gave me oral azithromycin, but my dyspnoea got worse. Doctor: I see. When you visited our clinic, did you experience any fever, joint pain, dry eyes or mouth, muscle weakness, pitting oedema over lower legs, or skin rash? Patient: No, I didn't have any of those symptoms. Doctor: During the physical examination, we noticed fine crackles over bilateral lung fields on chest auscultation. The chest X-ray also showed diffuse interstitial infiltration bilaterally (Fig.). We admitted you for further workup and monitoring of your respiratory performance. Patient: Alright. Doctor: During hospitalization, you had no fever, and your respiratory pattern was smooth. The peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 95% under ambient air. Your white blood cell count showed no leucocytosis or left shift. Patient: Okay. Doctor: We also tested for autoimmune markers, such as rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, anti-Smith antibody, anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody, anti-SSA, and anti-SSB, which were all negative. Patient: Hmm, I see. Doctor: We performed a polymerase chain reaction test for Pneumocystis jiroveci from your induced sputum, which was negative. One of three sets of sputum culture demonstrated non-tuberculous mycobacteria, but this was later attributed to environmental contamination because of your symptoms and image findings. Patient: Oh, alright. Doctor: The chest CT showed extensive patchy ground-glass opacities superimposed with thickened interlobular septa and intralobular lines over both lung fields, demonstrating a “crazy paving” pattern. Patient: So, what does that mean for me, doc? Doctor: We will continue to monitor your respiratory performance and discuss further treatment options based on your test results. It's important to keep an eye on your symptoms and report any changes. Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, a smoker with a history of well-controlled hypertension, presents with progressive shortness of breath over the last three months, intermittent cough with yellowish sputum, and dyspnoea upon exertion for approximately six months. The patient has a family history of adenocarcinoma of the lung and traveled to Yunnan, China, within the past year. Previous treatment with oral azithromycin did not improve symptoms. O: Physical examination revealed fine crackles over bilateral lung fields. Chest X-ray and CT scan showed diffuse interstitial infiltration and extensive patchy ground-glass opacities with a ""crazy paving"" pattern, respectively. Laboratory tests showed normal white blood cell count and negative autoimmune markers. SpO2 was 95% on room air. PCR for Pneumocystis jiroveci and sputum cultures were negative, except for a non-significant growth of non-tuberculous mycobacteria. A: The patient's clinical presentation and imaging are suggestive of an interstitial lung disease, possibly due to environmental or occupational exposure, given the smoking history and travel. Differential diagnoses could include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or a connective tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease, although autoimmune tests were negative. P: Continue monitoring respiratory function and symptoms closely. Consider a follow-up high-resolution CT scan and consultation with a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management, including potential lung biopsy to clarify the diagnosis. Smoking cessation is strongly advised to prevent further lung damage. Educate the patient on the importance of avoiding known lung irritants and adhering to treatment recommendations. Regular follow-up appointments should be scheduled to assess progress and adjust treatment as necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you tell me about your past medical history? Patient: Hmm, I don't really have any significant past medical issues. Doctor: I see. What brought you to the hospital today? Patient: I've been having abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for the past eight days. I also experienced chills, but I don't think I had a fever. Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Do you have any social medical history you'd like to disclose? Patient: Well, I do use intravenous heroin. Doctor: Thank you for being honest. We're going to admit you to the medical floor for further evaluation and management. *Patient gets admitted and develops respiratory decompensation* Doctor: It seems like you've developed respiratory decompensation, so we're moving you to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer observation. Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. Doctor: We'll be monitoring you closely. You've also started spiking high-grade fevers, so we're going to start you on cefepime and vancomycin as a precaution. *Doctor orders a chest computed tomography (CT)* Doctor: The CT scan showed septic pulmonary emboli. Unfortunately, you had to be intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. We received the results of your blood cultures, and they came back positive for MRSA. Patient: Oh, that's not good. Doctor: Your sputum culture also came back positive for MRSA. As a result, we've de-escalated your antibiotics to vancomycin only. A two-dimensional (2D) transthoracic echocardiogram showed pulmonic valve endocarditis, pulmonic valve insufficiency, and tricuspid regurgitation. Patient: So what's the next step for my treatment? Doctor: We've been maintaining a vancomycin trough between 15 and 20 mcg/dl. However, your blood cultures have remained persistently positive for MRSA. The initial blood cultures showed a vancomycin MIC of 1.0, but after around 10 days, it increased to 2.0. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: To treat your MRSA bacteremia, we've initiated daptomycin 10 mg/kg and continued vancomycin for your MRSA pneumonia. Unfortunately, your blood cultures are still positive despite the addition of daptomycin. Patient: What are we going to do now? Doctor: After a discussion with the critical-care team, we've decided to discontinue your current antibiotics and start you on ceftaroline fosamil 600 mg intravenous (IV) every 8 hours. This dosing is meant to address the more severe infection of endocarditis, persistent positive bacteremia, and MRSA pneumonia. Patient: I see. I hope this works. Doctor: After two additional days of ceftaroline fosamil use, your blood culture finally became negative. We'll keep monitoring you in the ICU for another two days before considering transferring you to a lower level of care. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all the efforts to help me get better. [/INST] S: The patient, with no significant past medical history, presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting for eight days, and chills but no fever. The patient disclosed intravenous heroin use. Symptoms progressed to respiratory decompensation after admission. O: On admission, the patient was moved to ICU due to respiratory decompensation and started on cefepime and vancomycin due to high-grade fevers. Chest CT indicated septic pulmonary emboli, and the patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Blood and sputum cultures were positive for MRSA. A 2D echocardiogram showed pulmonic valve endocarditis, pulmonic valve insufficiency, and tricuspid regurgitation. Despite treatment adjustments, including daptomycin and continued vancomycin, blood cultures remained positive. Vancomycin MIC increased from 1.0 to 2.0. The patient was then started on ceftaroline fosamil 600 mg IV every 8 hours, leading to negative blood cultures after two days. A: The primary diagnosis is MRSA bacteremia complicated by septic pulmonary emboli, MRSA pneumonia, and pulmonic valve endocarditis. Differential diagnoses initially included other causes of bacteremia and endocarditis. The prognosis is guarded given the severity of the infections and complications including multi-valve involvement and persistent bacteremia. P: The management plan includes continuation of ceftaroline fosamil 600 mg IV every 8 hours. The patient will remain in the ICU for close monitoring for another two days before considering a transfer to a lower level of care. The treatment regimen will be adjusted based on clinical response and further culture results. Patient education regarding the severity of the infections and the importance of adherence to the treatment plan is crucial. Referral to addiction services and a follow-up plan for the management of heroin use disorder are also necessary to address underlying issues and prevent recurrence. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see from your history that you've had two cervical surgeries, the first one in 1987 and the second in 2003, with placement of titanium plates and screws at C4-C5 and C5-C6. Can you tell me about your symptoms since 2005? Patient: Yeah, in 2005, I started experiencing fatigue, chills, headaches, nausea, and asymmetric arthralgia. I also noticed malar rash after sun exposure and a fluctuating rash in my trunk area. Doctor: I also see that you had a physical examination that revealed arthritis of the left shoulder and left ankle, livedo reticularis, and an erythematous cutaneous rash in the thorax. No infection foci were detected, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Your laboratory studies showed thrombocytosis of 485,000 cells/mm3 while the normal range is 130,000-400,000 cells/mm3, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 75 mg/dl with the normal range being 0.1-1.0 mg/dl, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 40 mm/h, while the normal range is 0-20 mm/h. Your autoantibodies were negative, and your complement levels were within the normal range.  Patient: Hmm, alright. Doctor: From 2005 to 2007, you had no treatment, and your symptoms had a fluctuating course. In 2007, you experienced fatigue, rash, and arthralgia again, and developed edema in your hands and feet. You were prescribed prednisone and methotrexate by a rheumatologist, but there was no improvement, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Six months later, you started experiencing dysphagia, halitosis, and ""sputum"" production of a purulent aspect. You consulted an ear, nose, and throat specialist, but they didn't find any abnormalities, right? Patient: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: You continued to have elevated CRP, ESR, and thrombocytosis. A labeled leukocyte single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) suggested spondylitis in the cervical spine (C4-C6) and revealed an inflammatory process in the nasopharynx, an increase in the prevertebral space of > 2 cm, and free air in this area.  Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: An esophagogram with hyd was also performed. Based on your symptoms and these test results, we need to discuss further treatment options and closely monitor your condition. It's important to regularly follow up with your rheumatologist and other specialists to manage your symptoms effectively. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything. I'll make sure to follow up with my doctors. [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing fatigue, chills, headaches, nausea, and asymmetric arthralgia since 2005, along with malar rash after sun exposure and a fluctuating rash on the trunk. Symptoms had a fluctuating course with no treatment from 2005 to 2007, followed by the development of edema in hands and feet in 2007. The patient also experienced dysphagia, halitosis, and purulent sputum production starting six months later. Previous treatments with prednisone and methotrexate showed no improvement. O: Physical examination revealed arthritis in the left shoulder and ankle, livedo reticularis, and an erythematous cutaneous rash in the thorax. Laboratory findings included thrombocytosis (485,000 cells/mm3), elevated CRP (75 mg/dl), and ESR (40 mm/h). Autoantibodies were negative, and complement levels were normal. Imaging with labeled leukocyte SPECT indicated spondylitis at C4-C6 and an inflammatory process in the nasopharynx, with an increase in the prevertebral space of > 2 cm and presence of free air. A: The primary diagnosis is cervical spondylitis with associated systemic inflammatory response, evidenced by elevated inflammatory markers and imaging findings. Differential diagnoses could include autoimmune disorders, given the rash and arthralgia, but negative autoantibodies and normal complement levels make this less likely. The presence of free air and an increase in prevertebral space suggests a possible esophageal perforation or deep space infection. P: The management plan will include close monitoring of the inflammatory process and structural abnormalities in the cervical spine. The patient will continue follow-up with rheumatology and should consult with a gastroenterologist for the evaluation of potential esophageal involvement. Further imaging and possibly a repeat esophagogram may be necessary to assess the integrity of the esophagus and prevertebral space. Adjustments in anti-inflammatory medication may be required based on ongoing symptoms and lab results. Regular follow-ups to monitor the condition and treatment efficacy are essential. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been having this cyclic pain for a while now. It's more at the left rectus muscle, away from the cesarean scar I have from a delivery several years ago. Doctor: I see. Have you consulted any doctors regarding this pain before? Patient: Yes, I went to my obstetrician who prescribed me analgesics and hormonal therapy, like oral contraceptives and gonatropin-releasing hormone agonist, but they didn't really help with the pain. Doctor: I understand. Let's run some tests to see what might be causing the pain. We can start with an ultrasound and a CT scan to get a better look at the area. (After the tests) Doctor: The results from the ultrasound and CT scan confirm the presence of a mid-rectus lesion, which indicates endometriosis. Patient: Oh no, what do we do now? Doctor: We will perform an excision of the mass to remove the lesion and then reinforce the area with mesh. This should help alleviate the pain you've been experiencing. Patient: Okay, I hope that works. What do the pathology results say? Doctor: The pathology results confirm the presence of endometrial stroma, which is consistent with endometriosis. Patient: So, after the surgery, will I be disease-free? Doctor: Yes, after the excision and mesh reinforcement, you should be disease-free. However, we will need to see you regularly for check-ups, at least for the first two months after surgery. Patient: Alright, I'll make sure to follow up with you. Thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient reports cyclic pain localized at the left rectus muscle, distinct from a previous cesarean scar.

Pathology results post-surgical excision confirmed the presence of endometrial stroma, consistent with endometriosis. A: The primary diagnosis is endometriosis, specifically involving the abdominal wall at the site of the mid-rectus muscle. Differential diagnoses such as post-surgical scar tissue or other abdominal pathologies were considered but ruled out by imaging and pathology. P: The management plan includes surgical excision of the endometriotic lesion and reinforcement of the area with mesh to alleviate pain. Post-operative follow-up is scheduled for regular check-ups every two months to monitor recovery and ensure no recurrence of the disease.

Can you tell me when this pain started and what might have caused it? Patient: Yeah, the pain started when I tried to pick up some heavy luggage two years ago. Doctor: Have you been taking any medications or tried any home remedies for the pain? Patient: Yes, I have been taking over-the-counter pain medication and using a hot water bottle on the painful area. It provided some symptomatic relief. Doctor: How long have you been using the hot water bottle, and do you sleep with it? Patient: I've been using the hot water bottle for the past few months, and I used to sleep with it underneath my body. Doctor: Have you noticed any skin changes on the area where you apply the hot water bottle? Patient: Yes, actually. I developed erythema ab igne, and it started to itch. Over the next few months, the area developed hyperpigmentation. Doctor: Thank you for the information. We will need to investigate this further with x-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to better understand what's going on with your back. *After tests* The MRI revealed L4-L5 and L5-S1 disc bulges in your spine. Patient: What does that mean, and how can it be treated? Doctor: We can treat the disc bulges with a transforaminal nerve block (TFNB) injection, which should provide reasonable relief. However, please be aware that the lumbar spine pathology may require surgery later in your life. Patient: Okay, I understand. What about the skin issue? Doctor: I advise you to stop using the hot water bottle immediately. I will refer you to a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment of the erythema ab igne and hyperpigmentation. Patient: Alright, thank you for your help, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Take care!

The patient has been using over-the-counter pain medication and a hot water bottle for symptomatic relief. Recently, the patient developed erythema ab igne with itching and hyperpigmentation due to the hot water bottle application. O: Physical examination was not detailed. MRI findings revealed L4-L5 and L5-S1 disc bulges. The patient has visible skin changes consistent with erythema ab igne and subsequent hyperpigmentation in the area where the hot water bottle was applied. A: The primary diagnosis is lumbar disc bulges at L4-L5 and L5-S1, likely contributing to the patient's chronic lower back pain. A secondary diagnosis of erythema ab igne with hyperpigmentation due to prolonged heat exposure from a hot water bottle is also noted. The lumbar spine pathology may potentially require surgical intervention in the future. P: The management plan includes a transforaminal nerve block (TFNB) injection to address the lumbar disc bulges. The patient is advised to cease using the hot water bottle immediately to prevent further skin damage. A referral to a dermatologist is made for further evaluation and treatment of the skin condition. The patient is encouraged to follow up for reassessment of back pain and to discuss any new or persisting symptoms. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented with a 6-month history of rectal bleeding, passage of mucus, and a change in bowel habit to more frequent stools. Have you experienced any abdominal pains or weight loss during this time? Patient: No, I haven't had any abdominal pains, and my weight has been maintained. Doctor: I understand that you were born with bladder exstrophy and had multiple surgeries, including a cystectomy with ileal conduit formation at 5 years of age. Have you had any other major health issues? Patient: No, but I have suffered from recurrent urinary tract infections since childhood. Doctor: Okay, it's good to know that you have no other major co-morbidities, risk factors for colorectal malignancy, and no family history of colorectal disease. We performed a colonoscopy and found two large sessile polyps in your sigmoid colon, each approximately 3 cm in size. They exhibited a type IV pit pattern with areas of irregularity, suggesting focally advanced disease. Patient: What does that mean, exactly? Doctor: The histological examination confirmed that both polyps were adenomas, which are benign tumors, with both low and high grade dysplasia. However, there was no submucosal invasion. We also found atypical mucosa around a diverticulum-like structure, but it wasn't adenomatous. Patient: And what about the rest of the colonoscopy? Doctor: The remainder of the colonoscopy was unremarkable, with no other evidence of diverticular disease or polyps elsewhere. Now, we considered endoscopic resection as a therapeutic option, but due to the characteristics of the polyps and difficult endoscopic access, we decided that surgery was a better option. Patient: I see. What about the imaging? Doctor: Radiological imaging initially raised the possibility of invasive disease due to sigmoid thickening. You then underwent a high anterior resection, and we chose an open approach because of suspected intra-abdominal adhesions following your extensive pelvic surgery. Patient: And what about the end colostomy? Doctor: At your pre-operative request, we formed an end colostomy. During the laparotomy, we found that your right fallopian tube was adherent to the sigmoid colon, and a blind ending tube emerged from the anti-mesenteric border of the colon. We marked this for pathological identification. Patient: So, how did everything go? Doctor: Your recovery went smoothly, and your quality of life following surgery is good. I understand that your wish to have a permanent colostomy stemmed from your medical history. Patient: Yes, that's correct. I'm glad everything went well. Doctor: We'll continue to monitor your progress and provide any necessary follow-up care. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to reach out. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and care. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of bladder exstrophy and multiple surgeries including cystectomy with ileal conduit formation, presents with a 6-month history of rectal bleeding, passage of mucus, and increased frequency of stools. The patient denies abdominal pain or weight loss and reports recurrent urinary tract infections since childhood. No family history of colorectal disease or other major comorbidities noted. O: Physical examination was unremarkable. Colonoscopy revealed two large sessile polyps in the sigmoid colon, approximately 3 cm each, with a type IV pit pattern and areas of irregularity but no submucosal invasion. Histology confirmed adenomas with both low and high-grade dysplasia. Radiological imaging suggested sigmoid thickening, raising concerns for invasive disease. High anterior resection surgery was performed, and an end colostomy was formed at the patient's request. No complications noted during recovery. A: Primary diagnosis is adenomatous polyps with high-grade dysplasia in the sigmoid colon. Differential diagnosis initially included invasive colorectal cancer due to imaging findings, but this was ruled out with surgical intervention and histological examination. The patient's history of bladder exstrophy and multiple abdominal surgeries contributed to the decision for surgical management due to anticipated intra-abdominal adhesions. P: The patient underwent successful high anterior resection with end colostomy formation. Follow-up care will include regular monitoring of colostomy function and surveillance colonoscopy to assess for recurrence of polyps or new polyp formation. The patient will be educated on signs of complications such as infection or obstruction and advised on lifestyle adjustments to manage the colostomy. Further consultations with a gastroenterologist and a urologist are recommended to manage recurrent urinary tract infections and monitor overall urinary health. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I wanted to discuss your past medical history and recent symptoms with you. You've had a tumor in the past, correct? Patient: Yes, I had a neuroendocrine tumor in my left femur. Doctor: When did you first notice the symptoms that brought you in today? Patient: I've been dealing with progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema recently. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Now, I remember that you had a mass on your left femur, and the biopsy revealed it was a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of unknown primary. You underwent surgical resection, above-knee amputation, and adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide, as well as radiation therapy, right? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Great. Your routine surveillance imaging showed no evidence of malignancy, and you've been in clinical remission for the last two years. The imaging included computed tomographic scans and magnetic resonance imaging with contrast at three-month intervals for the first year followed by six-month intervals. Now, let's discuss your recent physical exam results. Your blood pressure was 119/76 mmHg, heart rate was 104 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and your jugular venous pressure was elevated. We also found a Grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border and rales at the lung bases. Did you experience any discomfort during the exam? Patient: No, I didn't feel any discomfort. Doctor: Alright. Your chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions. We performed a transthoracic echocardiogram and found a large mass measuring 8.10 x 6.54 cm within the right ventricle, causing right ventricular outflow obstruction. Your left ventricular ejection fraction was 60-65%. We also conducted a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, which confirmed the mass extending from the right ventricular free wall with compression of the left ventricle and a dilated right atrium. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We further examined the situation with a positron emission tomographic/computed tomographic scan, which showed increased standardized uptake value activity of 9.3 in the right ventricular mass. The cardiac biopsy of the right ventricular mass was consistent with a metastatic neuroendocrine tumor. The tumor cells were negative for synaptophysin and chromogranin A but positive for CDX2, a marker for neuroendocrine tumor of unknown primary. Patient: So, what does this mean for me? Doctor: This means that the tumor is causing impairment in the right ventricular filling and has led to congestive heart failure, or CHF. To address this, we're going to start you on chemotherapy with doxorubicin and another medication. We'll closely monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help and support you through this. [/INST] S: The patient reports progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. He has a history of a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma in the left femur, treated with surgical resection, above-knee amputation, chemotherapy (cisplatin and etoposide), and radiation therapy. He has been in clinical remission for two years. O: Physical examination shows blood pressure 119/76 mmHg, heart rate 104 bpm, respiratory rate 22 bpm, elevated jugular venous pressure, a Grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border, and rales at lung bases. Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a large mass (8.10 x 6.54 cm) in the right ventricle causing outflow obstruction, with left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-65%. Cardiac MRI confirmed mass extension and right atrial dilation. PET/CT scan showed increased SUV of 9.3 in the right ventricular mass. Cardiac biopsy indicated metastatic neuroendocrine tumor, negative for synaptophysin and chromogranin A, positive for CDX2. A: Primary diagnosis is metastatic neuroendocrine tumor causing right ventricular outflow obstruction and congestive heart failure. Differential diagnosis could include primary cardiac tumors or other metastatic diseases, but biopsy results confirm neuroendocrine origin. P: Initiate chemotherapy with doxorubicin and monitor response. Regular follow-up with cardiac imaging to assess tumor response and cardiac function. Manage symptoms of CHF with appropriate medications and monitor for potential chemotherapy side effects. Provide patient education on symptoms of worsening heart failure and when to seek immediate care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of synthetic cannabinoid use. What brings you to the emergency department today? Patient: Yeah, I've been using synthetic cannabinoids for about five years. Lately, I've been having some strange symptoms like peeing blood and nosebleeds. Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any other unusual symptoms? Patient: Hmm, now that you mention it, I've got a red eye too. Doctor: Okay, let's do a physical examination to check for any other symptoms. Your vital signs are stable, which is good. I can see a right conjunctival hemorrhage in your eye, active epistaxis in your left nostril, and blood-tinged urine. We'll need to do some laboratory tests to understand what's causing these symptoms. Patient: Alright, doc. *After receiving the test results* Doctor: Your lab results are back. Your prothrombin time (PT) is greater than 106 seconds, and your partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is 79.5 seconds. Your international normalized ratio (INR) is not determinable. These results indicate a problem with your blood clotting. Patient: Oh no, what could be causing that? Doctor: Have you been taking any substances or medications that might affect your blood clotting? Patient: Well, I've been adding rodenticides to my synthetic cannabinoids to make them feel stronger. Doctor: That's likely the cause of your coagulopathy. We'll need to admit you to the hospital for monitoring and management of blood loss in the setting of an acute chemical-induced coagulopathy. Patient: Okay, so what's the treatment? Doctor: We'll start with an initial dose of intravenous vitamin K1 50 mg, and I'll notify the poison control center. Over the next two days, you'll receive two doses of oral vitamin K1 50 mg until your PT normalizes. Patient: Got it, thanks doc. I hope this works. Doctor: It's important to monitor your symptoms and follow the treatment plan we've discussed. In the future, please avoid adding dangerous substances to your synthetic cannabinoids. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to reach out. Patient: Yeah, I understand. I'll be more careful from now on. Thanks for your help, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, a long-term user of synthetic cannabinoids, presents with hematuria, epistaxis, and right conjunctival hemorrhage. He reports adding rodenticides to his synthetic cannabinoids to enhance their effects. O: Physical examination shows stable vital signs, right conjunctival hemorrhage, active epistaxis from the left nostril, and blood-tinged urine. Laboratory tests reveal a prothrombin time (PT) >106 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 79.5 seconds, and an undeterminable international normalized ratio (INR), indicating severe coagulopathy. A: The primary diagnosis is acute chemical-induced coagulopathy due to ingestion of rodenticides mixed with synthetic cannabinoids. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of acquired coagulopathy such as liver disease or disseminated intravascular coagulation, but the patient's history of adding rodenticides points to poisoning. P: Immediate hospital admission for monitoring and management of acute chemical-induced coagulopathy. Treatment includes an initial dose of intravenous vitamin K1 50 mg, followed by two doses of oral vitamin K1 50 mg over the next two days. Coordination with the poison control center is essential. The patient is advised to avoid adding harmful substances to drugs and to contact healthcare providers if symptoms persist or worsen. Follow-up to monitor PT and ensure normalization of coagulation parameters is necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I understand you've been experiencing left hip and knee pain along with limping for the past three weeks. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. It's been really painful. Doctor: I see. Have you had any fever or recent trauma that could be related to your symptoms? Patient: No, I haven't had any fever or injuries lately. Doctor: Alright. Let's conduct a physical examination to assess your range of movement. Can you try to move your hip in different directions, like flexing and rotating it? Patient: (tries to move hip) Hmm, it hurts a lot when I try to flex my hip or do internal and external rotation. Doctor: I understand. Given your symptoms, I'd like to perform a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to get a better understanding of your condition. This will involve using a high-frequency probe to take a look at your hip area. Patient: Okay, if that helps figure out what's wrong. Doctor: (performs POCUS) I compared the ultrasound of your left hip with the right side, and I suspect you might have a certain condition. To manage your pain, I recommend expedited immobilization and pain control. Patient: Oh, okay. What's the next step then? Doctor: We need to confirm the diagnosis with a pelvic radiograph. This will give us a clear image of your hip and surrounding structures. Patient: Alright, let's do that. (After the radiograph) Doctor: The pelvic radiograph has confirmed the diagnosis. Now that we know what's causing your hip and knee pain, we can discuss the appropriate treatment plan. Patient: That's good to know. I'm glad we figured it out. [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing left hip and knee pain accompanied by limping for the past three weeks. The patient denies any recent trauma or fever. Pain increases with flexion and internal and external rotation of the hip. O: Physical examination revealed limited range of motion in the left hip due to pain. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) of the left hip showed abnormalities when compared to the right side. Pelvic radiograph confirmed the diagnosis, indicating structural changes in the hip and surrounding areas. A: The primary diagnosis is a hip-related condition, likely involving joint or soft tissue pathology, as indicated by imaging studies and symptomatology. Differential diagnoses could include osteoarthritis, tendinitis, or a minor fracture, although no recent trauma was reported. P: The management plan includes expedited immobilization and pain control. A follow-up with an orthopedic specialist is recommended for further evaluation and management. Patient education on avoiding activities that exacerbate pain and the importance of adherence to the prescribed treatment plan is crucial.

Patient: Sure, I was diagnosed with esophageal cancer and had an operation more than 2 years ago. Doctor: I see. Let's discuss your physical examinations when you were admitted. Your body temperature was 36.3 °C, pulse rate 92 beats/min, breathing 22 times/min, and blood pressure 135/80 mmHg. There was no palpable enlargement of bilateral neck and supraclavicular lymph nodes, and your trachea was in the middle. Your pectoral symmetry was fine, and there were visible scars at your right chest. Your percussion sound at double lung was clear, auscultation of coarse breath sound, no dry and wet rales, and regular rhythm. There was no pain in the kidney area, negative for shifting dullness, and bowel sounds of 3 times/min. Your admission diagnosis was esophageal cancer after operation and hypertension. Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: We performed several examinations to determine the source of your hematemesis. A painless gastroscopy was carried out, but no obvious abnormalities were observed. Then, a painless bronchoscopic examination was done, which revealed posterior basal segment of left lower lobe hemorrhage. Brushing pathology indicated no obvious tumor cells. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: Your thoracic and abdominal enhanced computed tomography scan showed that you had esophageal surgery, bronchitis, emphysema, middle lobe of right lung nodules, right upper lobe and left lower lobe interstitial lesions, and the lower lobe of the left lung inflammation. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We treated you with medicine, specifically 3 g of cefoperazone/sulbactam twice a day for 6 days, and therapy of anticancer, anti-inflammatory, rehydration, and hemostasis. After six days of treatment, your symptoms improved, and you were discharged from the hospital. Patient: Yes, I remember feeling better after the treatment. Doctor: During your painless bronchoscopic examination, we also collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and the cell number was over 104 cfu/ml. Patient: Got it. Doctor: As a follow-up, please continue to monitor your symptoms and regularly visit your healthcare provider to ensure proper management of your esophageal cancer and pulmonary inflammation. If you notice any changes or new symptoms, please don't hesitate to reach out. Patient: Alright, thank you for the information and guidance. I'll make sure to keep an eye on my health.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith from the Institutional Review Board. Your wife has been admitted to our Department of Acute Critical Care Medicine. She was found unconscious by you after ingesting an unknown amount of boric acid, mirtazapine, and sennosides. Is that correct? Husband: Yes, that's correct. She has a history of depression, and I found her in that state. Doctor: Upon her arrival, her vital signs were quite concerning. Her blood pressure was 45/13 mmHg, heart rate at 190 beats per minute, and a body temperature of 37.0 °C. We also noticed she had systemic diffuse erythema. Did you notice any other symptoms before she was transported here? Husband: No, there were no other physical findings that I noticed. Doctor: We performed an Electrocardiography (ECG) which showed atrial fibrillation tachycardia. To stabilize her, we had to perform tracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation. A cardiac echocardiogram depicted diffuse hypokinesis of wall motion with an ejection fraction of 20%. Chest roentgenography revealed no significant findings. Husband: What about her brain condition? Doctor: We performed a whole-body computed tomography to evaluate her brain condition, residual drugs in her stomach, and any accompanying lesions. The scan indicated bilateral dorsal lung consolidation, which suggests aspiration. We also conducted an arterial blood gas analysis, cell blood count, and a biochemical study. Husband: What happened next? Doctor: Unfortunately, she exhibited pulseless electrical activity. We managed to obtain spontaneous circulation through advanced life support, but she experienced repeated episodes of pulseless electrical activity. Due to her unstable circulation, we had to perform percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass. Husband: Was there any issue with her heart? Doctor: We conducted an emergency coronary angiogram which came out negative. She was then admitted to the intensive care unit. Due to acute kidney injury with anuria, we initiated continuous hemodialysis filtration. Husband: How is she now? Doctor: Currently, she remains in a deep coma state without sedation. On the second hospital day, her cardiac motion ceased on the echocardiogram, but her atrial fibrillation rhythm continued. Husband: What are the next steps for her treatment? Doctor: As you strongly wish to continue the treatments, we will do so until cardiac standstill. We'll continue monitoring her condition closely and keep you informed of any changes. [/INST] S: The patient, a female with a history of depression, was found unconscious by her husband after ingesting an unknown amount of boric acid, mirtazapine, and sennosides. No additional symptoms were noted by the husband prior to hospital admission. O: Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were critical with a blood pressure of 45/13 mmHg, heart rate of 190 bpm, and body temperature of 37.0 °C. She exhibited systemic diffuse erythema and atrial fibrillation tachycardia on ECG. Tracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation was performed. A cardiac echocardiogram showed diffuse hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 20%. Chest roentgenography was unremarkable. Whole-body CT scan indicated bilateral dorsal lung consolidation and arterial blood gas analysis, cell blood count, and biochemical study were conducted. The patient experienced repeated episodes of pulseless electrical activity, requiring advanced life support and percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass. An emergency coronary angiogram was negative. Continuous hemodialysis filtration was initiated due to acute kidney injury with anuria. The patient remains in a deep coma without sedation, with ceased cardiac motion on echocardiogram but continued atrial fibrillation rhythm. A: The primary diagnosis is acute poisoning due to ingestion of boric acid, mirtazapine, and sennosides, complicated by acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Differential diagnoses include other causes of acute altered mental status and cardiac dysfunction. The prognosis is guarded given the severe multi-organ involvement and ongoing coma state. P: The treatment plan includes continued intensive care monitoring with mechanical ventilation, continuous hemodialysis filtration, and management of cardiac arrhythmias. The patient's condition will be closely monitored for any changes, and treatments will continue as per the husband's wishes until cardiac standstill. Regular updates will be provided to the family to keep them informed of her status. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you're a 30-year-old Brazilian male who was brought to our ED due to agitation. You were arrested for suspected internal concealment of drugs, also known as body packing, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. I was arrested by Swiss authorities. Doctor: We performed an abdominal CT scan about 12 hours ago and confirmed that you are indeed carrying drug packets in your body (Fig. ). You seemed asymptomatic during that visit. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Well, I admitted to carrying cocaine-containing body packets. I also reported using marijuana and cocaine recreationally. And, um, I'm transsexual, so I have breast implants. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Your past medical history is unknown to us. Did you have any consultation at the ED? Patient: No, I didn't have a consultation. I think the standard operating procedure is to just do a CT scan. Doctor: That's correct. During your second visit, you presented with psychomotor agitation, mydriasis, and tachycardia. Your heart rate was 116 bpm, blood pressure 116/68 mmHg, respiratory rate 40/min, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry 99% on ambient air, and your temperature was 38.0° Celsius. Have you noticed any changes in your mental status? Patient: I don't know, I feel really agitated and it's been impossible to communicate with anyone because of the language barrier. Doctor: I understand. Your physical examination of the heart, lungs, and abdomen showed no pathologies. The neurological examination revealed symmetrical spontaneous movement of all extremities and symmetrical gaze to both sides prompted by speech or touch. Your Glasgow coma scale was 11. We also performed an electrocardiogram and it showed sinus tachycardia without signs of ischemia.  Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: Based on our knowledge of the ingested body packets, we first suspected cocaine intoxication due to package rupture. We treated you with repeated doses of intravenous midazolam and performed an emergency abdominal CT scan to guide potential emergency surgical decontamination. The CT scan showed 60-70 packets in your gastrointestinal tract without signs of gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation.  Patient: Oh, wow. That's a lot of packets. Doctor: Yes, it is. Your laboratory results showed an increased C-reactive protein (CRP) level at 231 mg/l (normal is less than 5 mg/l) and an increased creatinine level at 181 mcmol/l (normal range is 62-106 mcmol/l). We will continue to monitor your condition and provide necessary treatment. Please do not hesitate to inform us if you experience any changes in your symptoms. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient is a 30-year-old Brazilian male, transsexual with breast implants, who was arrested for suspected internal concealment of drugs and brought to the ED due to agitation. He admitted to carrying cocaine-containing body packets and using marijuana and cocaine recreationally. He presented with psychomotor agitation and expressed difficulty in communication due to a language barrier. No past medical history was provided. O: Vital signs recorded: heart rate 116 bpm, blood pressure 116/68 mmHg, respiratory rate 40/min, oxygen saturation 99% on ambient air, temperature 38.0° Celsius. Physical examination showed no abnormalities in the heart, lungs, and abdomen. Neurological examination revealed a Glasgow coma scale of 11, with symmetrical spontaneous movement and gaze.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've been admitted to our hospital with a 3-day history of acute abdominal pain. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've been experiencing some really bad pain in my stomach for the past few days.  Doctor: I understand. Our physical examination revealed right upper quadrant pain and normal bowel sounds. We also found Murphy's sign to be positive. However, your vital signs are within the normal range. We performed an abdominal ultrasonography, which showed an enlarged gallbladder with surrounding tissue inflammation.  Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.  Doctor: We also checked your blood biochemistry, which was essentially normal. Your C-reactive protein level was 1.9 mg/dL, and total bilirubin level was 1.4 mg/dL. An enhanced computed tomography examination revealed an incarcerated gallstone and an enlarged gallbladder.  Patient: Hmm, so what does that mean for me? Doctor: We performed a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, which demonstrated the root of the cystic duct. The middle portion of the cystic duct was unclear, though. With the preoperative diagnosis of grade II acute gangrenous cholecystitis, we planned a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) to remove your gallbladder. Patient: Alright, tell me more about the surgery. Doctor: We inserted the first port into your umbilicus and observed an enlarged and reddish gallbladder. It was swollen, but we did not detect torsion intraoperatively. The second port was placed in the epigastric area, while others were at the right hypochondriac and right lumbar regions. Your gallbladder was attached to the left side of the hepatic round ligament.  Patient: So how did it go? Doctor: Severe inflammation and the narrow working space between the epigastric port and the gallbladder made it difficult to dissect Calot's triangle. However, we were able to resect the cystic duct and the cystic artery after confirming the critical view of safety. Due to the severe inflammation, we performed a subtotal cholecystectomy. The operation took 178 minutes, and there was some intraoperative blood loss. Patient: I see. What's next for me? Doctor: Now that the surgery is complete, we will closely monitor your recovery and provide any necessary post-operative care. It's important to follow the instructions we give you to ensure proper healing and prevent complications. We'll also schedule follow-up appointments to check your progress. Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient reported a 3-day history of severe abdominal pain, specifically in the stomach area. O: Physical examination showed right upper quadrant pain with a positive Murphy's sign and normal bowel sounds. Vital signs were within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed an enlarged gallbladder with surrounding tissue inflammation. Blood biochemistry was normal with a C-reactive protein level of 1.9 mg/dL (normal range: 0-0.5 mg/dL) and total bilirubin level of 1.4 mg/dL (normal range: 0.3-1.2 mg/dL). Enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography indicated an incarcerated gallstone and unclear middle portion of the cystic duct. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed, revealing severe inflammation and an enlarged, reddish gallbladder without torsion. The surgery involved resection of the cystic duct and artery, with a subtotal cholecystectomy completed due to severe inflammation. The operation lasted 178 minutes with noted intraoperative blood loss. A: The primary diagnosis is grade II acute gangrenous cholecystitis, confirmed by imaging and intraoperative findings. The differential diagnosis could include other causes of acute abdominal pain such as appendicitis or peptic ulcer disease, but these were ruled out based on imaging and clinical presentation. P: Post-operative management includes close monitoring of the patient's recovery and providing necessary care to prevent complications. The patient will be educated on post-operative care instructions and scheduled for follow-up appointments to monitor progress. Compliance with post-operative guidelines and attendance at follow-up visits are crucial for successful recovery. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I was hospitalized a while back because of these painful skin ulcers I had, and I'm not sure what's going on with them. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about the ulcers? Patient: They're in the mammary region and have these red and purplish edges. They started about 6 months ago and have rapidly developed from pustular lesions. Doctor: Oh, I understand. Have you tried any treatments? Patient: Yes, I've tried antiseptic and antibiotic therapies, but they didn't help. Doctor: Alright, let me check your medical records. It seems a skin biopsy was done, and it showed a dermal-hypodermal neutrophilic infiltrate, suggesting PG. The laboratory work-up ruled out any underlying inflammatory condition. You were given pulse-therapy with intravenous methylprednisolone 125 mg daily for 5 consecutive days, and there was clinical improvement. You were also prescribed prednisone at tapering dosages in combination with cyclosporine 300 mg daily, which led to progressive healing of the lesions. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: During your hospitalization, a chest computerized tomography revealed a multinodular goiter. Neck ultrasound showed a 12.4 mm solid hypoechoic nodule in the upper pole of the left thyroid lobe and an 8.5 mm hypoechoic nodule in the lower pole of the same lobe. A fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the dominant nodule was performed, and the cytological exam resulted in Tir4 category, which is ""suspicious for thyroid carcinoma."" You underwent a total thyroidectomy, and the histological examination was consistent with multicentric classical PTC, with focal extension to extra-thyroidal soft tissues and surgical resection margins. The histopathologic stadium was pT3(m)Nx according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM VII Edition Staging System. Is that all correct? Patient: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: After the surgery, you received radioactive iodine ablation treatment with 3700 MBq under human recombinant α-thyrotropin stimulation (Thyrogen®). The post-treatment Whole Body Scan showed no uptake outside the thyroid bed, and the stimulated Tg serum value was 2.6 ng/ml. These findings suggest that the treatment has been effective. Patient: Oh, that's good news! Doctor: Yes, it is. Now, it's essential to monitor your progress and follow up with your healthcare team regularly. Make sure to report any new symptoms or concerns promptly. Patient: Okay, I'll do that. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. [/INST] S: The patient reports having painful skin ulcers in the mammary region with red and purplish edges, which started about 6 months ago and developed from pustular lesions. The patient has a history of hospitalization for these ulcers and has tried antiseptic and antibiotic therapies without success. O: Medical records indicate a skin biopsy showing dermal-hypodermal neutrophilic infiltrate, suggestive of Pyoderma Gangrenosum (PG). Previous treatments included pulse-therapy with intravenous methylprednisolone 125 mg daily for 5 days and a combination of prednisone at tapering dosages with cyclosporine 300 mg daily, resulting in clinical improvement. Additionally, a chest CT and neck ultrasound revealed a multinodular goiter with suspicious nodules in the thyroid. Fine-needle aspiration categorized as Tir4, suspicious for thyroid carcinoma. Total thyroidectomy confirmed multicentric classical Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC) with focal extension to extra-thyroidal soft tissues. Post-surgical treatment included radioactive iodine ablation with 3700 MBq under Thyrogen® stimulation, showing no uptake outside the thyroid bed and a stimulated Tg serum value of 2.6 ng/ml. A: The primary diagnosis is Pyoderma Gangrenosum with a secondary diagnosis of multicentric classical Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (pT3(m)Nx). The patient has responded well to the treatment for both conditions, with no evidence of metastatic disease or recurrence of thyroid cancer post-treatment. P: Continue monitoring the healing of the skin ulcers and manage any flare-ups of PG with appropriate immunosuppressive therapy. Regular follow-up is necessary to monitor thyroid function and detect any recurrence of thyroid cancer. The patient should maintain regular appointments with both dermatology and endocrinology, and report any new symptoms or concerns immediately. Further education on the signs of PG flare-ups and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction should be provided to ensure prompt reporting and management. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me your past medical history? Patient: I have hypertension, preeclampsia, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I'm on buspirone for my anxiety and bipolar disorder. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. What brings you to the emergency department today? Patient: Well, I've been having multiple complaints, but my main issue is this persistent headache that started a week ago. Doctor: Can you tell me more about this headache? Did anything else happen along with it? Patient: Yeah, it began in the evening with some nausea and vomiting. I went to urgent care the next day and got some medications. I felt better for about two days, but then the symptoms came back. Doctor: I see. Did you have any tests done for your headache? Patient: Yes, I went to another hospital and had a computed tomography scan of my head and a lumbar puncture, but both came back negative. Doctor: Were you admitted to the hospital for any reason? Patient: I was admitted because of an elevated troponin level. I had a cardiac catheterization, but they didn't do any interventions. They found a 60% blockage in a single vessel. Doctor: When were you discharged from the hospital? Patient: Just a day ago, but my headache is still bothering me. It feels like the headache I had with my preeclampsia, like a grip around my entire head. Doctor: Let's check your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 172/92 mmHg, pulse 81, respiratory rate 18, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. I'll also perform a physical exam. You seem to be in pain, but overall, you don't look too sick. Your heart and lung sounds are normal, and your neurological exam shows no numbness, weakness, or abnormalities with coordination, gait, or cranial nerves. Patient: That's good to hear, I guess. Doctor: We'll get a chest plain film, initial lab, and an electrocardiogram done. In the meantime, we'll give you one liter of intravenous fluids, metoclopramide intravenous, and ketorolac intravenous for your headache. (Doctor returns after a while) Doctor: Your test results were normal, but you still seem uncomfortable. We'll put you in the observation unit and order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your brain to find out more. Patient: Okay, thank you. (After the MRI results) Doctor: Your MRI shows three punctate regions of focal restricted diffusion in the left middle frontal gyrus, right parietal lobe, and left temporal lobe. These appear consistent with acute infarcts. I'm going to consult with neurology to determine the best course of action. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I just want to find out what's causing this headache and get some relief. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of hypertension, preeclampsia, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, presents with a chief complaint of a persistent headache that started a week ago, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The headache was initially managed at urgent care with temporary relief, but symptoms recurred. The patient describes the headache as similar to previous preeclampsia experiences, characterized as a grip around the entire head. O: Vital signs show elevated blood pressure at 172/92 mmHg, pulse 81, respiratory rate 18, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Previous hospitalization noted elevated troponin and a 60% blockage in a single vessel, treated without intervention. Recent imaging includes a negative computed tomography scan and lumbar puncture. Current examination reveals normal heart and lung sounds, and neurological exam shows no abnormalities. Recent MRI indicates three punctate regions of focal restricted diffusion in the left middle frontal gyrus, right parietal lobe, and left temporal lobe, suggestive of acute infarcts. A: Primary diagnosis of acute cerebral infarcts with differential diagnoses including migraine and hypertensive encephalopathy. The patient's history of preeclampsia and current symptoms raise concerns for hypertensive complications affecting cerebral vasculature. P: Management will include admission to the observation unit for close monitoring of neurological status and blood pressure. Immediate consultation with neurology for further evaluation and management of acute infarcts. Initiate antihypertensive therapy to target blood pressure control and prevent further vascular damage.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see from your past medical history that you have diabetes and thyroid disease. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been losing some weight lately and wanted to have a consultation about it. Doctor: Sure, let's discuss your weight loss. Have you had any recent surgeries or procedures done? Patient: No, there's no surgical history. But I did have an endoscopy recently. Doctor: I see. Did you experience any symptoms before the endoscopy? Patient: The only subjective finding was mild occasional gastrointestinal reflux disease, or GERD. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. I have your records here, and it shows that you underwent a pre-operative esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD). During the EGD, a 3 cm mass was found along the anterior aspect of your gastric body, near the incisura angularis. The biopsy taken at that time was indeterminate, so you were referred to gastroenterology for a repeat EGD and an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).  Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: The subsequent EGD re-demonstrated the 3 cm mass near the incisura. It had a positive pillow sign, which means the surface of the lesion pillowed when prodded. Stack biopsies were obtained, and fat was found within the biopsy, which is consistent with a lipoma. The EUS revealed a 3.3 x 1.6 cm relatively echogenic mass in the area of the gastric lesion, also consistent with a lipoma. The pathology report confirmed it as a submucosal lipoma. An ancillary H. pylori biopsy was negative. Patient: So it's just a lipoma then? Doctor: Yes, that's correct. A CT scan was performed to re-demonstrate the lesion and confirmed a lack of an extra-gastric component. Due to the lipoma's location, resection was essential to prevent obstructive symptoms following a sleeve gastrectomy. Patient: What's the next step? Doctor: You underwent a simultaneous laparoscopic vertical gastrectomy, gastric lipoma excision, EGD, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A longitudinal gastrotomy was made on the greater curvature. Exposure was achieved using retraction sutures. Patient: How did the procedure go? Doctor: We used electrocautery to open the mucosa overlying the lipoma. Blunt and ultrasonic dissection were then employed to mobilize the lipoma. We identified the vascular pedicle and divided it using the harmonic scalpel. Finally, a primary closure of the mucosa and greater curvature was performed. Patient: I'm glad it was taken care of. Is there anything I should be doing for follow-up care? Doctor: We will schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor your progress and ensure that there are no complications. In the meantime, follow a balanced diet and take any prescribed medications as directed. If you experience any concerning symptoms, please contact us immediately. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help with this. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. [/INST] S: Patient reports recent unintentional weight loss. No recent surgeries but underwent an endoscopy due to mild occasional GERD symptoms. No other new symptoms reported. O: Past medical history includes diabetes and thyroid disease. Recent esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) revealed a 3 cm mass in the anterior aspect of the gastric body, near the incisura angularis. Initial biopsy was indeterminate; however, repeat EGD and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) confirmed the mass as a 3.3 x 1.6 cm lipoma. CT scan showed no extra-gastric component. Patient underwent laparoscopic vertical gastrectomy, gastric lipoma excision, EGD, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy with successful excision of the lipoma. A: Primary diagnosis is gastric lipoma. The mass was successfully excised with no complications reported post-operatively. Differential diagnosis initially included other gastric masses, but imaging and biopsy confirmed lipoma. P: Patient to follow a balanced diet and adhere to prescribed medications. Regular follow-up appointments scheduled to monitor post-operative recovery and ensure no complications arise.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that you are gravida 3, para 2, and have been referred to our institution due to a neck mass found on prenatal ultrasonography (US). Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Can you tell me more about the neck mass? When was it discovered? Patient: It was found at 30.6 weeks. The sonogram showed a 10 by 8 cm mass on the right side of my baby's neck. It wasn't present in the scans taken at 14 and 22 weeks. Doctor: I see. Our ultrasound studies also show that the mass is composed of a cystic portion and a solid portion containing blood vessels, and it's growing rapidly. Additionally, we've noticed a significant polyhydramnios with an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 50. This suggests an upper gastrointestinal obstruction and a highly possible airway obstruction as well. Were these findings confirmed by fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)? Patient: Yes, they were. Doctor: Considering the difficulty in establishing a secured airway at birth and the potential complicated resection of the giant tumor after birth, we've referred you to our hospital for consultation. Our maternal fetal team, neonatologist, anesthesiologist, pediatric surgeon, and otolaryngologist have been involved in your case. We understand that you were presented with a guarded prognosis but insisted on continuing the pregnancy with maximal efforts during delivery and the neonatal period. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, we want to do everything we can for our baby. Doctor: In that case, we've planned an EXIT procedure, which provides the best chance to establish a patent airway for your baby. We've informed you about the risks for the mother, including significant hemorrhage from the uterus due to the uterine relaxation necessary to avoid placental separation, and a possible uterine resection in the case of a life-threatening hemorrhage. Are you aware of these risks? Patient: Yes, we understand the risks and are willing to go forward with the procedure. Doctor: Given the risk of an unplanned preterm delivery due to polyhydramnios and uterine contractions, we've scheduled you for a planned cesarean delivery at 34 weeks. We have organized and prepared a multidisciplinary team, including obstetricians, anesthesiologists, neonatologists, otolaryngologists, pediatric surgeons, pulmonologists, and cardiologists, to be ready to perform the EXIT procedure. Do you have any questions or concerns about this plan? Patient: No, we trust your team and appreciate the efforts in helping our baby. Doctor: Thank you for your trust. We'll do everything we can to ensure the best possible outcome for you and your baby. Please follow the instructions given to you by the team and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns along the way. Patient: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your care and support. [/INST] S: The patient is a gravida 3, para 2, referred for a prenatal finding of a neck mass in the fetus, identified at 30.6 weeks gestation. The mass, located on the right side of the fetal neck, measures 10 by 8 cm and was not present in earlier scans at 14 and 22 weeks. The patient reports that fetal MRI confirmed the presence of both cystic and solid components within the mass, along with significant polyhydramnios (AFI 50), suggesting potential upper gastrointestinal and airway obstructions. The patient and her partner are committed to continuing the pregnancy and pursuing maximal intervention efforts. O: Ultrasound and MRI findings confirm a rapidly growing fetal neck mass with cystic and solid components, including vascularization. Significant polyhydramnios is noted with an AFI of 50, raising concerns for gastrointestinal and airway obstruction in the fetus. The patient has been informed of the risks associated with the necessary interventions, including potential significant maternal hemorrhage and the need for uterine resection in case of life-threatening complications. A: The primary diagnosis is a large fetal neck mass with associated polyhydramnios, posing risks of airway and gastrointestinal obstructions. Differential diagnoses could include congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation or teratoma. The prognosis is guarded given the size of the mass and the associated complications. P: The management plan includes a scheduled cesarean delivery at 34 weeks with an EXIT (ex utero intrapartum treatment) procedure to establish a patent airway at birth. A multidisciplinary team comprising obstetricians, anesthesiologists, neonatologists, otolaryngologists, pediatric surgeons, pulmonologists, and cardiologists has been assembled. The patient has been briefed on the significant risks, including maternal hemorrhage and potential uterine resection.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 33-year-old Italian man of Indo-European descent and have been in military service since 2001. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I was admitted to the hospital because I suddenly experienced hearing loss within 24 hours of receiving two vaccines: intramuscular tetanus and diphtheria vaccines, and subcutaneous meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your vaccinations and if you had any previous issues or relevant family history? Patient: Sure. After giving informed consent, I received the meningococcal vaccine in my right arm and the tetanus-diphtheria vaccines in my left arm. Nothing relevant was observed in my family and remote pathological history. Doctor: Okay, and did you complete a questionnaire to exclude any conditions that might be contraindications to the vaccinations? Patient: Yes, I did. The questionnaire excluded various conditions like concomitant intake of other drugs, homeopathic treatments, nutritional supplements, and products based on medicinal plants. It also ruled out a history of adverse reactions to vaccinations, documented allergies, recent positive history of fever, airway disorders, and treatments like antibiotics, NSAIDs, cortisones, aspirin, antimalarial drugs, blood transfusion in the last 6 months, and administration of immunoglobulins. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Now, let's talk about the symptoms you experienced after the vaccinations. Can you describe them? Patient: Within 24 hours after the vaccinations, I started feeling dizziness, nausea, and right hearing loss due to NDD. Doctor: I understand. Did you visit the emergency department for these symptoms? Patient: Yes, I went to the emergency department and they performed an audiometric examination and a tympanogram on me. They diagnosed me with a ""severe right perceptual deficit"". Doctor: I see. And did you receive any treatment or further examinations during your hospitalization? Patient: Yes, I was admitted to the otorhinolaryngology department since the symptoms persisted despite the pharmacological medical treatment. During my stay, they performed many investigations like brain NMR to exclude vascular origin of the hearing loss, as well as other audiometric and otorhinolaryngology examinations. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. And how has your condition been since your discharge from the hospital? Patient: It has been a bit better, but I still have some hearing loss and occasional dizziness. Doctor: Alright. We'll continue to monitor your progress and work on a plan to manage your symptoms. In the meantime, please let me know if you experience any changes or worsening of your condition. [/INST] S: The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of military service, presenting with sudden onset of right-sided hearing loss, dizziness, and nausea within 24 hours post-vaccination with intramuscular tetanus and diphtheria vaccines and subcutaneous meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. He denies any relevant family or personal medical history, allergies, or recent medication use that could contraindicate vaccinations. O: The patient underwent an audiometric examination and tympanogram in the emergency department, which revealed a severe right perceptual deficit. Further investigations, including brain NMR, were conducted to exclude a vascular origin of the hearing loss. Vital signs and other physical examination findings were not provided. A: The primary diagnosis is sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), likely associated with recent vaccinations. Differential diagnoses could include viral infections or autoimmune disorders, but these seem less likely given the temporal relationship with the vaccinations and lack of other symptoms or history. P: The management plan will include monitoring the patient's hearing and symptoms closely. Referral to an otorhinolaryngologist for continued evaluation and management of the hearing loss is recommended. The patient should be advised to avoid further vaccinations until the etiology of the SSNHL is clarified. Education regarding the signs of worsening symptoms and when to seek immediate care should be provided. Follow-up appointments should be scheduled to assess progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, I see you're a previously well 87-year-old Caucasian woman living in a senior assisted care center. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I came to the neurology clinic because I've been experiencing left sided weakness for the past six months. It started with difficulty in walking and using the stairs, and now I'm wheelchair bound. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you noticed any other symptoms, like facial drooping or issues with your leg? Patient: Yes, I have a left facial droop and my left leg seems to drift. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We performed a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on you, and it revealed a large confluent white matter T2-hyperintensity in the right frontal lobe. There was also multifocal nodular enhancement of the left cerebral hemisphere, and foci of enhancement were identified in the cerebellum and leptomeninges.  Patient: Oh, what does that mean? Doctor: The radiologic findings suggest a few probable causes, such as vasculitis, lymphoma, or CNS sarcoidosis. Other possibilities like glial neoplasm, demyelination, and metastases are considered less likely. To get a better understanding, we performed a brain biopsy and analyzed the sample. Patient: What did you find in the biopsy? Doctor: The biopsy showed extensive deposition of amorphous, amyloid-like material in the brain. Congo-red positive staining and apple-green birefringence confirmed the material was indeed amyloid. We also found perivascular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in the resected tissue. Patient: So, what's the diagnosis? Doctor: The initial histologic differential diagnoses include cerebral amyloid angiopathy-inflammatory type (CAA-I) and lymphoma associated amyloidoma. To identify the underlying cause of the amyloid accumulation, we performed additional analyses. Patient: What were the results of those analyses? Doctor: Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopic analysis identified the amyloid as AL λ-type, which means it's not β amyloid or related to hereditary amyloidosis. We also examined the perivascular lymphoid cells further. Patient: What did you find out about those cells? Doctor: The cells demonstrated a lymphoplasmacytic appearance and were positive for CD20 on immunohistochemical analysis. However, they were negative for CD3, CD5, and BCL. Patient: So, what does this all mean for my condition and treatment? Doctor: Based on the findings, we can narrow down the diagnosis and determine the most appropriate treatment plan for you. We will continue to monitor your progress and adjust the treatment as needed. It's important to follow up regularly so we can provide the best care possible. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and explanation.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I was told to come to the gastroenterology office for a follow-up on a duodenal lesion that was found 2 years ago. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me what symptoms you experienced back then? Patient: I had an EGD 2 years ago because of abdominal pain. Doctor: Alright. The EGD showed a 1.2 cm duodenal polypoid lesion in the second portion of the duodenum. The pathology report revealed heterotopic gastric mucosa with benign lobules of gastric glands. You also had chronically active H. pylori gastritis and atrophic gastritis with patchy areas of intestinal metaplasia. Were you instructed to follow up for a repeat endoscopy for surveillance in two years? Patient: Yes, that's why I'm here now. Doctor: Great. Given your history, we performed an upper endoscopy which showed atrophic gastritis, duodenitis, and a single 10 mm polyp in the second portion of the duodenum. We biopsied the duodenal polyp, and the pathology revealed polypoid gastric metaplastic mucosa with focal epithelial atypia, including nuclear enlargement, stratification, nucleoli, and few mitoses. Due to these findings, we referred you for an endoscopic ultrasound to further characterize the lesion and complete resection. Patient: Okay, what happened after the ultrasound? Doctor: The endoscopic ultrasound revealed a 13-mm pedunculated and sessile polyp on the lateral wall opposite to the major papilla in the second portion of the duodenum. We removed the polyp en bloc using a hot snare following a 4-mL saline lift and placed two endoclips for hemostasis. Patient: What did the pathology show after that? Doctor: The pathology revealed a pyloric gland adenoma with predominantly low grade dysplasia and some small areas of focal high grade dysplasia. The slides were read by our in-house pathologist and reviewed by a GI expert pathologist at the University of Michigan. Patient: So, what are the next steps? Doctor: We recommend that you follow up for a surveillance upper endoscopy in 6 months due to the areas of high grade dysplasia found on pathology. It's important not to miss this follow-up appointment. Patient: Alright, I'll make sure to schedule that follow-up. Doctor: Good. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, don't hesitate to contact our office. Take care. Patient: Thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient reported a history of abdominal pain leading to an initial EGD 2 years ago, which identified a duodenal lesion.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've been taking oral cyclophosphamide for your lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma for the past 4 years. How have you been feeling lately? Patient: Well, recently I've been experiencing some leg edema and weight gain.  Doctor: I see. You were referred to the nephrology department as you've developed nephrotic syndrome. We have some laboratory data that shows your kidney function is preserved with a serum creatinine of 0.61 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 73.7 ml/min/1.73m2. However, you do have hypoalbuminemia with a level of 2.2 g/dL. Did you notice any changes in your urine? Patient: No, I haven't noticed any changes. Doctor: Your urinalysis was negative for occult blood, and the urinary total protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) was found to be 9.7 g/gCr. We also tested your serum immunoglobulin levels which showed IgG at 466 mg/dL, IgA at 74 mg/dL, and IgM at 2789 mg/dL. The serum free light-chain levels were kappa-light chain 24.4 mg/L and lambda-light chain 15.8 mg/L, resulting in a kappa-to-lambda serum free light-chain ratio of 1.54. Plasma electrophoresis revealed IgM-kappa monoclonal gammopathy. To further investigate, we performed a renal biopsy.  Patient: What did the biopsy show? Doctor: The renal biopsy specimens contained 12 glomeruli without proliferative features. We observed slight mesangial widening with amorphous deposits. Congo-red staining was positive in the mesangial area, and electron microscopic analysis showed non-branched fibrils, indicating renal amyloidosis.  Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: Renal amyloidosis is a condition where abnormal proteins called amyloid fibrils build up in your kidneys, which can affect their function. The electron microscopic analysis was negative for granular and amorphous deposits on the endothelial aspect of the glomerular basement membrane and outer aspect of the tubular basement membrane.  Patient: What about the immunofluorescence staining? Doctor: The immunofluorescence staining was equally positive for IgM and kappa light-chains. It was negative for linear staining of the tubular basement membrane. The immunostaining for other immunoglobulins, complements, serum amyloid A, transthyretin, and fibrinogen yielded negative results. Based on these findings, you have been diagnosed with IgM-kappa type renal AHL amyloidosis due to your lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Patient: Oh, I see. What do we do now? Doctor: We'll discuss the best course of action to manage the amyloidosis and your lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. This may involve changes to your current treatment plan. It's important that you continue to monitor your symptoms and attend follow-up appointments as needed. We'll work together to ensure the best possible outcome for your health.

Serum immunoglobulin levels showed IgG at 466 mg/dL, IgA at 74 mg/dL, and IgM at 2789 mg/dL, with serum free light-chain levels of kappa-light chain 24.4 mg/L and lambda-light chain 15.8 mg/L, resulting in a kappa-to-lambda serum free light-chain ratio of 1.54. Plasma electrophoresis revealed IgM-kappa monoclonal gammopathy. Renal biopsy indicated renal amyloidosis with Congo-red positive staining in the mesangial area and non-branched fibrils on electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence staining was positive for IgM and kappa light-chains. A: The primary diagnosis is IgM-kappa type renal AHL amyloidosis secondary to lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of nephrotic syndrome and proteinuria, but these are less likely given the biopsy results and immunofluorescence staining. P: The management plan will involve revising the current treatment for lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma to address the newly diagnosed renal amyloidosis. The patient will continue to monitor symptoms and attend regular follow-up appointments to assess the effectiveness of the new treatment regimen and make adjustments as necessary. Education on symptom management and the importance of compliance with the new treatment plan will be provided. Referral to a renal specialist for further management of nephrotic syndrome and amyloidosis is recommended. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you were admitted to the Department of Hematology at the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University on May 6, 2016. What brought you here? Patient: Hi doctor, I've been feeling really pale and tired for about a month now. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about any medical history that you have? Patient: Yeah, I had tuberculous pleurisy about 24 years ago. I'm a farmer by profession. Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that. We performed a hematological analysis on you, and the results showed a white blood cell count of 23.8 × 10^9/L, a hemoglobin level of 64 g/L, and a platelet count of 433 × 10^9/L. We also examined your bone marrow and peripheral blood smears, which identified the proliferation of lymphoblastic cells. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does it mean? Doctor: We conducted a karyotype analysis, which revealed a normal karyotype (46, XX). Immunophenotypic analysis by flow cytometry showed that blast cells accounted for 76.8% and were positive for CD34, CD10, CD19, CD22, and HLA-DR, but negative for cIgM. Based on these findings, you have been diagnosed with common B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patient: Oh no! What's the treatment plan, doctor? Doctor: We started you on a standard induction chemotherapy regimen, which included dexamethasone, vincristine, daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and peg-L-asparaginase. After this treatment, you achieved partial remission, with only 5% of lymphoblasts observed in the bone marrow smear. Patient: That's a relief. What happened next? Doctor: You received a second induction chemotherapy with vincristine, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, cytarabine, and dexamethasone. After this, you were discharged from the hospital on June 18, 2016. Patient: Yeah, I remember that. Doctor: You were admitted to our hospital again on July 22, 2016, for consolidation therapy. A complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 4.1 × 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 82 g/L, and platelet count of 206 × 10^9/L. A bone marrow examination revealed 41% of lymphoblasts, which indicated early relapse. Patient: Oh no, not again. What's the next step? Doctor: We decided to start you on a cycle of CAM (CTX, Ara-c, and 6-MP) to treat the relapse. We'll closely monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I hope this treatment works. [/INST] S: The patient, a farmer, presented with symptoms of paleness and fatigue lasting for about a month. He has a medical history of tuberculous pleurisy 24 years ago.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been feeling really unwell lately. I've had a fever of 102.0 °F, increased sputum production, and purulent conjunctivitis. These symptoms have been gradually getting worse over the past 48 hours. Doctor: I see. Have you been experiencing any difficulty coughing or any changes in your sputum? Patient: Yes, I've had increasing difficulty coughing out my sputum, and it's become brownish and viscous. Doctor: That sounds quite uncomfortable. I understand that you underwent a laryngectomy 10 years ago. Can you tell me more about that? Patient: Sure. I had hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, which was treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy 12 years ago. The cancer came back 2 years later, and I had to have a laryngectomy. I've been cancer-free since then. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Have you been wearing any devices to help with your breathing and speech? Patient: Yes, I've been wearing a heat and moisture exchanger (HME) filter over my stoma, and I use a tracheoesophageal voice prosthesis to speak. Doctor: Okay. Did anything unusual happen recently that might have triggered your current symptoms? Patient: Well, the symptoms started a day after a very cold weather spell with temperatures of 19–31 °F. I had to remove my HME several times for extended periods when I walked outside my home to breathe. Doctor: I see. Aside from your cancer history, do you have any other medical conditions? Patient: Yes, I suffer from paroxysmal hypertension, diverticulitis, and migraines. Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. Have you been vaccinated for the flu or pneumonia recently? Patient: Yes, I got the current Influenza virus vaccine 3 months ago and a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) 2 years ago. Doctor: I appreciate all of the details you've provided. I'd like to perform a physical examination and some tests to figure out what's causing your symptoms.  (After examination and tests) Doctor: Your physical examination revealed bilateral purulent conjunctivitis, and auscultation of your lungs showed coarse rhonchi with no crepitations. There was no lymphadenopathy, and the rest of your physical and neurological examinations were within normal limits. Your chest X-ray was also normal. Patient: So, what's causing my symptoms? Doctor: Your sputum and conjunctival culture showed a heavy growth of beta-lactamase-producing nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), which is susceptible to levofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate.  Patient: How do we treat this infection? Doctor: I will prescribe you a course of levofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate to treat the infection. It's important to take the medication as prescribed and complete the entire course, even if you start feeling better.  Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to follow your instructions. [/INST] S: The patient, a laryngectomy survivor, reports a 48-hour history of worsening symptoms including a fever of 102.0 °F, increased and viscous brownish sputum production, and purulent conjunctivitis. The patient has a history of hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with radiotherapy and subsequent laryngectomy. The patient uses a heat and moisture exchanger (HME) filter and a tracheoesophageal voice prosthesis. Symptoms began following exposure to cold weather and temporary removal of the HME. The patient also has paroxysmal hypertension, diverticulitis, migraines, and is up-to-date with vaccinations including Influenza and PPSV23. O: Physical examination revealed bilateral purulent conjunctivitis and coarse rhonchi in the lungs without crepitations or lymphadenopathy. Neurological and additional physical examinations were normal. Chest X-ray showed no abnormalities. Sputum and conjunctival cultures indicated a heavy growth of beta-lactamase-producing nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), susceptible to levofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate. A: The primary diagnosis is a respiratory and conjunctival infection due to NTHi. Differential diagnoses could include other bacterial or viral infections, considering the patient's complex medical history and recent environmental exposure. The prognosis is good with appropriate antibiotic treatment. P: Prescribe a course of levofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate to address the NTHi infection. Instruct the patient to complete the full course of antibiotics, even if symptoms improve. Advise the patient to keep the HME filter in place, especially during cold weather, to prevent similar occurrences. Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess the patient's condition and ensure resolution of the infection. Educate the patient on signs of potential complications requiring immediate medical attention. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, I see that you have presented with some recent onset visual symptoms. Can you tell me more about what you have been experiencing? Patient: Yes, I've been having trouble with my vision, and I've noticed some changes in my eyesight. Doctor: I see. Based on your examination, you were initially diagnosed with paramacular drusen associated with age-related macular degeneration or AMD. Your best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measured 20/25 in your right eye (OD) and 20/40 in your left eye (OS). These levels have remained stable for the past 2 years, which is good. Do you have any history of smoking, ocular trauma, or inflammation? Patient: I do have a history of smoking, but I haven't experienced any ocular trauma or inflammation. Doctor: Okay, thank you for that information. It is also noted that you have a positive family history, as your brother has been diagnosed with advanced neovascular AMD. During your slit-lamp examination, the anterior segment was found to be within normal limits. The fundus examination revealed healthy optic nerves with no disk pallor and normal retinal vasculature appropriate for your age, without any significant thinning or attenuation. Patient: That's good to know. Doctor: We also observed diffuse yellow flecks in the peripheral macula extending out into the mid-periphery. Clustered, confluent patterns were seen in the temporal macula and arranged radially in the central macula. There was also pigment stippling and mottling around the fovea (A, inset, blue arrowheads). Patient: Hmm, what does that mean? Doctor: These flecks were autofluorescent with dark borders. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) showed a loss of foveal pit contour, inner retinal thickening, and a hyper-reflective inner limiting membrane (ILM) in your left eye. This is consistent with a developing epiretinal membrane. Flecks were visible as hyper-reflective deposits traversing photoreceptor layers, emanating from the RPE (B). Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: The ellipsoid zone (EZ) and external limiting membrane (ELM) layers are disrupted at the position of the flecks (C, red arrowheads). Flecks of sufficient height impinged on the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Patient: What does this mean for my vision? Doctor: Microperimetry (MP-1) testing with a 10-2 visual field pattern showed reduced visual sensitivity and function over the flecked areas, ranging from 10 to 16 dB. Your foveal fixation was found to be stable (BCEA = 1). Patient: So, what are the next steps for me? Doctor: It's important to closely monitor your condition, as it may progress over time. Regular check-ups and following up with any concerns are crucial. If you notice any changes in your vision or symptoms, please reach out to your eye care specialist immediately. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. I will be sure to monitor my vision and reach out if I have any concerns. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care and don't hesitate to contact us if you need any assistance. [/INST] S: The patient reports recent onset visual symptoms and changes in eyesight. The patient has a history of smoking and a positive family history of advanced neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a sibling. No history of ocular trauma or inflammation is reported. O: The patient's best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is 20/25 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye, stable over the past 2 years. Slit-lamp examination shows the anterior segment within normal limits. Fundus examination reveals healthy optic nerves, normal retinal vasculature, diffuse yellow flecks in the peripheral macula, and pigment stippling around the fovea. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) indicates a loss of foveal pit contour, inner retinal thickening, and a hyper-reflective inner limiting membrane in the left eye, suggesting an epiretinal membrane. Microperimetry testing shows reduced visual sensitivity over the flecked areas. A: The patient is diagnosed with paramacular drusen associated with AMD, with developing epiretinal membrane in the left eye. Differential diagnosis includes other causes of macular degeneration and retinal diseases. The prognosis is cautious given the potential for progression of AMD and the impact of the epiretinal membrane on visual function. P: Plan includes regular monitoring of the patient's condition with follow-up appointments to assess any progression or new symptoms. The patient is advised to monitor their vision and report any changes immediately. Smoking cessation is recommended to potentially slow the progression of AMD. Referral to a retinal specialist may be considered if there are significant changes in the patient's condition or if treatment options for the epiretinal membrane are needed. Education on the nature of AMD and its potential impact on vision will be provided to ensure the patient understands the importance of monitoring and treatment compliance. </s>"

I have a history of food allergies, specifically to eggs and peanuts. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any skin problems related to your allergies? Patient: Yes, I have severe eczematous skin lesions that don't go away even with local and systemic steroids. Doctor: Hmm, that sounds quite persistent. Have you had any infections related to these skin issues? Patient: I've had repeated sinopulmonary infections and have been treated in an outpatient setting. I also get recurrent infections with molloscum contagiosum and flat warts on my face, neck, behind my ears, axillary area, and genitalia. Doctor: It seems like you've encountered quite a few issues. Have you experienced any dental problems as well? Patient: Yes, I had dental problems related to malocclusion and retention of primary teeth. I needed dental intervention and also had mucocutaneous candidiasis. Doctor: Were your vaccinations given according to the schedule in Iraq? Patient: Yes, they were. Doctor: When you were 9 years old, did you experience any issues with your jaw or teeth? Patient: I had a slowly growing right jaw mass and toothache. I didn't have any fever, headache, or bone pain. Doctor: Did you take any antibiotics for the jaw mass and toothache? Patient: Yes, I used antibiotics, but the mass continued to increase in size over several months without a change in the overlying skin. Doctor: Upon examination, did you have any itchy skin lesions on your face, scalp, and body as well as genitalia? Patient: Yes, I had those along with a non-tender right jaw swelling. There was also a right submandibular lymph node, about 2.5 cm, and bilateral cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, around 1.5-2 cm. Doctor: How about your oral examination? Did it show any issues with your right mandible? Patient: The oral examination showed a fungating mass related to my right mandible with a bad odor. Doctor: Did you have any other symptoms such as jaundice, fever, café au lait spots, or edema? Patient: No, I didn't have those symptoms. Doctor: Were there any abnormal findings during your chest and abdominal examination? Patient: Yes, there was scattered crepitation and a palpable liver. Doctor: How have your growth parameters been? Are they below the 3rd centile? Patient: Yes, my growth parameters are below the 3rd centile, but my school performance has been good. Doctor: It's good to hear that your school performance has been unaffected. I should also ask, are your parents first cousins from both maternal and paternal sides? Patient: Yes, they are first cousins from both sides. Doctor: Thank you for sharing all this information. We'll take all these factors into account while determining the best course of action for your treatment. [/INST] S: The patient, who has had health issues since age 2, reports a history of severe food allergies to eggs and peanuts, persistent eczematous skin lesions unresponsive to steroids, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, infections with molloscum contagiosum and flat warts, and dental issues including malocclusion and mucocutaneous candidiasis. The patient also describes a slowly growing right jaw mass and toothache without fever, headache, or bone pain, despite antibiotic treatment. Additionally, the patient mentions itchy skin lesions, non-tender right jaw swelling, right submandibular and bilateral cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, a fungating mass on the right mandible with a bad odor, scattered crepitation, and a palpable liver. Growth parameters are below the 3rd centile, but school performance is good. The patient's parents are first cousins. O: Physical examination revealed a right submandibular lymph node approximately 2.5 cm, bilateral cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy around 1.5-2 cm, a fungating mass on the right mandible, scattered crepitation, and a palpable liver. No signs of jaundice, fever, café au lait spots, or edema were noted. A: The patient presents with complex multi-system symptoms suggestive of an underlying immunodeficiency disorder, possibly complicated by a genetic component given the consanguinity of the parents. Differential diagnoses include primary immunodeficiency disorders and chronic granulomatous disease. The persistent growth of the jaw mass despite antibiotic treatment raises concerns for a possible neoplastic process. P: Plan to conduct further diagnostic tests including complete blood count, immunoglobulin levels, and genetic testing to evaluate for primary immunodeficiency disorders. Refer to a pediatric immunologist for specialized care. Schedule an MRI of the jaw to assess the extent of the mass and potential malignancy. Continue monitoring growth parameters and nutritional status. Educate the patient and family about the signs of infection and the importance of prompt treatment.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. What brings you to the emergency department today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I suddenly had trouble breathing while lifting some heavy stuff during farm work. It was really scary. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms, like orthopnea or coughing up pink bubble sputum? Patient: Yes, actually. I've had trouble breathing when lying down, and I've been coughing up this weird pink bubbly stuff. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. I'm going to do a physical examination and check your heart rate and blood pressure, okay? Patient: Sure, go ahead. Doctor: Your heart rate is 103 per minute and your blood pressure is 99/63 mm Hg. I also noticed a 4/6 systolic murmur during the examination. We'll need to do some tests, like an Electrocardiogram and blood test, to get a better understanding of what's going on. Patient: Hmm, alright. Doctor: The Electrocardiogram demonstrated depression of ST segments in multiple leads: I, II, aVL, and V3 to V6. However, your blood test showed no troponin elevation, which is a good sign. We also performed a chest X-ray and detected acute pulmonary congestion. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We also performed an Echocardiogram, which found a prolapsed posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with massive regurgitation. Your ejection fraction is 68%, and your left ventricle is normal sized. Have you had any similar symptoms in the past? Patient: No, this is the first time I've experienced anything like this. Doctor: Based on your symptoms and test results, we've preliminarily diagnosed you with acute left heart failure caused by mitral regurgitation. We'll need to schedule you for valve repair surgery. Patient: Okay, I understand. Doctor: Before the surgery, we performed a routine coronary angiography to exclude coexisting coronary artery disease, but we couldn't catheterize the left main coronary trunk. We saw collateral vessels flowing from the right coronary artery to fill the left coronary system. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: We suspected left main coronary atresia or complete occlusion, so we performed a CT coronary angiography for further diagnosis. It confirmed the absence of a left coronary ostium, and your left anterior descending artery and left circumflex arteries are abnormally small. They're both filled by collateral vessels arising from the right coronary artery. Patient: So, what happens next? Doctor: During the operation, we found that your mitral chordae of the posterior leaflet was ruptured, and there's dysplasia of the papillary muscle. We'll perform a successful mitral valvuloplasty first. There's a concern for the small caliber of your left coronary system, but we'll proceed with coronary artery bypass graft surgery, anastomosing the left internal mammary artery to the proximal left anterior descending artery. Patient: I'm worried, but I trust you, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to ensure a successful surgery and recovery. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. [/INST] S: The patient, a farmer, presented with acute onset of dyspnea during physical exertion and orthopnea. He also reported coughing up pink, bubbly sputum. No previous similar symptoms were noted. O: Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 103 bpm and blood pressure of 99/63 mm Hg. A 4/6 systolic murmur was noted. Electrocardiogram showed ST segment depression in leads I, II, aVL, V3-V6. Blood tests showed no troponin elevation. Chest X-ray indicated acute pulmonary congestion. Echocardiogram revealed a prolapsed posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with massive regurgitation, an ejection fraction of 68%, and normal-sized left ventricle. Coronary angiography could not catheterize the left main coronary trunk, showing collateral vessels from the right coronary artery.

A: The patient was diagnosed with acute left heart failure secondary to mitral valve regurgitation. Complications include a suspected left main coronary atresia or complete occlusion, confirmed by imaging showing abnormal coronary artery anatomy. P: The patient is scheduled for mitral valvuloplasty followed by coronary artery bypass graft surgery, using the left internal mammary artery to anastomose to the proximal left anterior descending artery. Pre-operative and post-operative care will include monitoring of cardiac function, management of heart failure symptoms, and ensuring patient understanding and compliance with the treatment plan. Regular follow-ups will be necessary to assess recovery and function post-surgery. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing numbness and cramping in my lower extremities, periodic numbness of fingers I-III of both hands, headache, and general weakness that gradually increased over 8 years. Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any other changes or symptoms in the past few years? Patient: Yes, over the past 2 years, I've had complete hair loss in my legs, thinning and increased vulnerability of the skin of my lower limbs, and the appearance of severe hyperkeratosis on my feet. Doctor: Hmm, that sounds concerning. Have you had any injuries or wounds on your feet? Patient: Yes, I had a callosity on the first toe of my left foot that led to a long-term, non-healing infected wound. It got complicated by gangrene of the terminal phalanx and eventually led to its amputation. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's do a thorough examination to better understand your condition. *After examination* I've observed thinning skin with pigmentation, lamellar desquamation, and hyperkeratosis on the plantar surfaces of your feet (Fig. a–d). There are also multiple epithelized and unhealed infected wounds on your feet that developed as a result of microtrauma. Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Additionally, you seem to be suffering from class II alimentary-constitutional obesity, as your body mass index (BMI) is 37.4. We also conducted a neurological examination and found impaired exteroception with symmetrical hyperesthesia of the metacarpophalangeal joints, hypoesthesia, anesthesia, and thermal hypesthesia to the level of the middle one-third of the legs by polyneuritic type (Fig. e). Your vibrational sensitivity is reduced to 5 seconds by polyneuritic type, and your positional sense is reduced in the distal joints. Patient: What about my reflexes and muscle strength? Doctor: The tendon reflexes of your lower extremities are weakened. Using the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, your muscle strength in the flexors of the lower legs is reduced by 4 grades, by 5 grades in the extensors, and 5 grades in the distal sections. Before starting any treatment, your hand dynamometry measured 38 kg and 36 kg on the left and right sides, respectively. Patient: What does all this mean, and what can I do about it? Doctor: These findings indicate that you have a complex neurological issue that needs to be addressed. We will work on a treatment plan to help improve your symptoms and overall health. In the meantime, it's essential to focus on weight management, as your obesity can exacerbate your symptoms. Patient: Okay, thank you for the information. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get better. Doctor: That's a great attitude! We'll work together to monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. Please schedule a follow-up appointment so we can continue to assess your condition and make any necessary changes to your treatment. Patient: Will do. Thank you so much for your help, Doctor. [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing numbness and cramping in the lower extremities, periodic numbness in fingers I-III of both hands, headaches, and general weakness progressively worsening over 8 years. Additional symptoms developed over the past 2 years include complete hair loss on the legs, thinning and increased vulnerability of the skin on the lower limbs, and severe hyperkeratosis on the feet. The patient also mentioned a history of a non-healing infected wound on the first toe of the left foot, which led to gangrene and subsequent amputation of the terminal phalanx. O: Physical examination revealed thinning skin with pigmentation, lamellar desquamation, and hyperkeratosis on the plantar surfaces of the feet. Multiple epithelized and unhealed infected wounds were noted, likely due to microtrauma. Neurological examination showed impaired exteroception with symmetrical hyperesthesia of the metacarpophalangeal joints, hypoesthesia, anesthesia, and thermal hypesthesia to the middle one-third of the legs by polyneuritic type. Vibrational sensitivity was reduced to 5 seconds, and positional sense was reduced in the distal joints.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you were diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis-complicated ARF and were admitted to our emergency department on March 7, 2013. Can you please tell me about the complaints you had before coming here? Patient: Yes, I had fever, loss of appetite, general fatigue, and sudden muscle weakness. Doctor: I understand. And before coming here, you presented to a local hospital with fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, general fatigue, and sudden muscle weakness, is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Our examination revealed that you had acute kidney injury, hepatic lesion, coagulopathy, and severe anemia. After our assessment, it seems that your rhabdomyolysis was caused by an infectious disease, and it's complicated with multiple organ failure and possible sepsis. At the local hospital, they tried rehydrating you, transfusing blood, and giving you wide-spectrum antibiotics like meropenem, but these treatments didn't show any marked improvement. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: When you arrived at our emergency department, we conducted a physical examination and confirmed the presence of muscle weakness. Your muscle strength was at a grade of 2 to 3. We also identified several laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated CK levels peaking at 8024 IU/L, a Cr level of 37.5 mg/dL, an elevated liver enzyme level of alanine aminotransferase at 104 U/L, a mildly elevated glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase level of 39 U/L, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 39.2 s, a decreased fibrinogen level of 0.67 g/L, and pancytopenia. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it is quite serious. Furthermore, your chest X-ray examination revealed left lower pneumonia, and abdominal ultrasound examination showed hepatosplenomegaly. Ultrasound also revealed enlargement of retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Patient: That's a lot to take in. Doctor: I understand it may be overwhelming. As a result, we diagnosed you with ARF caused by rhabdomyolysis and initiated treatment with hydration, continuous hemodiafiltration, and urine alkalization. Patient: Did the treatment help? Doctor: Yes, it did. We observed significant improvements in your physical strength and renal function, with your Cr level decreasing to 19.5 mg/dL and your CK levels peaking at 136 IU/L. Patient: That's great to hear! Doctor: It is indeed. However, we are still trying to identify the exact cause of your rhabdomyolysis. We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed. It is essential for you to follow up with us and report any new symptoms or changes in your health. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to keep in touch and follow your advice. [/INST] S: The patient reported initial symptoms of fever, loss of appetite, general fatigue, and sudden muscle weakness before hospital admission. These symptoms escalated to include chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, prompting a visit to a local hospital.

The patient is advised to maintain regular follow-ups and report any new symptoms or changes in health status. Further investigations to pinpoint the exact cause of rhabdomyolysis are necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. Can you tell me about the symptoms you've been experiencing lately? Patient: Yeah, I've been having a fever, muscle weakness, trouble speaking, shortness of breath, and difficulty swallowing. Doctor: I see. We've conducted a physical examination on you and found that your muscle power is as follows: right lower extremities proximal 2/5, distal 4/5; upper extremities proximal 3/5, distal 3/5. We also noticed Gottron's sign, which is positive. Patient: Oh, okay. Doctor: Your laboratory results showed a serum CK level of 500 U/L, which is higher than the normal range of 0-195 U/L, and your ANA test was negative. The EMG test showed myogenic damage, and muscle MRI showed diffuse muscle enhancement of proximal legs and limbs. Patient: That doesn't sound good. Doctor: Yes, it is a concern. Your HRCT also showed severe pulmonary parenchyma and interstitial disease. We performed a biopsy on your right quadriceps, revealing denatured, broken, and dissolved muscle, along with focal chronic inflammatory cells and positive Masson staining. Patient: So, what's the plan, Doc? Doctor: We intubated you and placed you on a ventilator for a while. We also administered IVIG at a dose of 2.0 g/kg per month for three months, CTX at 1 g/m2 body surface area intravenously monthly for six months, and high-dose MP at 20 mg/kg daily for five days, followed by prednisone at 2 mg/kg daily. Patient: Did that help? Doctor: Yes, two weeks later, your dyspnea improved, and we removed the tracheal intubation. One month after that, your dysphagia and dysphonia also improved. However, the muscle weakness and rash didn't show significant improvement. Patient: Hmm, so what's next? Doctor: We decided to give you methotrexate (MTX) at 15 mg/m2 body surface area and cyclosporine A (CsA) to help further improve your condition. Patient: Did that work? Doctor: Unfortunately, nine months after the initial treatment, your muscle weakness and rash still didn't improve as much as we hoped. Therefore, we recommended an AHSCT, and you received the transplant in January 2008. Patient: Oh, I see. So, what do we do now? Doctor: We'll continue to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan accordingly. It's important to keep regular appointments and follow our recommendations to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing fever, muscle weakness, trouble speaking, shortness of breath, and difficulty swallowing. O: Physical examination revealed muscle power of right lower extremities proximal 2/5, distal 4/5; upper extremities proximal 3/5, distal 3/5, and positive Gottron's sign. Laboratory tests showed elevated serum CK level at 500 U/L (normal 0-195 U/L), negative ANA test. EMG indicated myogenic damage, and muscle MRI revealed diffuse muscle enhancement in proximal legs and limbs. HRCT demonstrated severe pulmonary parenchyma and interstitial disease. Muscle biopsy of the right quadriceps showed denatured, broken, and dissolved muscle with focal chronic inflammatory cells and positive Masson staining. A: The patient's clinical presentation and diagnostic findings suggest a severe inflammatory myopathy, likely dermatomyositis, with associated interstitial lung disease. Differential diagnosis could include other inflammatory myopathies. P: The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation, treated with IVIG at 2.0 g/kg per month for three months, CTX at 1 g/m2 body surface area monthly for six months, and high-dose MP at 20 mg/kg daily for five days followed by prednisone at 2 mg/kg daily. Subsequent treatments included methotrexate at 15 mg/m2 body surface area and cyclosporine A. Despite initial improvements in dyspnea, dysphagia, and dysphonia, muscle weakness and rash persisted, leading to the administration of AHSCT in January 2008. Ongoing monitoring and adjustments to the treatment plan are necessary to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Regular follow-up appointments are crucial. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, I see that you presented in late 2016 with exertional shortness of breath, mild pedal edema, distended neck veins, and a recent weight gain of 15 lbs over the prior 2 weeks. How have you been feeling lately? Patient: Yeah, I've been experiencing some worsening respiratory symptoms, but no fever, hemoptysis, sputum production, B symptoms, or extremity edema. Doctor: I remember that initially, we suspected pulmonary embolism due to your elevated D-dimer levels. However, further testing revealed that you were experiencing cardiac tamponade with mild pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. We performed a pericardiocentesis, but we couldn't find any definitive diagnosis. In February 2017, we reviewed your baseline chest PET-CT images from both UCLA Oncology and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center which showed a large middle mediastinal mass encasing the main pulmonary artery, with pericardial and left pleural effusion. Scattered pulmonary nodules and hypodense lesions were identified in the right lobe of your liver, consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Patient: Yeah, that's right. And then they did a biopsy of the mediastinal mass, right? Doctor: Yes, the biopsy revealed a high grade undifferentiated malignant neoplasm composed of highly proliferative malignant cells with large areas of necrosis and fibrosis. The ki67 staining was about 50%. Immunohistochemistry showed strong antigenicity for CD31 and CD34, and weak antigenicity for D2-40 and Factor VIII. This indicated a diagnosis of angiosarcoma, which was corroborated at both UC San Diego Health and MD Anderson. Patient: I remember discussing conventional treatment options, but I declined those because of the low reported survival rates. Doctor: That's correct. Instead, you requested the non-selective beta blocker propranolol as a single agent therapy. In May 2017, we started administering 40 mg/kg propranolol daily. We performed PET-CT scans at regular intervals to assess the response of the tumor to propranolol. Assessment of tumor response was based on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer uptake and measurements/assessments of the primary tumor and distant metastases. Patient: So, how has the propranolol been working? Doctor: After 12 months of propranolol as a single agent therapy, we've seen significant improvement in your condition. We will continue to monitor your progress closely and adjust the treatment as needed. Patient: That's great to hear! Thank you for all your help, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out. We're here to support you on your journey to recovery. [/INST] S: The patient reports worsening respiratory symptoms but denies fever, hemoptysis, sputum production, B symptoms, or extremity edema. Initially presented in late 2016 with exertional shortness of breath, mild pedal edema, distended neck veins, and a recent weight gain of 15 lbs over 2 weeks. The patient declined conventional treatment options due to low survival rates and opted for non-selective beta blocker therapy. O: Initial suspicion of pulmonary embolism due to elevated D-dimer levels, later diagnosed with cardiac tamponade, mild pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure. Baseline chest PET-CT showed a large middle mediastinal mass encasing the main pulmonary artery, pericardial and left pleural effusion, scattered pulmonary nodules, and hypodense lesions in the right lobe of the liver, indicating metastatic disease. Biopsy of the mediastinal mass confirmed high-grade undifferentiated malignant neoplasm, likely angiosarcoma. Propranolol therapy started in May 2017 at 40 mg/kg daily. Recent follow-up shows significant improvement after 12 months of therapy. A: Primary diagnosis of angiosarcoma with metastatic disease involving the lungs and liver. The patient is currently under management with propranolol, showing significant improvement. The prognosis remains cautious due to the aggressive nature of angiosarcoma. P: Continue monitoring the patient's response to propranolol therapy with regular PET-CT scans. Adjust the dosage as necessary based on tumor response and patient's tolerance to the medication. Provide supportive care and address any new symptoms or complications that arise. Encourage the patient to maintain regular follow-up appointments and reach out with any concerns or symptoms. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, what brings you in today? Patient: My daughter has been feeling unwell. She has a fever and has been really tired. Her lower lip is swollen and her tongue is sore. Doctor: I see. Let's start with an oral examination to take a closer look.  Patient: Okay. Doctor: Hmm, her lips are quite dry, cracked, and red. There's localized swelling on her lower lip and it seems to be itching her. Has she experienced anything like this before? Patient: Yes, she had a similar swelling when she was diagnosed with Kawasaki disease at 4 years old, but it was very rare. Doctor: Interesting. I also noticed that she has a bright red, erythematous tongue - also known as a strawberry tongue. Was this present during her past Kawasaki disease episode as well? Patient: Yes, it appeared a few days after her lip swelling started. Doctor: Alright. Considering her past medical history, it's possible that this could be a recurrence of Kawasaki disease. I'll need to ask a few more questions to rule out other potential diagnoses like scarlet fever. Has she had a sore throat or tonsillar exudate recently? Patient: No, she hasn't complained about a sore throat or anything like that. Doctor: Good to know. I didn't notice any oral exudates, ulcerations, or Koplik's spots during the examination either, which further reduces the likelihood of scarlet fever. Has anyone in your family experienced similar symptoms? Patient: No, we haven't had any similar complaints in the family. Doctor: Okay, thank you for the information. I also observed that her maxilla is more prognathic, and her maxillary teeth are protruded. I'll need to order a lateral cephalometric radiograph of her nasopharynx to evaluate any potential airway obstruction due to an enlarged adenoid gland. Patient: Sure, please let us know what you find. Doctor: After completing the radiograph, we found that there is an enlargement of her adenoid gland, causing narrowing of the air passage. Given her symptoms and history, I suspect that this could be a recurrence of Kawasaki disease. I'm going to refer you to a pediatrician for further checkups and investigations. Patient: Thank you, doctor. We'll make sure to follow up with the pediatrician. Doctor: Great. The pediatrician will likely run some tests to confirm the diagnosis. During her previous hospitalization for Kawasaki disease, she had an increased total white blood cell (WBC) count of 15,600/mm3 with 70% neutrophils, an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 60 mm at the end of 1 hour, and a high serum C-reactive protein level of 96 mg/L. These tests will help the pediatrician determine if it is indeed a recurrence. Patient: Thanks for all your help, doctor. We'll make sure to keep a close eye on her symptoms and follow up with the pediatrician as soon as possible. [/INST] S: The patient, a young girl, presented with symptoms of fever, fatigue, swollen lower lip, and a sore, erythematous tongue described as a strawberry tongue. The mother reports a past medical history of Kawasaki disease diagnosed at age 4, with similar symptoms occurring during that episode. No recent sore throat, tonsillar exudate, or family history of similar symptoms were reported. O: Physical examination revealed dry, cracked, and red lips with localized swelling and itching on the lower lip. The oral examination did not show any exudates, ulcerations, or Koplik's spots. A lateral cephalometric radiograph indicated an enlarged adenoid gland causing narrowing of the air passage. Previous hospitalization records for Kawasaki disease showed an increased WBC count of 15,600/mm3 with 70% neutrophils, ESR of 60 mm/hr, and CRP of 96 mg/L. A: The primary assessment is a suspected recurrence of Kawasaki disease, given the clinical presentation and past medical history. Differential diagnosis includes conditions like scarlet fever, which was considered less likely due to the absence of sore throat, tonsillar exudate, and specific oral findings. P: The plan includes referring the patient to a pediatrician for further evaluation and confirmation of the diagnosis through necessary tests such as WBC count, ESR, and CRP levels. The pediatrician will also manage potential complications and oversee the treatment protocol for Kawasaki disease, if confirmed. The importance of close monitoring of symptoms and prompt follow-up with the pediatrician was emphasized to the mother. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you tell me how your 11-month-old daughter has been feeling after her open pyeloplasty surgery for the pelvic ureteric junction obstruction? Patient's parent: Hi doctor, she has been having a low-grade fever and has been quite irritable since the first postoperative day. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a bit about her medical history? Patient's parent: Sure, her birth and developmental history have been normal, but she did have two episodes of pyelonephritis and a right pyeloureteral stenosis, which led to the pyeloplasty surgery. She's been on fosfomycin antibiotic prophylaxis for the last few months. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Did she receive any antibiotics during the surgery? Patient's parent: Yes, she was given a single dose of amoxiclavulanate intravenously. Doctor: Alright. When I examined her during the first 12 hours after the surgery, she was a febrile irritable infant with a pulse of 120 and normal blood pressure. Her neutrophil count was elevated at 19.8 × 10^9/L and her C-reactive protein was also high at 9.1 U/L. Additionally, her hemoglobin decreased from 11.5 to 8.3 mg/dL post-surgery.  Patient's parent: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Yes, we needed to take action to address these issues. Her surgical wound appeared slightly erythematous at the time, so we started her on cefotaxime therapy at 150 mg/kg/day e.v. and ordered an erythrocyte transfusion. Patient's parent: I see. How did she respond to the treatment? Doctor: Unfortunately, the local examination the next day revealed a dark bluish erythema of the entire surgical wound measuring 9 × 6 cm, and a satellite lesion 5 cm away. These lesions were tender and warm upon palpation. It seems that a ring retractor used during surgery to enhance the surgical field view might have caused the satellite lesion. Patient's parent: Oh no, that's not good. Doctor: Yes, we also noticed that her entire right flank appeared erythematous and warm. Her C-reactive protein and leukocyte count increased to 23.5 × 10^9/L and 23.4 U/L, respectively. She was still febrile and tachycardic, but thankfully did not require further homodynamic or ventilatory support. Patient's parent: So, what's the diagnosis, doctor? Doctor: We have determined that she has a necrotizing soft-tissue infection (NSTI) with sepsis. We've started her on meropenem at 60 mg/kg/day e.v. to help treat the infection. Patient's parent: I hope that helps her. Thank you for all your efforts, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, an 11-month-old female, presented with low-grade fever and irritability since the first postoperative day following open pyeloplasty for pelvic ureteric junction obstruction. Her medical history includes normal birth and developmental milestones, two episodes of pyelonephritis, and right pyeloureteral stenosis. She has been on fosfomycin antibiotic prophylaxis for several months. O: Post-surgery, the patient was febrile with a pulse of 120 bpm and normal blood pressure. Initial labs showed elevated neutrophil count (19.8 × 10^9/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP) at 9.1 U/L, with a decrease in hemoglobin from 11.5 to 8.3 mg/dL. The surgical wound was erythematous, and subsequent exams revealed dark bluish erythema of the wound (9 × 6 cm) with a satellite lesion (5 cm away), both tender and warm. The entire right flank was erythematous and warm. Follow-up labs showed increased CRP (23.4 U/L) and leukocyte count (23.5 × 10^9/L). She was tachycardic but stable hemodynamically and ventilatorily. A: The primary diagnosis is necrotizing soft-tissue infection (NSTI) with sepsis, likely exacerbated by surgical complications and a possible reaction to the ring retractor used during surgery. P: The patient was started on cefotaxime (150 mg/kg/day e.v.) and received an erythrocyte transfusion. Due to the severity of the infection, treatment was escalated to meropenem (60 mg/kg/day e.v.). Continuous monitoring of vital signs, blood counts, and inflammatory markers is necessary. Further surgical consultation may be required to assess the need for surgical debridement. Education provided to the parents about signs of worsening infection and the importance of adherence to the antibiotic regimen. Follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor progress and adjust treatment as necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, I understand you've been referred to me with a 6-month history of a right anterior chest mass. Can you tell me more about any symptoms you've been experiencing? Patient: Yes, I've noticed a firm mass in my chest and it's quite tender when I touch it. Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. We've performed a physical examination, and I can confirm the presence of a palpable firm mass with tenderness in your right anterior chest. Your routine laboratory investigations are within the biological reference range, which is good news. Patient: Oh, that's a relief! Doctor: We also conducted an enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) to get a better look at the mass. The CT showed a dumbbell-shaped mass with calcification. Its anterior portion is located under your pectoralis minor muscle and the posterior portion projects to your thoracic cavity. Patient: Hmm, sounds complicated. Doctor: We also did a chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to further assess the mass. The MRI indicated an invasive tumor, which was isointense on T1-weighted images and heterogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted images.  Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It means that the tumor has an aggressive nature, and it's growing into the surrounding tissues. An aspiration biopsy cytology was also performed by your previous physician, and it showed malignancy. However, there's no evidence of distant metastasis, which means the tumor hasn't spread to other parts of your body. Patient: Okay, so what's the next step? Doctor: We've planned a surgical resection of the tumor with chest reconstruction. During the surgery, you'll be placed in a supine position. We'll first examine inside your thoracic cavity with thoracoscopy through the seventh intercostal space to ensure there's no lung invasion of the tumor. Patient: I see. Doctor: Then, we'll perform a wide resection, including the middle part of your pectoralis major muscle, the pectoralis minor muscle, and the third and fourth ribs. We'll make sure to achieve a negative margin of the tumor, which means all the cancerous tissue will be removed. Patient: That sounds good. Doctor: For the chest wall reconstruction, we'll use a 2-mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) patch to cover the area and then cover it with spared skin and breast. The operation will take approximately 3 hours and 33 minutes, with an estimated intraoperative blood loss of 64 ml. Patient: I understand. Doctor: After the surgery, we'll analyze the resected specimen. The tumor cells are expected to show an epithelioid appearance with cytoplasmic eosinophilia. They'll have large vesicular nuclei and will be arranged in a sheet-like pattern. In some areas, scattered microcalcification might be observed. Patient: What does that mean for my recovery? Doctor: Based on the immunohistochemical analysis, we'll be able to determine the best course of treatment and recovery for you. Our goal is to ensure the tumor has been completely removed and to minimize the risk of recurrence. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your thorough explanation and the plan for my treatment. [/INST] S: The patient reports a 6-month history of a right anterior chest mass, which is firm and tender to touch. O: Physical examination confirmed a palpable, firm, tender mass in the right anterior chest. Routine laboratory investigations are within normal limits. Enhanced chest CT revealed a dumbbell-shaped mass with calcification, located under the pectoralis minor muscle and projecting into the thoracic cavity. Chest MRI showed the mass to be isointense on T1-weighted images and heterogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted images, indicating an invasive nature. Aspiration biopsy cytology confirmed malignancy without evidence of distant metastasis. A: The primary diagnosis is a malignant, invasive chest wall tumor without distant metastasis. Differential diagnoses could include benign chest wall tumors, but these are less likely given the biopsy results and imaging characteristics. P: The management plan includes surgical resection of the tumor with chest reconstruction. The surgery will involve thoracoscopy, wide resection of the tumor including part of the pectoralis major and minor muscles and the third and fourth ribs, aiming for negative margins. Chest wall reconstruction will be performed using a 2-mm ePTFE patch. Post-operative care will include analysis of the resected specimen and immunohistochemical analysis to guide further treatment and recovery. The estimated duration of the surgery is 3 hours and 33 minutes with an expected blood loss of 64 ml. The goal is complete tumor removal and minimization of recurrence risk. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, can you please tell me what symptoms your 14-month old son has been experiencing recently? Patient's parent: Hi, doctor. He's been having respiratory distress, wheeze, and hypoxia. This started after 24 hours of coryza, fever, and reduced feeding. Doctor: I see. We've admitted your son to the intensive care unit and diagnosed him with pneumonia. We've started treatment with empirical antibiotics. He was intubated and ventilated for 4 days, after which he was extubated and stepped down to the high dependency unit (HDU) on continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) ventilation. Patient's parent: Oh, okay. How is he doing now? Doctor: He continues to have an increased work of breathing, persistent expiratory wheeze, and symptoms and signs of air trapping. Although he did not progress to respiratory failure, weight gain and oxygenation were achieved only by initiation of Heated Humidified High Flow Nasal cannula therapy (HHHFNC). Patient's parent: I see. Were any tests done to determine the cause of his condition? Doctor: Yes, we performed Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), which revealed the persistence of rhinovirus and adenovirus for 10 weeks in both NPAs and bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs), with parainfluenza type 3 found in just one NPA sample. Adenovirus was also found in his blood by PCR testing. Unfortunately, there was no validated assay available for testing rhinovirus in blood samples. Patient's parent: Hmm, were any other tests done? Doctor: Yes, one BAL and one urine sample were screened for cytomegalovirus (CMV) by PCR and found to be negative. One stool sample was also tested and found to be negative for rotavirus and adenovirus, despite the persistence of adenovirus in the respiratory samples at that time. Patient's parent: What about his family history? Are there any genetic diseases we should be worried about? Doctor: There is no significant family history of any genetic diseases. Your son was born at term, and I understand that the mother is a smoker but did not smoke during her pregnancy. During pregnancy, intrauterine growth restriction was identified. Patient's parent: Yes, that's correct. His weight was less than the 0.4th centile at the time of admission, but it's been increasing. We've noticed poor feeding since birth and an increased work of breathing from 5 months old. Doctor: I see. He is known to the allergy services for severe eczema and faltering weight, and has been diagnosed with cow's milk protein allergy. It's important to continue monitoring his condition and follow up with the recommended treatments and therapies. Patient's parent: Thank you, doctor. We'll make sure to follow your advice and keep a close eye on his progress. [/INST] S: The patient, a 14-month-old male, presented with respiratory distress, wheeze, and hypoxia following symptoms of coryza, fever, and reduced feeding. The parent reports that the child has had poor feeding since birth, increased work of breathing from 5 months old, and a history of severe eczema and cow's milk protein allergy. There is no significant family history of genetic diseases. The mother is a smoker but did not smoke during pregnancy. The child was born at term with intrauterine growth restriction and was underweight at admission. O: Upon admission, the child was diagnosed with pneumonia, intubated, and ventilated for 4 days, followed by treatment in the high dependency unit on CPAP. Current treatment includes Heated Humidified High Flow Nasal Cannula therapy. PCR testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavages showed persistence of rhinovirus and adenovirus for 10 weeks, with adenovirus also found in his blood. Tests for CMV and rotavirus were negative. The child's weight was below the 0.4th centile at admission but has shown improvement. A: The primary diagnosis is severe viral pneumonia complicated by persistent adenovirus and rhinovirus infection. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of chronic respiratory distress and failure to thrive, considering the child's background of severe eczema and cow's milk protein allergy. The prognosis depends on the resolution of the viral infections and management of his chronic conditions. P: Continue current respiratory support and empirical antibiotic therapy. Monitor viral load and respiratory status closely. Nutritional support to address faltering weight and dietary restrictions due to cow's milk protein allergy. Regular follow-ups with allergy and pediatric services to manage eczema and monitor developmental progress. Educate the parent on the importance of smoke-free environments and adherence to dietary restrictions. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see that you've been referred to our Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics here at Sathyabama Dental College and Hospital, Chennai. What seems to be the problem? Patient: Hi, Doctor. My private practitioner referred me here because I've been experiencing sensitivity and occasional pain in the left region of my upper front teeth. Doctor: I see. Let me perform a clinical examination to better understand the issue. Hmm, it appears you have a crown-bridge prosthesis spanning from the left upper canine to the right upper canine. The stability of the prosthesis seems to be compromised. We should remove it and take an intraoral radiograph in relation to the #12 and #13 region. (After removing the prosthesis and taking a radiograph) Doctor: The radiograph reveals distoproximal dental caries involving enamel, dentin, and pulp of tooth #13. Based on this and an electric pulp test, it seems you have symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. What do you recommend, Doctor? Doctor: Don't worry, we can manage this. In our first visit, we'll perform a root canal treatment on tooth #13 under local anesthesia (Lignox 2%; Indoco Remedies Ltd., Mumbai) and with rubber dam (Hygienic, Coltene Whaledent) isolation.  Patient: Okay, let's do it. (After initiating root canal treatment) Doctor: I've made an access cavity using an endo-access bur (bur type FG-1; Dentsply, USA) and located a single root canal orifice. The tentative working length is 26 mm, determined with an apex locator (Root ZX mini; J Morita, Japan). I performed hand instrumentation (K-files, Mani Inc., Japan) up to size #50, with copious saline and sodium hypochlorite (3%) irrigation during each change. Patient: What's next, Doctor? Doctor: I'm placing calcium hydroxide (RC-Cal; Prime Dental Ltd., India) as an intracanal medicament inside the canal. The access cavity will be temporized with Cavit (3M ESPE, Germany). We'll schedule a second visit for further management. (Before the scheduled second visit, the patient reports to the department with severe pain) Patient: Doctor, I'm in severe pain in relation to tooth #13! Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's reenter the access cavity and see what's going on. It looks like there's fresh bleeding. We'll need to take multiple angulated radiographs with two different files to better understand the situation. (After taking the radiographs) Doctor: Alright, we may need to adjust our treatment plan based on these new findings. I'll discuss them with you and we'll determine the best course of action. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help in getting me relief from this pain. [/INST] S: The patient reports sensitivity and occasional pain in the left region of the upper front teeth. The patient has a history of having a crown-bridge prosthesis from the left upper canine to the right upper canine. O: Clinical examination revealed a compromised stability of the crown-bridge prosthesis. Intraoral radiograph and electric pulp test indicated distoproximal dental caries involving enamel, dentin, and pulp of tooth #13, diagnosed as symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. Initial root canal treatment was started with access cavity preparation, canal orifice location, and hand instrumentation up to size #50. Calcium hydroxide was placed as an intracanal medicament, and the cavity was temporized with Cavit. The patient returned with severe pain, prompting reevaluation through multiple angulated radiographs. A: Primary diagnosis is symptomatic irreversible pulpitis of tooth #13 with complications including severe pain post-initial treatment, suggesting possible issues like inadequate debridement or secondary infection. P: The management plan includes continuation of root canal treatment under local anesthesia with necessary adjustments based on the latest radiographic findings. The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up visit to complete the root canal treatment, ensure proper canal debridement, and possibly adjust the intracanal medication. Emphasis will be placed on pain management and monitoring for signs of infection or other complications. Education regarding post-procedural care and symptoms to watch for will be provided to ensure patient compliance and prompt reporting of any issues. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 27-year-old female without any prior medical and family history. Can you tell me what brings you in today? Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing nausea, confusion, and petechial bleeding. I'm really worried about it. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll definitely look into it and figure out what's going on. In the meantime, we need to admit you into the intensive care unit for closer monitoring. Patient: Okay, that sounds serious. What will you be doing there? Doctor: We'll be initiating renal replacement therapy, specifically continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), to address your anuric AKI. We'll also be conducting a thorough laboratory examination. Patient: What are the results of the laboratory examination? Doctor: Your lab results showed that you have thrombocytopenia and Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia. Your hemoglobin level is 3.7 mmol/L, platelets are 118 × 109/L, haptoglobin is less than 0.1 g/L, fragmented erythrocytes are at 1%, and lactate dehydrogenase is higher than 13 mmol/L. However, your ADAMTS13 levels and activity are normal, at over 50%, and there are no ADAMTS13 autoantibodies. Patient: Oh, that sounds complicated. What does that all mean? Doctor: It means that we need to do further Complement analysis and a percutaneous kidney biopsy to determine the cause of your symptoms. The analysis showed reduced levels of C3 (0.5 – 0.7 g/l; reference range: 0.8 – 1.6) and normal levels for C4. The kidney biopsy showed signs of acute and non-acute preglomerular and intraglomerular TMA. Patient: What's the plan for my treatment, then? Doctor: We'll start you on intravenous glucocorticoids and 6 weeks of plasma exchange. However, your condition will only improve after we add a C5-inhibitor called eculizumab. You'll receive 4 weeks of induction followed by 6 months of maintenance therapy. Patient: Will my condition get better after that? Doctor: Yes, your condition will slowly resolve, and you'll achieve complete hematological and clinical remission. Your kidney function will gradually recover over several months, allowing us to terminate hemodialysis. Patient: What about my long-term prognosis? Doctor: Long-term follow-up over 6 years showed no relapse and stable renal function at CKD stage 3, which means your kidneys are functioning at 40-50 ml/min/1.73 m2 according to the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) guidelines. You won't require continued maintenance therapy. Patient: That's a relief. What caused all of this in the first place? Doctor: We performed targeted next-generation sequencing using a gene panel consisting of 14 aHUS-associated genes. We identified a novel heterozygous canonical splice site variant in the CFH gene as the cause of your condition. Patient: Thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. I feel much better knowing there's a plan for my treatment and recovery. [/INST] S: The patient, a 27-year-old female with no significant past medical or family history, presents with nausea, confusion, and petechial bleeding. She expresses concern about her symptoms. O: On admission, the patient's laboratory tests revealed thrombocytopenia and Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 3.7 mmol/L, platelets at 118 × 10^9/L, haptoglobin less than 0.1 g/L, fragmented erythrocytes at 1%, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase over 13 mmol/L. ADAMTS13 levels and activity were normal. Complement analysis showed reduced C3 levels (0.5 – 0.7 g/l; reference range: 0.8 – 1.6) with normal C4 levels. Kidney biopsy indicated acute and non-acute preglomerular and intraglomerular thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).

A: The patient is diagnosed with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) secondary to a CFH gene mutation, presenting with acute kidney injury (AKI), requiring renal replacement therapy, and hematological abnormalities including severe anemia and thrombocytopenia. P: The treatment plan includes admission to the intensive care unit for continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), initiation of intravenous glucocorticoids, and a 6-week course of plasma exchange. This will be followed by 4 weeks of induction therapy with the C5-inhibitor eculizumab and a subsequent 6 months of maintenance therapy. Long-term follow-up over 6 years is planned to monitor for relapse and assess renal function, which is expected to stabilize at CKD stage 3 as per CKD-EPI guidelines. No continued maintenance therapy beyond this period is anticipated. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I understand that you've been experiencing some transient episodes of amnesia and independent short-duration loss of awareness with oral automatism. Can you tell me more about these episodes? Patient: Yeah, they've been happening more frequently lately, and my memory has been getting worse too. Doctor: I see. You mentioned that you had a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) done at a local hospital, and they found a cavernous malformation (CM) in your right amygdala. You were also diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer's Disease (AD) concomitant with temporal lobe epilepsy. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. They referred me to your epilepsy center for further treatment. Doctor: I understand. We performed a seven-day scalp video-EEG here at our epilepsy center, but we didn't capture any interictal epileptiform discharges, impaired awareness seizures, or oral automatisms. However, based on your clinical history and the CM in your right amygdala, we diagnosed you with epileptic amnesia (EA) and prescribed levetiracetam. Has the medication helped? Patient: It has decreased the frequency of the amnesic episodes a bit, but they're still happening. Doctor: I see. As we started to suspect that the CM in your right amygdala might be contributing to your EA and cognitive decline, we conducted some neuropsychological examinations. Your preoperative Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 25/30, Hasegawa's dementia scale-revised (HDS-R) was 22/30, Weschler memory scale (WMS)-III showed verbal memory at 79, visual memory at 68, and total memory at 72. Your trail making test (TMT)-A took 1 min 27 s, and TMT-B took 3 min 37 s.  Patient: Hmm, okay. So, what's the next step? Doctor: We've planned a minimally invasive intraoperative subdural electrode (SE) recording directly from the parahippocampal area via a small burr hole and skin incision. We decided that if we find epileptiform discharges during the SE recording, we will proceed to remove the CM. If we don't find any epileptiform discharges, we will just withdraw the SE and close the incision. Patient: Alright. What happened during the procedure? Doctor: Intraoperatively, the SE recording from your right parahippocampal area showed frequent epileptiform discharges. As a result, we decided to proceed with the selective removal of the CM in your right amygdala. Patient: I see. So, what should I expect now? Doctor: We will closely monitor your progress and recovery. Hopefully, the removal of the CM will help improve your memory and decrease the frequency of your amnesic episodes. We'll also continue to manage your early-stage AD and temporal lobe epilepsy with appropriate medications and follow-up appointments. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance. [/INST] S: The patient reports increased frequency of transient amnesic episodes and worsening memory. They have been diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and temporal lobe epilepsy, with a cavernous malformation (CM) in the right amygdala. O: Recent brain MRI revealed a CM in the right amygdala. Seven-day scalp video-EEG at our epilepsy center showed no interictal epileptiform discharges or impaired awareness seizures. Neuropsychological tests showed MMSE score of 25/30, HDS-R score of 22/30, WMS-III verbal memory at 79, visual memory at 68, total memory at 72, TMT-A at 1 min 27 s, and TMT-B at 3 min 37 s. Intraoperative subdural electrode recording indicated frequent epileptiform discharges in the right parahippocampal area, leading to the selective removal of the CM in the right amygdala. A: The primary diagnosis is epileptic amnesia (EA) associated with a CM in the right amygdala, early-stage Alzheimer's Disease, and temporal lobe epilepsy. The presence of the CM and its removal are likely contributing factors to the patient's cognitive symptoms and epileptic episodes. P: Continue monitoring the patient's recovery post-CM removal to assess improvement in memory and reduction in amnesic episodes. Manage early-stage AD and temporal lobe epilepsy with ongoing medication, including levetiracetam, which has shown some efficacy in reducing the frequency of amnesic episodes. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as necessary. Educate the patient on the importance of medication adherence and regular monitoring of their condition. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see from your past medical history that you have autoimmune hepatitis and hypothyroidism. What brings you here today? Patient: I was at home eating when suddenly my left arm became weak and started having jerky movements. My family called emergency medical services and they brought me here. Doctor: I see. Did you experience any recent trauma, fall, earache, hearing loss, or discharge? Patient: No, none of those. I didn't lose consciousness either. Doctor: Okay. So you're on azathioprine for your autoimmune hepatitis, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: We evaluated you for a possible stroke when you arrived. Your vital signs showed an elevated blood pressure of 153/72 mmHg, normal pulse at 91, and normal respiratory rate at 17. You were afebrile as well. The lab workup revealed a normal white cell count of 7.2 109/L, normal hemoglobin of 12 gm/dL, but your platelets were low at 80 109/L. Your serum chemistry was unremarkable except for low sodium of 129 mEq/L. The urine drug screen and COVID-19 PCR test were both negative. Patient: Hmm, alright. Doctor: We did a Computed Tomography (CT) scan of your head upon admission, which revealed left temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, right frontal sulcal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and left parietal sulcal subarachnoid hemorrhage. We also performed a Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) of your head and neck, which showed extensive venous sinus thrombosis involving the superior sagittal sinus, as well as the bilateral transverse and sigmoid sinuses. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it is. We then did a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of your brain with and without contrast, along with a Magnetic Resonance Venogram (MRV), which confirmed the extensive venous sinus thrombosis and multicompartment bleeding. Patient: So what's the plan now? Doctor: Our interventional neurology, neurosurgery, and neuro critical care teams have evaluated you. We've started you on levetiracetam for symptomatic treatment of the focal seizures causing the left upper extremity shaking. You've also been started on anticoagulation with a heparin drip and have been admitted to the neuro ICU for close neurological monitoring. Patient: How long will I be in the hospital? Doctor: We'll monitor your progress closely. We've achieved the desired therapeutic level of activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) at 67.2 s within 24 hours. We'll continue to adjust the treatment as needed and keep you informed. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any more questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of autoimmune hepatitis and hypothyroidism, presented with sudden onset of left arm weakness and jerky movements while eating at home. The patient denies any recent trauma, fall, earache, hearing loss, discharge, or loss of consciousness. The patient is currently on azathioprine for autoimmune hepatitis. O: Vital signs on admission showed elevated blood pressure at 153/72 mmHg, normal pulse at 91 bpm, and respiratory rate at 17 breaths per minute. The patient was afebrile. Laboratory results indicated a normal white cell count of 7.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 12 gm/dL, low platelets at 80 x 10^9/L, and low sodium at 129 mEq/L. Urine drug screen and COVID-19 PCR were negative. Imaging included a CT scan revealing left temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage. CTA showed extensive venous sinus thrombosis involving the superior sagittal sinus and bilateral transverse and sigmoid sinuses. MRI and MRV confirmed these findings. A: The primary diagnosis is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with associated intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of stroke or central nervous system infections, which seem less likely given the imaging and clinical presentation. P: The patient has been started on levetiracetam for seizure management and a heparin drip for anticoagulation, with close monitoring in the neuro ICU. The therapeutic level of aPTT was achieved at 67.2 seconds within 24 hours. The treatment plan includes ongoing adjustment of anticoagulation therapy and neurological monitoring. The patient will be informed continuously about the progress and any changes in the treatment plan. Further consultations with interventional neurology, neurosurgery, and neuro critical care teams are planned. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see this is case 6, a 40-year-old woman with a history of SLE for fifteen years. Can you tell me about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, I've had urticarial vasculitis, polyarthritis, haemolytic anemia, and a positive ANA. I've also had periods of reactivation and remission of cutaneous and hematological manifestations. Doctor: I understand. For your treatment, you've been on hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, dapsone, methotrexate, and cyclosporine with variable responses, and also low dose steroids, is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Your current hospitalization is due to fever, low back pain, and criteria for urinary sepsis. We've also found nephrotic range proteinuria. Can you explain the investigation results? Patient: Sure, they confirmed I have left renal vein thrombosis. Doctor: I see. Additionally, there is a diffuse infiltrate present in the right lower lobe of your lungs and hepatosplenomegaly. We've tested your pp65 antigenemia, and it came back positive. However, no specific antiviral treatment was prescribed at that time. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: You initially showed improvement with antibiotic therapy for your urinary infection, and you were discharged from the intensive care unit. But you experienced clinical worsening two weeks later and maintained pp65 antigenemia positivity, so we started you on ganciclovir. How have you been feeling since then? Patient: I have had a significant improvement since starting the ganciclovir. Doctor: That's good to hear. Our recent laboratorial monitoring showed that your pp65 antigenemia is now negative. We will continue to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed. Please keep in touch with any changes in your symptoms or concerns. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help, and I will keep you updated on my condition. [/INST] S: The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a 15-year history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). She reports a history of urticarial vasculitis, polyarthritis, haemolytic anemia, and a positive Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) test. Her SLE has had periods of reactivation and remission affecting her skin and blood. She is currently experiencing fever, low back pain, and symptoms consistent with urinary sepsis. She has been treated with multiple immunosuppressants and steroids with variable responses. O: The patient's current hospitalization revealed nephrotic range proteinuria and left renal vein thrombosis. Imaging showed diffuse infiltrates in the right lower lobe of the lungs and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests confirmed positive pp65 antigenemia, indicating a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Initial improvement was noted with antibiotic therapy for urinary infection, but clinical worsening occurred two weeks post-discharge with maintained pp65 antigenemia positivity. Recent labs show pp65 antigenemia is now negative. A: The primary diagnosis is SLE with complications including renal vein thrombosis and CMV infection. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of nephrotic syndrome and secondary infections due to immunosuppression. The prognosis depends on the management of SLE flares, control of CMV infection, and prevention of further thrombotic events. P: Continue monitoring SLE activity and manage with appropriate immunosuppressive therapy. Ganciclovir treatment for CMV infection will be continued until full resolution of symptoms and negative pp65 antigenemia is consistently observed. Regular follow-up for renal function and thrombosis monitoring is necessary. Patient education on signs of SLE flare and infection is crucial for early detection and management. Referral to a nephrologist for renal vein thrombosis and a rheumatologist for SLE management is recommended. Compliance with medication and follow-up appointments is essential for effective management. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you're here for a consultation regarding your arthralgia. How can I help you today? Patient: Yes, doctor. Recently, I've been experiencing some discomfort in my joints. And I've also noticed some heart murmurs and shortness of breath that seems to be getting worse. Doctor: I see. Let's review your test results to better understand your condition. According to your records, you were referred to the cardiothoracic department at the university hospital in the same city. Your height is 153 cm, and your body weight is 67 kg. The chest radiography showed an increased pulmonary vascular shadow and cardiomegaly. Electrocardiography detected left ventricular hypertrophy. Have you experienced any other symptoms? Patient: Hmm, not really. Just some difficulty in breathing, especially during physical activities. Doctor: Alright. Based on your transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), we can see that you have left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) dilatation. The LA volume measured 85 mm, and the LV end diastolic dimension was 58 mm. The TTE also showed a dilated ascending aorta with mild aortic regurgitation and mild mitral valve regurgitation. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. Doctor: Additionally, the TTE revealed the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with continuous flow observed from the descending aorta to the pulmonary artery (PA). The estimated pulmonary to systemic ratio (Qp/Qs) was 1.2. To further investigate, we performed contrast-enhanced 3D computed tomography (CT) to determine the anatomical details around the PDA. Patient: And what did the CT scan show, doctor? Doctor: The CT scan revealed a conically shaped duct with calcification at the aortic end. The PDA with calcification at the aortic end measured 14 mm in diameter, arising from the descending aorta, and was 30 mm distal to the left subclavian arterial (LSCA) orifice on the lesser curvature side. Patient: So, what are my treatment options, doctor? Doctor: Well, PDA closure devices such as the Amplatzer duct occluder or coil embolization were considered too risky for your case. These percutaneous interventions have potential risks due to the friable tissue, aneurysmal change, calcification, and the morphology of the PDA, which may result in severe complications such as device migration, rupture, or residual shunt. Patient: Oh, that's concerning. Doctor: Open surgery is another option, but it also carries a high risk in your case because cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is required due to calcification. We decided that using a stent graft, usually used for treating thoracic aortic diseases, would be the best course of action for you. Patient: And how will the stent graft be inserted? Doctor: The procedure is called thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and will be performed in a catheterization lab. This minimally invasive procedure involves placing the stent graft within your aorta to seal off the PDA, reducing the risks associated with open surgery. Patient: That sounds like a better option. When can we schedule this procedure? Doctor: We can discuss the scheduling and further details with our team and get back to you soon. In the meantime, please avoid any strenuous activities to prevent exacerbation of your symptoms. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance. [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing joint discomfort, heart murmurs, and worsening shortness of breath, particularly during physical activities. No other symptoms were noted. O: The patient's height is 153 cm, and weight is 67 kg. Chest radiography indicated increased pulmonary vascular shadow and cardiomegaly. Electrocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) dilatation, LA volume at 85 mm, LV end diastolic dimension at 58 mm, dilated ascending aorta, mild aortic regurgitation, mild mitral valve regurgitation, and a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with a Qp/Qs ratio of 1.2. Contrast-enhanced 3D CT showed a conically shaped duct with calcification at the aortic end, measuring 14 mm in diameter, arising from the descending aorta, 30 mm distal to the left subclavian arterial (LSCA) orifice on the lesser curvature side. A: The primary diagnosis is a patent ductus arteriosus with associated complications including left atrial and ventricular dilatation, aortic and mitral valve regurgitations, and cardiomegaly. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of cardiomegaly and valve diseases, but these are less likely given the imaging findings and the presence of PDA. P: The management plan includes scheduling a thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) to address the PDA, using a stent graft. This procedure is chosen over PDA closure devices or open surgery due to lower associated risks given the patient's specific PDA morphology and calcification. The patient is advised to avoid strenuous activities until the procedure is performed to prevent exacerbation of symptoms. Further scheduling and details will be discussed with the team. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see in your report that you're a 70-year-old male patient who has presented with the chief complaint of dribbling watery secretions from your nasal mucosa when you think of or see food. Can you tell me more about this? Patient: Yes, doctor. Every time it happens, about 50-100 ml of watery fluid comes out of my nose. Doctor: I also see in your history that you've had hypertension for three years and type 2 diabetes mellitus for five years. Is there any history of neuro-degenerative disease in your family? Patient: No, doctor. There's no such history in my family. Doctor: Have you been experiencing any other symptoms, such as constipation or mucus in your stool? Patient: Hmm, yes. I've had constipation for about three months and I've noticed mucus in my stool. Doctor: I understand that you've had a colonoscopy performed, which didn't reveal any significant pathology. Have you experienced any dementia or psychiatric disturbances? Patient: No, I haven't had any issues like that. Doctor: What about sleep abnormalities, forward flex posture, or a broad-based gait? Have you noticed any of these symptoms? Patient: I do have some mild sleep abnormalities, and I've noticed a forward flex posture and a broad-based gait. Doctor: Based on your symptoms, I made a provisional diagnosis of gustatory rhinorrhea and advised you to take anti-cholinergic medications and anti-histamine drugs. Did you see any improvements with these medications? Patient: Not really, doctor. There was little to no benefit from those medications. Doctor: I also prescribed nasal corticosteroid sprays, mucolytic medications, and nasal irrigations. Did these prescriptions provide any symptomatic improvement? Patient: They helped a little bit, but the improvement was only mild. Doctor: I see that twenty-two months later, you presented again and had developed fine tremors in your fingers and hands. Were these tremors absent in your head and lower limbs? Patient: Yes, doctor. The tremors were only in my fingers and hands. Doctor: Were the tremors evident at rest or only during activity? Patient: The tremors were only evident at rest, not during activity. Doctor: Upon further examination, we noticed an altered sense of smell, which you hadn't noticed before. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. We started you on dopamine-based therapy, which should help improve both your rhinorrhea and motor symptoms. Have you noticed any improvements since starting this therapy? Patient: Yes, doctor. I've definitely seen an improvement in both my rhinorrhea and motor symptoms since starting the dopamine-based therapy. Doctor: That's great to hear. We'll continue to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment as necessary. If you have any concerns or notice any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Can you tell me more about any other symptoms you've experienced? Patient: Yeah, I've also had headaches and body weakness. I haven't had jaundice, though. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any vomiting or changes in your bowel movements? Patient: Yes, I've had several episodes of vomiting. It was initially not too bad, but later it became bilious. I also had diarrhea two days ago, but I haven't passed any stools today. Doctor: And did you notice any melena or hematochezia when you did have bowel movements? Patient: No, I didn't see anything like that. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Your parents mentioned that you've been passing scanty urine for about five days before coming here. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's true. Doctor: Alright. I also understand that you have been taking medications from the referring hospital for about two weeks. At presentation, you looked chronically ill with a toxic facie and were febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C. You appeared pale, dehydrated, and anicteric, with no pedal edema. Your respiratory rate was 28/minute, and we noticed reduced air entry on both lung bases posteriorly. Your pulse rate was 128/minute, but regular and of small volume. We could only hear the first and second heart sounds. Patient: Hmm, that doesn't sound too good. Doctor: Yes, it's concerning. Upon abdominal examination, we found your abdomen to be distended and not moving with respiration. You had generalized tenderness with guarding. The bowel sounds were absent. A digital rectal examination showed an empty rectum with a full and tender rectovesical pouch. Our initial assessment is that you have generalized peritonitis. Patient: Oh no, what do we do now? Doctor: We've placed you on NPO with a nasogastric tube for gastric decompression. We've also started you on IV fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, specifically ceftriaxone and metronidazole, as we work you up for surgery. Patient: Okay, what did the lab tests show? Doctor: Your initial laboratory investigations showed a hematocrit of 24%, hypokalemia (2.5 mmol/l), and a serum urea of 10 mmol/l. We've begun to address these issues with fluid resuscitation and correction of serum potassium. We also gave you a transfusion of 300 ml of whole blood. Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: Your exploratory laparotomy is scheduled for the second day of your stay here. We'll continue to monitor your condition and provide any necessary treatment in the meantime. Please let us know if you experience any changes in your symptoms. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. I appreciate the help. Doctor: You're welcome. We're here to help you get better. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.

Additional symptoms include headaches, body weakness, episodes of vomiting (initially mild, later bilious), and recent diarrhea. The patient denies jaundice, melena, or hematochezia. Notably, there has been a decrease in urine output over the past five days. O: On examination, the patient appeared chronically ill, toxic, febrile (38.5°C), pale, and dehydrated but anicteric with no pedal edema. Respiratory rate was elevated at 28/minute with reduced air entry bilaterally at lung bases. Pulse was tachycardic at 128/minute, regular, and of small volume. Abdominal examination revealed distension, generalized tenderness with guarding, absent bowel sounds, and a full, tender rectovesical pouch on digital rectal examination. Initial labs showed a hematocrit of 24%, hypokalemia (2.5 mmol/l), and serum urea of 10 mmol/l.  A: The primary diagnosis is generalized peritonitis. Differential diagnoses could include underlying causes of peritonitis such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or perforated bowel. The patient's symptoms and findings indicate a severe, acute abdominal condition requiring urgent surgical intervention. P: Management has included placing the patient on NPO with nasogastric tube insertion for gastric decompression, IV fluid resuscitation, and administration of broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (ceftriaxone and metronidazole). Correction of hypokalemia and anemia was initiated with potassium supplementation and transfusion of 300 ml of whole blood.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you have been referred to our clinic from a rural area in Syria. Can you tell me about your previous treatment for hydatid cysts in your lungs? Patient: Yes, I had a total open thoracic pericystectomy on both the right and left lobes of my lungs about a year ago. But the surgical management of the hydatid cyst in my liver was delayed. Doctor: I see. Have you had any other treatments for the liver cyst? Patient: Yeah, I've taken two shots of albendazole treatment so far. Doctor: Alright. Now, have you experienced any new symptoms recently? Patient: Yes, I have been having some pain in my abdomen. I think it might be related to gallstones. Doctor: That's possible. Our physical examination didn't reveal any other obvious findings. We have conducted an ultrasound and CT scan to get a better understanding of your condition. The ultrasound showed a cyst in the right lobe of your liver and gallbladder stones with no signs of inflammation. The abdominopelvic CT scan revealed a cystic mass of 5 × 4.5 cm2 with regular borders and minimal calcifications in the 6th segment of your liver, which is classified as a second degree in the Gharbi classification system. Patient: Oh, okay. So, what's the plan for my treatment? Doctor: We have discussed your case and decided that the best course of action would be to perform a lagrot partial pericystectomy and cholecystectomy at the same time. Patient: Why do both procedures at once? Doctor: The anatomical location of the hydatid liver cyst allows us to use the same ports for both procedures. We are also alerted to the risk of encountering adhesions in the surgical field if we were to delay one procedure to another operation scheduled later. By performing both procedures simultaneously, we can minimize these risks. Patient: I see. So, when can we schedule the surgery? Doctor: We will schedule the surgery as soon as possible and keep you informed about the date. In the meantime, please continue with your current treatment and let us know if you experience any changes in your symptoms. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you through this process. [/INST] S: The patient, previously treated for hydatid cysts in both lung lobes via open thoracic pericystectomy, reports delayed surgical management of a liver hydatid cyst. Currently, the patient is experiencing abdominal pain, suspected to be related to gallstones. O: Physical examination showed no significant findings. Ultrasound revealed a cyst in the right lobe of the liver and gallbladder stones without inflammation. Abdominopelvic CT scan identified a 5 × 4.5 cm2 cystic mass with regular borders and minimal calcifications in the liver's 6th segment, classified as Gharbi type II. The patient has been on albendazole treatment. A: Primary diagnosis is a hydatid cyst in the liver with concurrent gallstones. The location and characteristics of the liver cyst suggest a manageable condition with surgical intervention. The presence of gallstones without inflammation is noted but requires surgical address to prevent potential complications. P: Plan to perform a lagrot partial pericystectomy for the liver cyst and a simultaneous cholecystectomy to manage gallstones, utilizing the same surgical approach to minimize the risk of adhesions and complications. Surgery is scheduled as soon as possible. The patient is advised to continue current medication and report any new symptoms. Follow-up appointments will be arranged post-surgery to monitor recovery and manage any arising issues. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing epigastric pain since yesterday. It started about 15 minutes after I ate sushi. Doctor: I see. Have you had any nausea, diarrhea, or other symptoms? Patient: No, just the intermittent epigastric pain. Doctor: Are you currently pregnant or have any ongoing health conditions? Patient: Yes, I'm in early pregnancy, but there have been no abnormalities during the pregnancy so far. Doctor: Alright. Let me examine you. *checks for epigastric tenderness, rebound tenderness, and guarding* You have mild epigastric tenderness, but no rebound tenderness or guarding. We'll need to run some tests, such as laboratory work, an electrocardiogram, and abdominal ultrasonography to better understand your condition. Due to your pregnancy, we won't be doing radiography or computed tomography. Patient: Okay, that sounds fine. *After tests* Doctor: Your test results came back normal. Given your symptoms and the fact that you ate sushi prior to developing the pain, we suspect anisakiasis. We'll need to perform an esophagogastroduodenoscopy to confirm and potentially remove the foreign material. Patient: Alright, let's do it. *After esophagogastroduodenoscopy* Doctor: During the procedure, we found a linear foreign material stuck in the lesser curvature of the antrum. We carefully removed it with alligator forceps. There were no signs of bleeding or perforation, but we clipped the wound to be certain. We determined the foreign body to be a broken wooden toothpick, approximately 4 cm in length. Patient: Oh, wow! I'm glad it's out. Doctor: We recommend you be admitted to our hospital for observation. However, if you prefer not to, we can carefully conduct outpatient follow-up. Patient: I'd prefer not to be admitted, as long as it's safe. Doctor: Understood. We'll instruct you to fast for 1 day and then start a fluid diet from the second day onwards. Please return to our hospital in three days for a follow-up. *Three days later* Patient: I'm back for my follow-up appointment. I have no symptoms now. Doctor: That's great to hear! Since you're feeling better and have no symptoms, you may now return to eating regular meals. Be cautious about foreign objects in your food to prevent a similar incident in the future. Patient: Thank you, Doctor! I'll be more careful from now on. [/INST] S: The patient, a pregnant female, reports experiencing intermittent epigastric pain since yesterday, which began approximately 15 minutes after consuming sushi. She denies any associated nausea, diarrhea, or other symptoms. There have been no abnormalities reported during the current pregnancy. O: Physical examination revealed mild epigastric tenderness without rebound tenderness or guarding. Laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, and abdominal ultrasonography results were normal. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy identified and facilitated the removal of a linear foreign material, identified as a broken wooden toothpick, from the lesser curvature of the antrum. The procedure was completed without signs of bleeding or perforation, though the site was clipped as a precaution. A: The primary diagnosis is gastrointestinal foreign body (wooden toothpick) ingestion leading to epigastric pain. Differential diagnosis initially included anisakiasis due to recent sushi consumption, but this was ruled out following the esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The prognosis is good given the successful removal of the foreign body and the absence of complications during the procedure. P: The patient opted for outpatient management with instructions to fast for 1 day followed by a transition to a fluid diet starting the second day. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for three days post-procedure, during which the patient reported resolution of symptoms and was advised to resume regular meals. Continued outpatient follow-up and education on being cautious of foreign objects in food were recommended to prevent recurrence. </s>"

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really weak and pale for the past few days. I also had diarrhea for three days a couple of weeks ago. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. What about your past medical history? Do you have any family history of hematological problems or autoimmune disorders? Patient: No, not that I know of. My past medical history is unremarkable, and no one in my family has had any problems like that. Doctor: Alright, let's go ahead with the physical examination. I noticed that you have jaundice, pallor, and splenomegaly. Your heart rate is 125 beats/min, and there's a 2/6 systolic heart murmur present. We also conducted some laboratory tests, and here are the results: your hemoglobin is 5.1 g/dL, absolute reticulocyte count is 220 × 103/μL, mean corpuscular volume is 75 fl, white blood cells are 9.3 × 109/L, and platelets are 255 × 109/L. The peripheral blood film showed polychromasia and spherocytes without schistocytes. Patient: Oh, I see. What does that all mean, doc? Doctor: These results indicate that you have anemia. Your serum lactate dehydrogenase levels are 1540 U/L, total bilirubin is 3.8 mg/dl, and indirect bilirubin is 0.9 mg/dl. The renal and liver function tests showed that calcium and phosphate levels are normal. Urine examination was negative for hemoglobin and myoglobin. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was strongly positive for IgG autoantibodies with no fixation of the complement. Your antinuclear antibody and anti-deoxyribonucleic acid results were negative, and your serum C3, C4, IgG, IgM, and IgA levels were normal. Serology for cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and human immunodeficiency virus were also negative. Based on your symptoms, clinical findings, and laboratory tests, we have diagnosed that you have the warm type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Patient: Oh, okay. What's the treatment for that? Doctor: First, we administered an erythrocyte transfusion to address the severe anemia and avoid any cardiovascular compromise. We also started you on intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day for the first 72 hours, which has shown an excellent hematological response.  Patient: That's good to hear. What's the next step in my treatment? Doctor: Now that you're clinically stable, we'll switch to oral prednisolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day, which you'll need to take for 4 weeks. After that, we'll slowly taper the dosage during the following 5 months. This will help manage your AIHA. Patient: Got it, thank you so much for your help, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you through this process. Take care. [/INST] S: The patient presents with a five-day history of weakness and pallor, and a recent episode of diarrhea lasting three days. The patient denies any significant past medical or family history of hematological or autoimmune disorders. O: Physical examination reveals jaundice, pallor, and splenomegaly. Heart rate is elevated at 125 beats/min with a 2/6 systolic heart murmur. Laboratory findings include hemoglobin at 5.1 g/dL, absolute reticulocyte count at 220 × 10^3/μL, mean corpuscular volume at 75 fl, white blood cells at 9.3 × 10^9/L, and platelets at 255 × 10^9/L. Peripheral blood film shows polychromasia and spherocytes without schistocytes. Serum lactate dehydrogenase is elevated at 1540 U/L, total bilirubin at 3.8 mg/dL, and indirect bilirubin at 0.9 mg/dL. Direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is strongly positive for IgG autoantibodies. Renal and liver function tests are normal, and serology for various infections is negative. A: The patient is diagnosed with warm type autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), evidenced by anemia, positive DAT, and exclusion of other causes through comprehensive testing. P: Initial management included an erythrocyte transfusion and intravenous methylprednisolone at 3 mg/kg/day for 72 hours, showing good hematological response. The patient is now transitioning to oral prednisolone at 2 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, with a planned gradual taper over the following 5 months. Regular follow-up and monitoring of hematological parameters are scheduled to assess response to treatment and adjust as necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see from your history that you have type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi Doctor, I've been having increasing diplopia and nausea for the past six days. I've also lost about 10 pounds unintentionally in the last two weeks. Doctor: I see. Let me perform a physical exam to check for any abnormalities.  *After the physical exam* Doctor: Your physical exam revealed some bony tenderness localized to the ribs and a right CN VI palsy, which is causing impaired right eye abduction. The remainder of the exam was unremarkable. We'll need to run some tests to better understand your condition. *After the tests* Doctor: Your hemogram with differential showed a white count of 10,700 k/µL, which is slightly elevated. Your absolute neutrophil count was also high at 7.5 k/µL. However, your absolute lymphocyte count was within normal limits at 2.42 k/µL. Patient: Okay, what about my blood chemistry? Doctor: Your blood chemistry showed some abnormalities. Your serum Ca2+ was elevated at 15.8 mg/dL, and your ionized Ca2+ was also high at 7.7 mg/dL. Your glucose level was 254 mg/dL, which is above the normal range as well. Patient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good. What about my parathyroid hormone levels? Doctor: Your parathyroid hormone was actually low at <10 pg/mL, and your parathyroid hormone-related peptide was normal at 1.3. Patient: Did you check my urine as well? Doctor: Yes, we performed a urine analysis and urine protein electrophoresis. Both were unremarkable and showed no evidence of Bence-Jones protein. Patient: What about the protein levels in my blood? Doctor: Your total protein was 6.8 g/dL, and your serum globulin was 2.8 g/dL. This resulted in a protein gap of 4.0 g/dL. Your albumin/gamma globulin ratio was elevated at 2.4. Patient: Did you find anything else in my blood tests? Doctor: Yes, serum protein electrophoresis revealed a faint monoclonal immunoglobulin. Serum immune-quantification showed IgG at 1150 mg/dL, IgA at 200 mg/dL, and IgM at 41. Patient: What does all this mean, Doctor? Doctor: These findings indicate that we need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms and the abnormalities in your blood tests. It's important that we monitor your condition closely and consider additional testing or specialist consultations as needed. In the meantime, please continue to manage your type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypothyroidism as prescribed by your primary care physician. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypothyroidism, presents with increasing diplopia and nausea over the past six days and unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds in the last two weeks. O: Physical examination revealed bony tenderness at the ribs and right CN VI palsy causing impaired right eye abduction. Hemogram showed a slightly elevated white count at 10,700 k/µL and absolute neutrophil count at 7.5 k/µL. Blood chemistry indicated hypercalcemia with serum Ca2+ at 15.8 mg/dL and ionized Ca2+ at 7.7 mg/dL, and elevated glucose level at 254 mg/dL. Parathyroid hormone was low at <10 pg/mL. Urine analysis and protein electrophoresis were unremarkable. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a faint monoclonal immunoglobulin, and serum immune-quantification showed IgG at 1150 mg/dL, IgA at 200 mg/dL, and IgM at 41 mg/dL. A: The primary concerns are hypercalcemia and potential monoclonal gammopathy, which may suggest multiple myeloma or another hematologic condition. The right CN VI palsy and bony tenderness could be related to underlying systemic disease. Differential diagnoses include hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, or other systemic disorders affecting bone metabolism and neurological function. P: Plan to manage the patient includes further diagnostic testing such as bone marrow biopsy, skeletal survey, or CT scans to assess for possible myeloma or malignancies. Referral to an endocrinologist for management of hypercalcemia and a hematologist for evaluation of potential monoclonal gammopathy is indicated. Continue management of chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism) as previously prescribed. Educate the patient on the importance of monitoring symptoms and adhering to follow-up appointments. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 37-year-old homeless male with a past medical history of peripheral vascular disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and depression. What brings you to the emergency department today? Patient: Well, I've been having intermittent chest pain and progressive shortness of breath for a few weeks now. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been using any intravenous drugs recently? Patient: No, but I admit I've been using marijuana recreationally. Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Your vitals on admission are stable except for your low saturation on a pulse oximetry of 86% on room air. During your physical examination, I noticed you're breathing quite fast and I heard fine crackles in the bilateral lung fields when I listened to your chest. We've also run some lab tests. Patient: What did the tests show? Doctor: Your normal complete blood count and basic metabolic panel came back normal, but your urine drug screen test was positive for opioids. We also checked your D-Dimer levels due to your persistent low oxygen levels, and it came back highly elevated. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It means we needed to rule out a pulmonary embolism, so you underwent a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of your chest. The CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism, but it showed extensive miliary densities throughout the bilateral lung fields. At this point, we're considering a diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis or a fungal infection. Patient: Did you test me for those? Doctor: Yes, we tested for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), fungal and Quantiferron tests, but they all came back negative. We also looked into cardiac workup and autoimmune serology, which were unremarkable. Patient: So, what are you doing to help me? Doctor: We started you on intravenous steroids and inhaled albuterol, but unfortunately, we haven't seen any improvement. You remained hypoxemic despite the therapy, so we decided to perform a bronchoscopy with a lung biopsy to further investigate the disease process. Patient: What did the biopsy show? Doctor: The lung biopsy showed a miliary pattern of perivascular foreign body histiocytes containing refractory material, suggestive of microcrystalline cellulose material. There was no evidence of malignancy, and no fungal or acid-fast bacilli organisms were identified on special stains. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: It suggests that you may have been injecting oral opiates, which could be the cause of the foreign material in your lungs. Is this something you have done? Patient: Yes, I admit to doing that. Doctor: Thank you for being honest. We've continued you on intravenous steroids, but your condition has unfortunately declined. You've developed hypercapnic respiratory failure. Patient's family (at the end of the conversation): Thank you, doctor, for your efforts and updating us on his condition. We appreciate all that has been done to help him. [/INST] S: The patient is a 37-year-old homeless male with a history of peripheral vascular disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and depression, presenting with intermittent chest pain and progressive shortness of breath over a few weeks. He denies recent intravenous drug use but admits to recreational marijuana and injecting oral opiates. He reports no improvement with current treatments. O: On examination, the patient was found to have low oxygen saturation at 86% on room air, tachypnea, and bilateral fine crackles in the lung fields. Vital signs were otherwise stable. Lab tests showed a normal complete blood count and basic metabolic panel. The urine drug screen was positive for opioids. D-Dimer levels were highly elevated. CTA of the chest ruled out pulmonary embolism but revealed extensive miliary densities. HIV, fungal, and Quantiferron tests were negative. Cardiac workup and autoimmune serology were unremarkable. A lung biopsy indicated a miliary pattern of perivascular foreign body histiocytes with microcrystalline cellulose material, with no evidence of malignancy, fungal, or acid-fast bacilli. A: The primary diagnosis is respiratory failure due to pulmonary microcrystalline cellulose embolism, likely secondary to injecting oral opiates. Differential diagnoses such as miliary tuberculosis, fungal infection, and pulmonary embolism have been ruled out. The prognosis is guarded given the progression to hypercapnic respiratory failure despite treatment. P: The patient is currently on intravenous steroids and inhaled albuterol, which have not improved his condition. Given the diagnosis, the management plan will continue supportive care and address the underlying cause by discontinuing the injection of oral opiates. A psychiatric consultation is recommended to address substance abuse and underlying depression. Education regarding the risks of injecting oral medications and substance abuse will be provided. Close monitoring in the ICU for respiratory support and potential escalation of care is necessary. Family has been updated on his condition and management plan. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a 4-month history of severe lower back pain. Can you tell me if you've experienced any fever, trauma, weight loss, or previous infections during this time? Patient: No, I haven't had any fever, trauma, weight loss, or infections. Doctor: Alright, thank you. We conducted a radiographic analysis which showed collapse of the left side of your L3 vertebral body and swelling of the iliopsoas muscle. We also performed spinal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The CT revealed an osteolytic lesion involving the L3 vertebral body and surrounding soft tissue, causing vertebral body collapse. The MRI showed the tumor extending toward the left side of the paravertebral soft tissue and into the left pedicle. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it is concerning. We also conducted pathological and immunohistochemical analyses of a needle biopsy specimen. The results showed a giant cell tumor (GCT) with multinucleate giant cells surrounded by neoplastic stromal cells. Patient: What does that mean for me, doctor? Doctor: We decided to enroll you in a phase 2 trial for denosumab treatment. Thankfully, you experienced no adverse effects or complications. We prescribed you six cycles of monthly subcutaneous injections of 120-mg denosumab. The lumbar CT during your treatment showed that the tumor included a paravertebral lesion with progressive calcification. Patient: Alright, so what's the next step? Doctor: Next, we performed a two-stage L3 total en bloc spondylectomy (TES). Stage 1 utilized a posterior approach for resecting the posterior vertebral component. This operation took 5 hours 16 minutes, and the total bleeding was 1520 ml. Patient: Oh wow, that was a long surgery. Doctor: Yes, it was. Stage 2 utilized an anterior retroperitoneal approach for resecting the anterior vertebral component, followed by intervertebral cage insertion. This operation took 6 hours 43 minutes, and the total bleeding was 2320 ml. Patient: That's even longer. How did it go? Doctor: The day before the second-stage operation, we performed preoperative angiography and segmental artery embolization from L3 to L4 to reduce intraoperative bleeding. The vertebral body was completely removed after the discectomies, and the bilateral psoas muscle was released from the L3 vertebral body. Patient: So, is the tumor gone now? Doctor: Yes, the tumor has been removed, and we will continue to monitor your progress closely. It is important for you to attend follow-up appointments to ensure your recovery goes smoothly. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate the care you and the team have provided. Doctor: You're welcome. We're here to help, and we'll continue to support you through your recovery. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. [/INST] S: The patient reports a 4-month history of severe lower back pain. Denies any associated fever, trauma, weight loss, or previous infections. O: Radiographic analysis revealed collapse of the left L3 vertebral body and swelling of the iliopsoas muscle. CT scan showed an osteolytic lesion involving the L3 vertebral body and surrounding soft tissue. MRI indicated tumor extension toward the left side of the paravertebral soft tissue and into the left pedicle. Pathological and immunohistochemical analysis of a needle biopsy specimen confirmed a giant cell tumor (GCT). Recent treatment included six cycles of 120-mg subcutaneous denosumab injections monthly, with no adverse effects. Lumbar CT post-treatment showed progressive calcification of the paravertebral lesion. Surgical intervention involved a two-stage L3 total en bloc spondylectomy (TES), with significant operative times and blood loss reported. A: Primary diagnosis of giant cell tumor (GCT) of the L3 vertebral body. The patient underwent pharmacological treatment with denosumab followed by surgical resection of the tumor. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic, pending close monitoring and follow-up. P: Continue close monitoring and regular follow-up appointments to assess recovery and detect any recurrence early. Emphasize the importance of adherence to follow-up schedules. Provide patient education on signs of complications or recurrence.

Doctor: What brings you to the emergency department today? Patient: I've been feeling weak and lightheaded with shortness of breath for two days. I had dialysis yesterday, but I didn't feel better. I also developed central chest pain at rest about four to five hours ago, and it gets worse with deep breaths. Doctor: I understand. I see that you were seen at an outside hospital and were told you had a pericardial effusion. They sent you here for a higher level of care. Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Let me go over some of your vitals. Your blood pressure is 124/89 mmHg, heart rate is 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 18 per minute, oral temperature is 37.4° centigrade, and oxygen saturation is 93% on room air. Your body mass index is 23 kg/m2. Your physical exam showed warm and dry skin, normal mentation, and no audible murmur. However, there was jugular venous distention when you were sitting up at 90 degrees. You didn't have any rales of pulmonary congestion or leg edema, and you didn't complain of any pain. Patient: Okay, that's a lot of info. Doctor: We performed a POCUS and it didn't reveal any circumferential or dependent effusion or tamponade physiology. But it did show an enlarged right ventricle, with a thickened intraventricular septum, which is suspicious for right heart strain. Patient: Oh, I see. What's next? Doctor: We'll conduct some laboratory studies, an electrocardiogram, an anterior-posterior portable chest radiograph, and a computed tomography angiography to assess for any other potential issues, including PE. Patient: Got it. Doctor: In the meantime, we've given you aspirin and unfractionated heparin bolus and drip per cardiology recommendations, pending the CTA results. Patient: Alright. Doctor: The CTA, which was done a few hours after your presentation to the ED, revealed a loculated anterior pericardial effusion. We'll admit you to the coronary care unit for further evaluation and treatment. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate the care. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of hypertension, end-stage renal disease on dialysis, thrombotic stroke, and tobacco use, presents with a two-day history of weakness, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath, which persisted post-dialysis.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi doctor, I've been having this progressive headache for the past 3 years, and it's getting worse. I'm also having trouble speaking lately. Doctor: I see, I'm sorry to hear that. We should do an MRI of your brain to check for any abnormalities.  (After the MRI) Doctor: Based on the MRI results, we discovered 4 masses in your brain, including 2 dominant mass lesions measuring 6.0 and 4.5 cm with irregular lobulations in the bilateral temporal lobes. These findings are consistent with metastatic disease. Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What does it mean? Doctor: It means that the masses in your brain could be related to a cancer that has spread from another part of your body. I see in your past medical history that you had a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, peritoneal washing, and pelvic lymph node samplings performed twice, 8 and 4 years prior, respectively. Both specimens had serous borderline tumors, one of which had a 1 mm focus of microinvasion. Patient: Yes, that's correct. So, could these brain masses be related to those ovarian tumors? Doctor: It's a possibility. We took a fluid sample from the current cystic mass in your brain and found neoplastic cells forming papillary clusters with smooth contoured edges on the smear. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: We also analyzed a tissue sample of the brain lesion. It showed clusters of broad papillae with hierarchical branching and is lined by polygonal to columnar serous epithelium with mild to moderate atypia. Patient: Hmm, I don't understand all that, doctor. Doctor: That's alright. We performed immunohistochemical staining on the samples as well. The results showed positive staining for PAX 8, WT-1, and CK7 and negative staining for CK20. Patient: And what does that mean? Doctor: These morphologic features and immunoprofile findings are in keeping with a diagnosis of your previous ovarian tumor. This suggests that the masses in your brain might be related to the ovarian tumors you had in the past. Patient: Oh, I see. So, what's the next step, doctor? Doctor: We will need to discuss your treatment options and closely monitor your condition. The team will work together to come up with the best plan for you. We'll keep you and your family informed and involved in the decision-making process. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and explanation. [/INST] S: The patient reports a progressive headache worsening over the past 3 years and recent difficulty with speech. She has a history of unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, peritoneal washing, and pelvic lymph node sampling due to serous borderline ovarian tumors, one with a microinvasion. O: MRI of the brain revealed four masses, including two dominant lesions in the bilateral temporal lobes measuring 6.0 and 4.5 cm with irregular lobulations, suggestive of metastatic disease. Fluid and tissue samples from a brain cystic mass showed neoplastic cells forming papillary clusters and broad papillae with hierarchical branching, lined by serous epithelium with mild to moderate atypia. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for PAX 8, WT-1, and CK7, and negative for CK20, consistent with metastasis from the patient's known ovarian tumor. A: Primary diagnosis is metastatic brain tumors, likely secondary to previously treated ovarian serous borderline tumors. Differential diagnosis could include primary brain tumors or other metastatic cancers, but the immunohistochemical profile supports the ovarian origin. P: Plan to discuss treatment options including possible surgical intervention, radiation, or chemotherapy tailored to the metastatic nature of the brain lesions. Close monitoring of neurological status and regular follow-up MRI scans will be necessary. Referral to an oncologist for management of systemic disease and a neurosurgeon for evaluation of potential surgical intervention. Patient education regarding prognosis, treatment options, and potential side effects will be provided to ensure informed decision-making. Family involvement in discussions and decision-making process will be encouraged to support the patient. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Good morning, sir. I understand you have a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and angina. Can you tell me about your current symptoms? Patient: Good morning, doc. Yeah, I've been feeling really weak and lethargic lately. I also have cold intolerance, weight loss, and loss of appetite. Doctor: I see. Are you a smoker? Patient: Yes, I've been smoking a half-pack per day for 47 years. Doctor: Alright. Can you tell me when these symptoms started? Patient: Hmm, I think about one and a half months prior to my admission here. I became really lethargic and lost my appetite. I lost about 7 kg in just one month. Doctor: That's quite a significant weight loss. On the day of your admission, how were you feeling? Patient: I couldn't even move because of my overall weakness and lethargy. My family had to transfer me to your hospital. Doctor: When you arrived at the hospital, were you conscious and oriented? Patient: Yes, I was. Doctor: I see that your blood pressure was low (104/70 mmHg) compared to your previous hypertension, and your blood glucose was also low (64 mg/dl). Your body temperature was 35.8 °C, heart rate 60 beats/min, and respiratory rate 20 breaths/min. Did you notice any conjunctival pallor or thyromegaly? Patient: No, I didn't notice anything like that. Doctor: Your cardiac and pulmonary examination results were normal, other than a positive tilt test. On your neurological examination, there were no visual defects and your higher cognitive functions were normal. We also conducted some laboratory studies. Your complete blood count and coagulation were normal. Patient: Okay, that's good to hear. Doctor: Your biochemistry tests showed a sodium level of 134 mEq/L, which is slightly below the reference range of 135-147 mEq/L, and hypoglycemia. However, your other electrolytes were within normal limits. We also checked your thyroid levels. Your thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 0.505 μIU/ml, free thyroxine (FT4) was 0.61 ng/dl, and free triiodothyronine was 1.67 ng/dl. These levels are outside the reference ranges. Patient: What does that mean, doc? Doctor: These results suggest that your thyroid function may be contributing to your symptoms. We also performed an electrocardiogram, which showed a sinus bradycardiac rhythm. This means your heart rate is slower than normal. Patient: Oh, I see. What should we do now, doc? Doctor: We'll need to further investigate your thyroid function and consider appropriate treatment options based on the findings. In the meantime, we'll closely monitor your blood pressure, blood glucose, and other vitals. We'll also provide you with guidance on managing your symptoms and improving your overall health. Please make sure to follow up with us as instructed. Patient: Alright, thank you, doc. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to help you feel better. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. [/INST] S: The patient, a 67-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and angina, presents with symptoms of weakness, lethargy, cold intolerance, weight loss, and loss of appetite starting approximately 1.5 months ago. He reports a significant weight loss of 7 kg over one month. The patient is a long-term smoker, consuming half a pack per day for 47 years. O: Upon admission, the patient was conscious and oriented. Vital signs showed hypotension (104/70 mmHg), hypoglycemia (blood glucose 64 mg/dl), hypothermia (body temperature 35.8 °C), bradycardia (heart rate 60 beats/min), and normal respiratory rate (20 breaths/min). The cardiac and pulmonary examinations were normal except for a positive tilt test. Neurological examination showed no visual defects or cognitive impairments. Laboratory tests revealed mild hyponatremia (sodium 134 mEq/L), and thyroid function tests indicated low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH 0.505 μIU/ml), low free thyroxine (FT4 0.61 ng/dl), and low free triiodothyronine (1.67 ng/dl). An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia. A: The primary diagnosis is hypothyroidism, likely contributing to the patient's symptoms of lethargy, weakness, cold intolerance, and metabolic disturbances (hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, bradycardia). Differential diagnoses could include adrenal insufficiency and secondary infections, considering the patient's complex medical history and significant smoking habit. P: The management plan will focus on further evaluation and treatment of the patient's thyroid function, including possible thyroid hormone replacement therapy after endocrinology consultation. Monitoring of vital signs, especially blood pressure and blood glucose, will continue. The patient will receive dietary guidance to manage weight loss and nutritional deficiencies.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of morbid obesity and tricuspid valve endocarditis with mechanical TV replacement. How have you been feeling lately? Patient: Not too good, doc. I stopped taking Coumadin for a week now, and I've been experiencing worsening dyspnea, facial cyanosis, marked lower extremity edema, and increased abdominal girth. Doctor: I see. I'm going to perform a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to get a better understanding of your condition. These tests show significant tricuspid valve thrombosis with severely immobile leaflets and severe pulmonary hypertension. Patient: Oh no, that sounds terrible. What are we going to do about it? Doctor: We'll start by giving you a high-intensity heparin infusion with an 8000U bolus, followed by a 1800U per hour infusion. We'll also bring you to the interventional laboratory where we'll advance a 7-French triple-lumen central venous catheter to your right atrium via the right internal jugular vein under fluoroscopic guidance. Patient: Okay, and then what? Doctor: Once the catheter is in place, we'll deliver a bolus of 2 mg of alteplase (tPA) followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/hour for 24 hours. Fluoroscopy reveals that your tricuspid valve has severely reduced mobility. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: It means that the gradient across your tricuspid valve is above 20 mmHg and your right atrial pressure is elevated at 22 mmHg. We'll reassess the gradients 24 hours later, and if the TV gradient remains elevated above 20 mmHg, with severely elevated central venous pressure and a markedly reduced cardiac index, we'll proceed with further treatment. Patient: What would that treatment be? Doctor: You would undergo redo sternotomy with redo tricuspid valve replacement using a porcine bioprosthesis. Patient: And how will my recovery be after that? Doctor: Your postoperative course should be uneventful. We'll restart you on coumadin and bridge you with heparin infusion during your recovery. Once your INR is at 2.6, we'll discharge you home. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help in getting me better. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of morbid obesity and tricuspid valve endocarditis with mechanical tricuspid valve replacement, reports stopping Coumadin for a week. He presents with worsening dyspnea, facial cyanosis, marked lower extremity edema, and increased abdominal girth. O: Physical examination and imaging (transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography) reveal significant tricuspid valve thrombosis with severely immobile leaflets and severe pulmonary hypertension. Right atrial pressure is elevated at 22 mmHg, and the gradient across the tricuspid valve is above 20 mmHg. A 7-French triple-lumen central venous catheter was placed in the right atrium via the right internal jugular vein under fluoroscopic guidance. A: The primary diagnosis is mechanical tricuspid valve thrombosis with severe pulmonary hypertension, likely exacerbated by non-compliance with anticoagulation therapy (Coumadin). Differential diagnoses could include exacerbation of heart failure or pulmonary embolism. P: Initiated high-intensity heparin infusion with an 8000U bolus followed by 1800U per hour. Administered a bolus of 2 mg of alteplase (tPA) followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/hour for 24 hours. Plan to reassess tricuspid valve gradients and central venous pressure after 24 hours.

Postoperative management will include restarting Coumadin, bridging with heparin, and monitoring INR levels until stable at 2.6 for discharge. Education on the importance of medication compliance and regular follow-up appointments will be emphasized. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I understand you've been suffering from fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. Is that correct? Patient: Yeah, it's been pretty awful. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. When were you admitted to the Health Sciences Center of the University of Oklahoma? Patient: In 2014, when I was just 2 months old. Doctor: I see. We performed blood tests immediately upon your admission. Your hemoglobin level was 9.6 g/L, leukocyte count was 33.1 × 109 cells/L with neutrophils at 6%, lymphocytes at 33%, monocytes at 7%, and blast cells at 50%. Your platelet count was 186 × 109 cells/L. Patient: Oh, okay. Doctor: We also performed a bone marrow aspiration which showed that your bone marrow was hypercellular with 50% blast cells. The leukemic cells were negative for both myeloperoxidase and Sudan black B. Patient: I see. Doctor: Flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis of the leukemic cells showed that they were CD19(+), CD34(+), CD38(+), HLDR (+), moderately CD45(+), and partially CD15(+). There was no co-expression of CD10, CD20, surface immunoglobulin, CD13, CD33, CD117, or T-cell markers. No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly was observed. Patient: Alright. Doctor: Based on these laboratory findings, you were diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), pre-B phenotype. After your relapse, we repeated the flow cytometric analysis and found similar marker patterns as before. Patient: I understand. Doctor: We also conducted chromosome analysis of your bone marrow sample, which showed a 3-way translocation t (4;11;11) (q21;q23;p11.2). This resulted from translocation of the chromosome 4q21 segment to 11q23 and juxtaposition of the 11p11.2 segment to 4q21 (Fig. A). One of the two chromosome 11s had two breakpoints, with one on each arm. Breakpoints at 4q21 and 11q23 prompted us to search further. Patient: So what does this all mean for me, doc? Doctor: The chromosome abnormalities and the immunophenotypic results help us understand the nature of your leukemia and guide the appropriate treatment options. It's important to closely monitor your condition and follow the recommended treatment plan. Patient: Okay, I'll do my best to follow the plan. Doctor: That's great. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help you through this journey. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your support.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you presented to a local hospital with upper and lower extremity motor disturbances back in 2014. Can you tell me more about that? Patient: Yeah, I had some weakness and numbness in my arms and legs. They did some tests and found a mild reduction in my nerve conduction velocity. They diagnosed me with polyneuropathy. Doctor: I understand. In 2016, you experienced 3 episodes of pleurisy with fever, with a body temperature greater than 38°C, occurring at 2-month intervals. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. It was quite painful and the fever was pretty high. Doctor: I see that you were referred to our hospital in June 2017 because you tested positive for both myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA and proteinase-3 (PR3)-ANCA. Are you aware of your family medical history? Patient: My family history is unremarkable. I don't drink, but I have smoked 20 cigarettes a day for 25 years. Doctor: I also see that you have been taking 50 mg/day of losartan and 5 mg/day of amlodipine for hypertension. Since 2006, you've been treated with 100 mg/day of PTU for hyperthyroidism. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: During your first visit to our hospital, we conducted a laboratory test which showed the following results: white blood cell count at 3980/μL, C-reactive protein (CRP) at 1.39 mg/dL, MPO-ANCA at 10.20 EU/L, and PR3-ANCA at 6.76 EU/L. We suspected PTU-associated AAV, so we discontinued your PTU treatment. How did you feel after discontinuing PTU? Patient: Well, the CRP levels normalized, but the numbness in my limbs didn't improve. Doctor: In November 2017, you were admitted to our hospital with chest pain and high fever. Your body temperature was 37.8°C and your blood pressure was 158/109 mm Hg. Can you describe your state of consciousness at that time? Patient: I was fully conscious and aware of everything happening around me. Doctor: Did you have any neurological, respiratory, or abdominal involvement during that time? Patient: No, I didn't experience any issues with those. Doctor: Were you experiencing any pleural friction rubs, or unusual sounds when you breathed? Patient: No, I didn't notice any strange sounds. Doctor: How was your manual muscle strength at that time? Patient: It was normal, I didn't have any issues with my muscle strength. Doctor: During your admission, we conducted another laboratory test. The findings were as follows: white blood cell count at 6760/μL, CRP at 8.65 mg/dL, creatine kinase at 512 U/L, PR3-ANCA at 6.88 IU/mL, and MPO-ANCA at 12.7 IU/mL. We also performed a computed tomography scan. Based on these results, we will continue to monitor your condition and work on a treatment plan to address your symptoms. Please make sure to come in for regular follow-up appointments and let us know if your symptoms worsen or if you experience any new symptoms. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and will make sure to follow your instructions. [/INST] S: The patient reported experiencing weakness and numbness in the arms and legs since 2014, diagnosed as polyneuropathy. He also had three episodes of pleurisy with fever in 2016. The patient has a history of smoking 20 cigarettes a day for 25 years, hypertension treated with losartan and amlodipine, and hyperthyroidism treated with PTU until it was discontinued due to suspected PTU-associated AAV. The numbness in limbs persisted despite normalization of CRP levels after discontinuing PTU. No neurological, respiratory, or abdominal issues were reported during the last hospital admission. O: Initial tests showed mild reduction in nerve conduction velocity. Recent labs indicated WBC at 6760/μL, CRP at 8.65 mg/dL, creatine kinase at 512 U/L, PR3-ANCA at 6.88 IU/mL, and MPO-ANCA at 12.7 IU/mL. CT scan was performed, details of which were not disclosed. Previous vital signs included a high fever and hypertension (158/109 mm Hg). A: The primary diagnosis is PTU-associated ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), considering the history of PTU use and positive ANCA tests. Differential diagnoses could include ongoing polyneuropathy and recurrent pleurisy episodes. The prognosis depends on the response to discontinuation of PTU and further management of AAV and polyneuropathy. P: Discontinue PTU and monitor ANCA levels and CRP closely. Continue antihypertensive medications (losartan 50 mg/day, amlodipine 5 mg/day). Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to assess the progression of symptoms and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Educate the patient on the importance of smoking cessation to improve overall health and potentially better manage AAV. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see from your chart that you are a 64-year-old male patient with a history of diabetes for 18 years. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been having a fever and burning micturition lately. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any back pain or additional symptoms? Patient: Yes, I've been having some back pain along with the fever. Doctor: Given your symptoms and history, I suspect you might have pyelonephritis. We'll need to run some tests to confirm this. We'll start with an ultrasound and some blood tests. *After tests* Doctor: Your ultrasound imaging showed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, and your laboratory investigation revealed an increased white blood cell count. We need to do an MRI to further investigate the cause of the bilateral hydronephrosis. *After MRI* Doctor: The MRI evaluation showed filling defects in the calyces of both kidneys. Additionally, your right kidney showed a thin rim of parenchymal diffusion restriction with diffusion restriction of the calyces and the tip of the medullary pyramids in both kidneys. This suggests a possibility of early right-sided pyelonephritis and a diagnosis of bilateral papillary necrosis. Other features of papillary necrosis, such as filling defects, clefts, and phantom calyces, were also seen. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What's the next step? Doctor: We performed a urine culture, which demonstrated the growth of Escherichia coli. To treat this, you'll need to undergo bilateral ureteric stenting followed by a course of antibiotics. Patient: Alright, if that's what it takes to get better. *After treatment* Doctor: Your treatment seems to have been successful. There has been an improvement in your symptoms, and your routine urine examination and urine culture have returned to normal. Patient: That's great to hear! I'm feeling much better now. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. It's important to note that all patients in this series, including you, had elevated creatinine levels which prevented the use of intravenous urography or contrast-enhanced CT or MR urography. However, the MRI provided valuable information by imaging the urine-filled ureter. Patient: So using MRI was the best option for my case? Doctor: Yes, at our institution, we've found that MRI is an effective imaging method for patients like you with elevated creatinine levels. Patient: Thank you for helping me through this, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. Please be vigilant about any changes in your symptoms and keep up with your diabetes management. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to contact us. [/INST] S: 64-year-old male with a history of diabetes for 18 years presents with recent symptoms of fever, burning micturition, and back pain. O: Physical examination and diagnostic tests were conducted. Ultrasound imaging revealed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis. Blood tests indicated an elevated white blood cell count. MRI showed filling defects in the calyces of both kidneys, a thin rim of parenchymal diffusion restriction in the right kidney, and diffusion restriction of the calyces and the tip of the medullary pyramids in both kidneys, suggesting early right-sided pyelonephritis and bilateral papillary necrosis. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli. Post-treatment urine examination and culture returned to normal. A: The primary diagnosis is bilateral papillary necrosis and right-sided pyelonephritis secondary to Escherichia coli infection, complicated by the patient's long-standing diabetes. Differential diagnosis included other causes of hydronephrosis which were ruled out by imaging and laboratory findings. P: The patient underwent bilateral ureteric stenting and was treated with a course of antibiotics. Follow-up included routine urine examination and culture, which normalized post-treatment. The patient was advised to monitor any changes in symptoms and to manage his diabetes vigilantly. MRI was utilized as the primary imaging modality due to elevated creatinine levels, avoiding the use of contrast-enhanced imaging techniques. The patient was instructed to contact healthcare providers if symptoms reoccur or new symptoms appear. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you were admitted to the emergency department for a hypoglycemic attack. How are you feeling now? Patient: I'm feeling a bit better, but still a little weak. Doctor: During your stay in the emergency department, a computed tomography (CT) scan detected a large tumor in your pelvic cavity. You were referred to our hospital for a closer examination. Do you have any relevant medical history or ongoing medications? Patient: No, I don't have any medical history and I'm not taking any medications. Doctor: Alright. On admission, we found that your blood glucose level was 52 mg/dl, which is below the normal range of 70-109 mg/dl. Your serum insulin level was 1.0 μIU/ml, C-peptide level was 0.2 ng/ml, and IGF-I level was 31 ng/ml. All of these are also below their normal ranges. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We conducted a contrast-enhanced CT scan, which indicated a heterogeneous spheroid mass with little contrast-enhancement, measuring 13 × 9 × 11 cm in your pelvic cavity. CT-angiography revealed the presence of feeding vessels branching from the right and left internal iliac arteries. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It means that the tumor is being supplied by blood vessels from both sides of your pelvic area. We also performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which showed a lobulated tumor with mixed intensity areas in both T1- and T2-weighted images. Fortunately, there was no clear invasion to any adjacent organs identified. Patient: That's a relief, I guess. Doctor: Yes, it's a positive sign. We also did a positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan, which revealed heterogeneous accumulation on the tumor with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 2.5. Patient: So, what's the plan now, doc? Doctor: Due to the hypoglycemia, we had to start you on continuous glucose infusion. We also initiated glucocorticoid administration prior to tumor resection. Patient: Okay, and how did the tumor resection go? Doctor: The operation was successful. The tumor was located retroperitoneally, fed by the superior vesical artery, and was completely excised. The operation time was 388 minutes, and the intraoperative blood loss was 1410 ml. Patient: That sounds intense, but I'm glad it's over. Doctor: Yes, it was a challenging procedure, but the good news is that the tumor has been removed. Macroscopically, the tumor was solid, composed of partially necrotic grayish-white tissue, measuring 15 × 8 × 8 cm, and had a fibrous capsule. We'll be analyzing the tumor under the microscope to learn more about it. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all your efforts. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your condition and provide any necessary follow-up care. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. [/INST] S: The patient was admitted to the emergency department for a hypoglycemic attack, presenting with a blood glucose level of 52 mg/dl. The patient reports feeling a bit better but still weak. No relevant medical history or ongoing medications were reported. O: Vital signs were not specified. Blood glucose was 52 mg/dl (normal range 70-109 mg/dl). Serum insulin level was 1.0 μIU/ml, C-peptide level was 0.2 ng/ml, and IGF-I level was 31 ng/ml, all below normal ranges. Imaging included a CT scan revealing a large heterogeneous spheroid mass in the pelvic cavity measuring 13 × 9 × 11 cm, with feeding vessels from both right and left internal iliac arteries. MRI showed a lobulated tumor with mixed intensity areas, no invasion to adjacent organs. PET-CT showed heterogeneous accumulation with SUVmax of 2.5. Tumor resection was performed, removing a retroperitoneal tumor fed by the superior vesical artery, measuring 15 × 8 × 8 cm with a fibrous capsule. A: Primary diagnosis is a large pelvic tumor associated with hypoglycemia, likely a case of non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH). Differential diagnoses could include other causes of pelvic masses, but imaging and surgical findings support the primary diagnosis. Prognosis depends on histopathological examination results. P: Management included continuous glucose infusion and glucocorticoid administration to manage hypoglycemia. Complete surgical resection of the tumor was achieved. Post-operative plan includes monitoring blood glucose levels, histopathological examination of the tumor, and regular follow-up care. Further treatment will be based on histopathology results. Patient education on signs of hypoglycemia and when to seek medical help is crucial. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you've been admitted to the hospital today. Can you tell me what happened? Patient: Yeah, I was bitten by a dog on 19th July while I was visiting my girlfriend in Tshelimnyama. Doctor: I see. The dog that bit you, it was referred to as Dog VG, right? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Hmm, do you know if the dog had been acting strangely before it bit you? Patient: Actually, the owners said it was usually well behaved, but it suddenly started showing strange behaviour recently. Doctor: Did the owners mention if the dog was vaccinated during the recent vaccine campaign in the area? Patient: No, they told me that the dog wasn't vaccinated. Doctor: I understand that the dog was chained by its owners after the incident, but it broke free and went missing. Other people in the neighborhood reported seeing the dog attacking other dogs, is that right? Patient: Yeah, that's what I heard. Apparently, Dog VG was killed during one of those attacks. Doctor: We found the carcass of Dog VG slightly submerged in water and in an advanced state of decomposition on 28 August 2012. We've sent the brain material to the University of Pretoria for further testing. Patient: Oh, okay. What kind of testing are they doing? Doctor: They will be conducting molecular testing on the brain material to help us better understand the situation. The sample was sent in a 50% glycerol-saline solution on 30 August 2012. Patient: I see. So, what should I do now? Doctor: For now, we will monitor your condition and wait for the test results. Once we have more information, we will determine the best course of action for your treatment. In the meantime, please let us know if you experience any symptoms or discomfort. Patient: Alright, I'll do that. Thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient reports being bitten by a dog, referred to as Dog VG, on 19th July while visiting his girlfriend in Tshelimnyama.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, I understand you've been experiencing bladder outlet obstruction and bladder stones. Can you tell me more about your medical history? Patient: Sure, I have a history of BPH, which caused recurrent urinary tract infections. I also had elevated prostate-specific antigen levels, but the biopsy came back negative. Additionally, I have hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. We performed a preoperative transrectal ultrasound, which estimated your prostate volume to be 150 cc. We decided to do a HoLEP surgery using a two-incision technique to help with your bladder issues. Patient: How did the surgery go? Doctor: During the surgery, we encountered a large amount of adenoma, so we spent an extended time on morcellation, about 120 minutes. However, there was poor observation due to bleeding at the bladder neck, and we noted an area of capsular perforation at the 5 o'clock position in the mid gland. Patient: Oh, I see. What happened next? Doctor: When we removed the operative drapes, we noticed significant abdominal distention. In a discussion with the anesthetist, your airway pressures upon induction were initially between 10 and 20, but during the procedure, they increased to over 30. Your systolic pressure also dropped to 80-90, whereas preoperatively you were above 110 systolic. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We were concerned about a potential bladder injury and consulted general surgery intraoperatively. They recommended a subumbilical minilaparotomy, as initial laparoscopy was unsuccessful due to increased opening pressures with the Veress needle. Patient: What happened during the minilaparotomy? Doctor: We suctioned less than 400 cc of bloody-colored fluid from your abdomen. An intraoperative cystogram was performed, which revealed retroperitoneal extravasation but no intraperitoneal bladder injury or perforation. Patient: So, what does that mean? Doctor: It means that the capsular perforation likely caused extraperitonealization of intraoperative saline. We placed a 10F Jackson Pratt drain in your pelvis and closed the fascia and skin. We also administered 20 mg of IV Lasix during the procedure. Patient: What are the next steps for me? Doctor: We will monitor your recovery closely and ensure that the drain is functioning properly. It is crucial that you follow up with us so that we can assess your progress and address any concerns you may have. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. I appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care and get well soon. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), recurrent urinary tract infections, elevated prostate-specific antigen levels (negative biopsy), hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, presented with bladder outlet obstruction and bladder stones. He reported undergoing HoLEP surgery for these issues. O: Preoperative transrectal ultrasound showed a prostate volume of 150 cc. During HoLEP surgery, significant adenoma was encountered, leading to prolonged morcellation (120 minutes) and capsular perforation at the 5 o'clock position of the mid gland. Postoperative findings included significant abdominal distention, increased airway pressures (initially 10-20, increased to over 30), and a drop in systolic pressure to 80-90. Intraoperative consultation with general surgery led to a subumbilical minilaparotomy after unsuccessful laparoscopy. Less than 400 cc of bloody-colored fluid was suctioned from the abdomen. An intraoperative cystogram revealed retroperitoneal extravasation but no intraperitoneal bladder injury. A 10F Jackson Pratt drain was placed, and 20 mg of IV Lasix was administered. A: The primary diagnosis is bladder outlet obstruction secondary to BPH with complications of intraoperative capsular perforation and retroperitoneal extravasation. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of increased intra-abdominal pressure and bleeding. The prognosis depends on effective management of the postoperative complications and monitoring for any further issues. P: The patient will be closely monitored postoperatively to ensure proper functioning of the abdominal drain and to manage blood pressure and fluid status. Follow-up appointments are crucial to assess recovery and address any emerging concerns. The patient has been advised to reach out with any questions or issues during the recovery process. Further consultations with urology and possibly general surgery may be required depending on the recovery progress. Compliance with postoperative instructions and medications is essential for recovery. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, what brings you in today? Patient: Well, I've had a history of hematemesis and melena. Yesterday, I had two episodes of bright red emesis and four episodes of dark colored stools, followed by a brief syncopal episode that lasted for 10-15 seconds. I'm also experiencing epigastric pain. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your medical history? Patient: Sure. I was diagnosed with polycystic liver disease and portal hypertension a year ago when I had similar symptoms. I had an EGD done, which showed esophageal varices, and I underwent banding. I don't have a history of alcohol use, NSAID ingestion, or peptic ulcer disease. I'm gravida 3, para 3, and had a tubal ligation after my last pregnancy. I've never used oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. My mother and maternal aunt had cystic liver disease and liver failure. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. When you presented today, your vitals showed that you were afebrile with a temperature of 98.7°F, tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats/min, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 18/min, and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 97/60 mmHg. Your abdominal examination showed a mildly distended abdomen with epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness, and normal bowel sounds. Your extremities displayed bilateral 1+ pitting edema. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: We also did some blood work which showed a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dl, hematocrit of 24%, white blood count of 10.8 cells/mm3, and platelet count of 162 cells/mm3. Your metabolic panel showed nonanion gap metabolic acidosis with a serum bicarbonate level of 17 mEq/L, normal serum BUN, and creatinine levels of 23 mg/dl and 0.57 mg/dl, respectively. Your liver panel showed a total bilirubin of 2.2 mg/dl, direct bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dl, and albumin of 2.5 g/dl. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: Based on your symptoms and test results, it's important that we continue to monitor and manage your polycystic liver disease and portal hypertension. We'll need to keep an eye on your esophageal varices and possibly perform additional banding if needed. It's also crucial to avoid any factors that may worsen your condition, such as alcohol, NSAIDs, or hormonal therapies. Patient: Yes, I understand. Doctor: We'll also need to keep a close watch on your blood pressure and other vital signs, as well as your hemoglobin, hematocrit, and liver panel. It's important to maintain regular follow-ups and notify us if you have any further episodes of hematemesis or melena, or any other concerning symptoms. Patient: Okay, I will do that.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, how are you feeling today? Patient: I've been feeling tired lately due to my sleep deprivation. Doctor: I see. I understand that you were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) 3 years ago. Have you received any treatment for it? Patient: No, I haven't. Doctor: Alright. I've noticed from your records that you are a 46-year-old man, weighting 176 kg with a BMI of 53.7 kg/m2. We have scheduled you for gastric volume reduction surgery to reduce your body weight under general anesthesia. We performed an airway inspection and found that you have a short neck with a circumference of 51 cm. Your neck is quite limited in extension due to its thick fat, with a Mallampatti score of Ш.  Patient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Yes, it can make the anesthesia process more challenging. I understand that you're nervous and have refused to consent for awake fiberoptic intubation under sedation. So, we've elected to perform tracheal intubation after anesthesia induction while keeping your spontaneous breathing to avoid hypoxia. We'll use initial direct laryngoscopy with a video laryngoscope and have a backup plan with fiberoptic intubation and then a laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Patient: Okay, I trust your judgment. Doctor: Great. We'll also use a bispectral index (BIS) to monitor the depth of your anesthesia. Your vital signs before anesthesia induction showed Bp 142/79 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, SpO2 96%, and RR 22 bpm. We'll give you Midazolam 3 mg and sufentanil 10 μg intravenously to reach a BIS of 62 for sedation.  Patient: Alright. Doctor: After that, we'll administer 100 mg of intravenous propofol, and your BIS should fall to 51. We'll be able to perform mask pressurized ventilation to maintain your SpO2 at 100%. You'll be under continuous target controlled infusion (TCI) at a propofol concentration of 3μg/mL. Patient: I see. Doctor: During the procedure, we may encounter some difficulties. For example, we tried direct laryngoscopy with a video laryngoscope twice, but it failed due to the invisible glottis obstructed by a huge epiglottis (Grace IIb view). Your SpO2 fell to 75% at the end of the second laryngoscopy. We had to initiate two-hand pressurized mask ventilation, which was difficult, but we were able to maintain your SpO2 around 88%. Patient: That sounds concerning. Doctor: Yes, but we're prepared for such situations. Your vital signs remained stable with BP 133/73 mmHg, HR 86 bpm, and normal sinus rhythm. Your BIS was 57. In case of further difficulty, we'll place a WEI Nasal Jet Tube (WNJ) from Well Lead Medical Equipment Ltd., Guangzhou. Patient: Okay. I appreciate your thoroughness. Doctor: Thank you for trusting us. We'll do our best to ensure your safety and comfort during the surgery. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll let you know if I have any questions. [/INST] S: The patient, a 46-year-old male, reports feeling tired due to sleep deprivation. He was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) three years ago but has not received any treatment for it. He expresses nervousness about the upcoming anesthesia but trusts the medical judgment. O: The patient weighs 176 kg with a BMI of 53.7 kg/m2. Airway inspection revealed a short neck with a circumference of 51 cm, limited neck extension, and a Mallampatti score of III. Vital signs before anesthesia induction were BP 142/79 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, SpO2 96%, and RR 22 bpm. During a trial of anesthesia, the patient's SpO2 dropped to 75% during failed direct laryngoscopy attempts, but was maintained around 88% with difficult two-hand pressurized mask ventilation. His BP was 133/73 mmHg, HR 86 bpm, with a normal sinus rhythm, and BIS was 57. A: The primary diagnosis is severe obstructive sleep apnea complicated by obesity. The patient's airway management is challenging due to anatomical considerations, which complicates the anesthesia process. The failed direct laryngoscopy indicates a difficult airway, categorized as a Grace IIb view due to a large epiglottis obstructing the glottis. P: The plan includes proceeding with gastric volume reduction surgery under general anesthesia with careful monitoring. Anesthesia induction will involve Midazolam 3 mg and sufentanil 10 μg IV, followed by 100 mg of IV propofol. Continuous target controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol at a concentration of 3μg/mL will be used to maintain anesthesia. Backup plans for airway management include the use of a video laryngoscope, fiberoptic intubation, laryngeal mask airway (LMA), and potentially a WEI Nasal Jet Tube (WNJ) if necessary. The patient's depth of anesthesia will be monitored using a bispectral index (BIS). Education on the importance of postoperative care and continuous monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation will be emphasized to ensure patient safety. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I have been experiencing pain, deformity, and limited mobility in my right knee. Doctor: I see. Did anything happen to cause this issue? Patient: Yeah, I suffered a fall about three years ago, but I didn't receive any treatment for it. Doctor: Alright, let's conduct a physical examination to better understand your situation. *After the examination* Based on the examination, there's a 10° varus deformity, a 25° flexion contracture, and a limited amount of joint movement in your right knee. However, there's no neurological damage, which is good. Patient: Oh, okay. Doctor: I'd like to take some Radiographs and a computed tomography (CT) scan to get a clearer picture of your knee. *After obtaining the results* The images show a malunited isolated medial condyle fracture in the coronal plane with an intra-articular incongruity. Patient: Hmm, what does that mean? Doctor: It means that the fracture didn't heal properly, and it's causing the deformity and pain in your knee. Additionally, we performed a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan, which revealed no ligament injuries, which is a positive sign. Patient: That's a relief. Doctor: In order to correct the issue, we need to perform a corrective osteotomy of the medial femoral condyle. Patient: How will that work? Doctor: First, we'll place your knee in a flexed position for the skin incision. We'll make an anterior skin incision that extends 3 cm proximal to the patella to the tibial tubercle. Then, we'll perform a medial parapatellar arthrotomy, which will be 2 cm proximal to the patella, curving along the medial patella and parallel to the patellar ligament to the tibial tubercle. By doing this, we'll expose the distal medial femoral condyle. Patient: Okay, then what? Doctor: We'll then detect an approximately 5-mm step in the medial femoral condyle. The chondral structures, meniscus, and ligaments appear to be in good shape. We'll identify the osteotomy line with fluoroscopy using two Kirschner wires. Patient: And after that? Doctor: The corrective osteotomy will be carried out carefully. We won't perform posterior soft tissue dissection to protect the blood supply of the femur medial condyle. However, this might cause some difficulty in bringing the osteotomized medial condyle to an anatomical position. Patient: How will you overcome that problem? Doctor: We'll hyperflex your knee and let the tibial plateau push the medial condyle forward. After that, we'll fix the condylar osteotomy fragment by inserting two 4.5-mm headless compression screws from the anterior to the posterior direction of the medial femoral condyle. Then, another screw will be inserted from the medial to the lateral direction. Patient: Will that help improve my knee? Doctor: Yes, after the procedure, we'll check the joint movements and should see that the varus deformities of your knee have improved. Patient: Thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything so clearly. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. [/INST] S: Patient reports experiencing pain, deformity, and limited mobility in the right knee, which began following a fall three years ago. No initial treatment was sought for the injury. O: Physical examination reveals a 10° varus deformity and a 25° flexion contracture in the right knee, with limited joint movement but no neurological damage. Radiographs and CT scans show a malunited isolated medial condyle fracture in the coronal plane with intra-articular incongruity. MRI scans indicate no ligament injuries. A: The primary diagnosis is a malunited fracture of the medial femoral condyle in the right knee, leading to varus deformity and flexion contracture. The absence of ligament damage is a positive finding, reducing the complexity of potential treatment. P: Plan to perform a corrective osteotomy of the medial femoral condyle. The procedure will involve a medial parapatellar arthrotomy and the use of fluoroscopy to guide osteotomy and fixation with headless compression screws. Post-operative care will include monitoring of joint movement and alignment. Further consultations with orthopedic surgery are scheduled, and patient education on post-surgical care and rehabilitation will be provided to ensure compliance and optimal recovery. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Patient: Hi, doctor. I'm an 18-year-old female with no significant past medical history. I went to urgent care because I had a sore throat, swollen neck, fevers, and chills for 5 days. They did a rapid strep test, but it came back negative. They sent me home on steroids and azithromycin. Doctor: I see. How have you been feeling since then? Patient: Well, I came to the emergency department two days later because my shortness of breath got worse and I had sudden onset pleuritic chest pain. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's review your symptoms. You mentioned shortness of breath and chest pain. What about your vitals? Patient: My temperature was 99 °F, blood pressure 107/66 mm Hg, pulse 138/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and SpO2 97%. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Your physical examination revealed tenderness in the neck, pus formation on the tonsils, and decreased breath sounds. The labs showed severe thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis with left shift, granulated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), and acute kidney injury (AKI). Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: No, it doesn't. Your initial chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions. A computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest without contrast revealed bilateral lung nodules and pleural effusions. An echocardiogram demonstrated a small pleural effusion with normal ejection fraction. Patient: What about the neck ultrasound and CT scan? Doctor: Those tests didn't show jugular vein thrombophlebitis or peritonsillar abscess, but the study was limited due to the insertion of bilateral internal jugular (IJ) catheter insertions. We obtained blood cultures, gave you intravenous fluids, and started empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous (IV) vancomycin, IV cefepime, and IV doxycycline. Patient: But things got worse, right? Doctor: Yes, unfortunately. You became more hypoxic, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. You went into septic shock and needed pressors. An interval chest X-ray demonstrated worsening bilateral effusions. Your renal function deteriorated, and you required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Patient: And then, I had a cardiac arrest? Doctor: Yes, you developed cardiac arrest due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) following chest compressions. Thankfully, there was a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Your blood culture grew Fusobacterium, and we changed your antibiotics accordingly. Patient: What's the plan now, doctor? Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and adjust your treatment as needed. It's important for you to rest and follow our instructions to help your recovery. [/INST] S: 18-year-old female with no significant past medical history presented with a 5-day history of sore throat, swollen neck, fevers, chills, worsening shortness of breath, and sudden onset pleuritic chest pain. Initial treatment with steroids and azithromycin was ineffective, leading to emergency department visit. Symptoms escalated to hypoxia, requiring intubation, and septic shock. O: Vital signs included temperature of 99 °F, blood pressure 107/66 mm Hg, pulse 138/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and SpO2 97%. Physical exam showed neck tenderness, pus on tonsils, and decreased breath sounds. Labs indicated severe thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis with left shift, granulated PMNs, and AKI. Imaging revealed bilateral pleural effusions, lung nodules, and small pleural effusion on echocardiogram. Blood culture grew Fusobacterium. Patient experienced cardiac arrest with successful ROSC. A: Primary diagnosis of septic shock secondary to Fusobacterium infection, complicated by AKI, severe thrombocytopenia, and acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Differential diagnoses initially included streptococcal pharyngitis and peritonsillar abscess, which were ruled out by imaging and labs. P: Continue IV antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and doxycycline, adjusted based on culture sensitivity. Maintain mechanical ventilation and CRRT for support. Monitor vital signs, lab values, and organ functions closely. Consider consultation with infectious disease for further management of Fusobacterium infection and cardiology for assessment post-cardiac arrest. Educate patient and family about the severity of the condition and the importance of compliance with the treatment plan. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, how have you been feeling lately? Have you been experiencing any symptoms related to your respiratory system? Patient: Well, I've been feeling a bit unwell, and I've had some trouble breathing recently. Doctor: I see. Based on your past medical history, I know you've had recurrent pneumonia. We performed a Chest X-ray and noticed infiltrative shadows in your right lower lung field, as shown in Fig. A. Patient: Oh really? That doesn't sound good. Doctor: To get a better understanding of your condition, we also conducted a Chest CT. It showed numerous cystic lesions and infiltrative shadows in your right lower lobe, as you can see in Fig. B. Patient: That's worrisome. What does it all mean? Doctor: Well, after treating your pneumonia, we performed an open right lower lobectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove part of your lung, about three months ago. The evaluation of the surgical specimen revealed numerous cysts in your lungs, with some reaching up to 4 cm in diameter. Patient: Oh wow, that's quite large. What else did you find? Doctor: The histological findings of the resected specimen showed multiple cysts composed of fibrous walls lined by ciliated columnar cells, without bronchial cartilage, as you can see in Fig. A and B. Based on these findings, we diagnosed your condition as CCAM type 1. Patient: I see. Were there any atypical cells found in the cysts? Doctor: No, atypical cells were not identified, which is a good sign. Patient: That's a relief. What should I do now to take care of my health? Doctor: It's important to continue monitoring your condition and follow up with your healthcare team regularly. Make sure to report any new symptoms or changes in your health, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to stay on top of my health and follow your advice. [/INST] S: The patient reports feeling unwell and experiencing difficulty breathing recently. They have a history of recurrent pneumonia and underwent an open right lower lobectomy three months ago. O: Recent Chest X-ray and Chest CT revealed infiltrative shadows in the right lower lung field and numerous cystic lesions in the right lower lobe. Histological examination of the resected lung specimen showed multiple cysts with fibrous walls lined by ciliated columnar cells, without bronchial cartilage. No atypical cells were identified. A: The patient's clinical presentation and diagnostic findings support a diagnosis of Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation (CCAM) type 1. The absence of atypical cells suggests no current malignancy. P: The plan includes regular monitoring and follow-up with the healthcare team to track any changes in the patient's condition. The patient is advised to report new symptoms and maintain a healthy lifestyle to manage their condition effectively. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you remind me when you first presented to the hospital with your symptoms? Patient: I first came in May 1998. Doctor: Yes, I see you had spontaneous bruising and mucosal bleeding at that time. Do you remember what your platelet count was? Patient: Hmm, I think it was really low, around 2 × 109/L. Doctor: That's correct. We found no other abnormalities in your blood counts or laboratory tests. You also have a history of alopecia totalis, but no other concomitant illness and no family history of blood disorders, right? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: So, we treated you with prednisone 100 mg daily, which improved your platelet count. However, when the dose was gradually reduced and stopped, the thrombocytopenia returned. In December 1998, you underwent a laparoscopic splenectomy, which resulted in a positive platelet count response, lasting 4 years. Do you recall when your thrombocytopenia relapsed? Patient: I think it was in April 2003. Doctor: Yes, and after another course of prednisone, your platelet count displayed a cyclical pattern, alternating between thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis. Your platelet count would fluctuate with a statistically significant period of 39 days, ranging from nadir values of less than 5 × 109/L to peak values of greater than 900 × 109/L. We also found statistically significant oscillations in your neutrophil counts with the same period, but the neutrophil nadir never dropped below the normal range.  Patient: Yeah, I remember that. Doctor: Cyclic thrombocytopenia persisted for over 10 years despite treatment with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, danazol, pulse dexamethasone, and rituximab. We measured your TPO levels for a period of 6 weeks and found that they were undetectable during periods of extreme thrombocytosis and increased when platelet counts were low. Patient: So, what's the next step in treatment? Doctor: We started treatment with the oral TPO receptor agonist eltrombopag, timed with anticipated periods of thrombocytopenia. Specifically, treatment was withheld during anticipated periods of escalating platelet counts and restarted when your platelet count was anticipated to drop below 100 × 109/L. You received 50 mg of eltrombopag daily from 30 November to 6 December 2010 and 2 January. Patient: Ok, got it. So, will I continue with this treatment? Doctor: Yes, we will continue to monitor your platelet count and adjust the eltrombopag treatment as needed. It's important to keep in close contact with us so we can ensure the best possible management of your condition. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care. [/INST] S: The patient first presented in May 1998 with spontaneous bruising and mucosal bleeding. The patient reported a history of alopecia totalis but no other concomitant illnesses or family history of blood disorders. The patient experienced recurrent thrombocytopenia after cessation of prednisone treatment, which initially improved the condition. The patient recalls a relapse of thrombocytopenia in April 2003, with a cyclical pattern of platelet count fluctuations and statistically significant oscillations in neutrophil counts. The patient has been treated with multiple therapies including corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, danazol, pulse dexamethasone, and rituximab without sustained improvement. O: Initial platelet count was extremely low at 2 × 10^9/L. Subsequent tests showed cyclical thrombocytopenia with platelet counts ranging from less than 5 × 10^9/L to more than 900 × 10^9/L over a period of 39 days. Neutrophil counts also oscillated but remained within the normal range. TPO levels were undetectable during periods of extreme thrombocytosis and increased when platelet counts were low. Recent treatment involved eltrombopag 50 mg daily during anticipated periods of thrombocytopenia. A: The primary diagnosis is cyclic thrombocytopenia. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of thrombocytopenia such as immune thrombocytopenia or bone marrow disorders, but these are less likely given the cyclical nature and specific laboratory findings. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic with current management strategies, though the condition has been persistent and challenging to manage over the past decade. P: Continue monitoring the patient's platelet count closely and adjust the dosage of eltrombopag as needed. Treatment with eltrombopag will be withheld during periods of escalating platelet counts and restarted when counts are anticipated to drop below 100 × 10^9/L. The patient is advised to maintain close contact with the healthcare team for ongoing assessment and management. Further education on recognizing signs of bleeding and when to seek immediate care will be provided. Regular follow-ups are scheduled to reassess the effectiveness of the current treatment plan and make necessary adjustments. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been having recurrent sinusitis, arthritis in my ankles and knees, and some painless nodular skin lesions at my extremities. I also have a history of eosinophilia. Doctor: I see. Tell me more about your medical history. Patient: Well, I was diagnosed with pancytopenia and MDS in 1996 when I was 30. I had spontaneous rectal bleeding and fatigue, and they thought it was haemorrhoidal disease. Doctor: Hmm, that's quite a while ago. Have you had any other issues since then? Patient: Yes, six years after my MDS diagnosis, I was admitted to the hospital with hepatosplenomegaly, erythema nodosum, retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement, and bilateral pleural effusion. They couldn't find any fungal, bacterial, or HIV infection, but I was diagnosed with chronic granulomatous pleuritis. Doctor: How were you treated for that? Patient: I was treated empirically for tuberculosis with isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide. But I developed an allergy to pyrazinamide, so they used ethambutol instead. Doctor: Okay, and how were your blood cell counts at that time? Patient: They were pretty low. My haemoglobin was 7.7 g/dL, WBC was 3000 cells/μL, lymphocytes were 750/μL, monocytes were 60/μL, and platelets were 95,000/μL. Doctor: Did your blood counts improve over time? Patient: A year later, my monocytopenia improved slightly, but my thrombocytopenia worsened. My WBC was 1900 cells/μL, lymphocytes were 475/μL, monocytes were 114/μL, and platelets were 33,000/μL. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other issues in recent years? Patient: In 2006, I had respiratory distress and my bronchial analysis was negative for bacterial infection. I was treated with clarithromycin for possible atypical pneumonia. Then in 2007, I lost 27% of my total body weight. I started having night fevers, night sweats, Raynaud phenomenon, left thigh superficial thrombophlebitis, and painless perimalleolar ulcers. Doctor: That's concerning. Did you undergo any biopsies for these symptoms? Patient: Yes, I had skin and bone marrow biopsies. The ulcer biopsy showed vasculitis with eosinophils, and the bone marrow biopsy showed myelodysplastic features and noncaseating granuloma. They also did a myeloculture, which was negative. Doctor: Thank you for sharing all of this information. In 2008, did you develop any other conditions? Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Doctor: Alright, based on your history and current symptoms, it's essential that we continue monitoring your blood counts and manage your various conditions. Please make sure to schedule regular follow-up appointments so we can adjust your treatment plan as needed. And don't hesitate to contact us if you notice any changes in your symptoms or if you have any concerns. [/INST] S: The patient reports recurrent sinusitis, arthritis in the ankles and knees, and painless nodular skin lesions on the extremities. The patient has a history of eosinophilia, pancytopenia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) diagnosed in 1996, chronic granulomatous pleuritis, hypothyroidism, and various episodes of severe systemic symptoms including night fevers, night sweats, and significant weight loss. The patient also mentioned a history of spontaneous rectal bleeding initially thought to be hemorrhoidal disease. O: Previous treatments include empirical tuberculosis treatment with modification due to allergy to pyrazinamide. Blood counts over the years have shown persistent abnormalities including low hemoglobin, WBC, lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets with fluctuating severity. Recent biopsies indicated vasculitis with eosinophils and noncaseating granuloma in the bone marrow. The patient's medical history is significant for multiple severe systemic and hematologic complications without clear infectious etiologies. A: The patient's complex medical history and current symptoms suggest a multifaceted condition with autoimmune and granulomatous features, likely linked to underlying MDS and chronic inflammation. Differential diagnoses could include autoimmune disorders, ongoing effects of MDS, or other hematologic abnormalities. The presence of vasculitis, granulomatous inflammation, and recurrent severe systemic symptoms necessitates close monitoring and comprehensive management. P: Continue regular monitoring of blood counts and systemic symptoms. Manage arthritis and sinusitis symptomatically and monitor for any new symptoms indicating worsening or new systemic involvement. Adjust immunosuppressive or supportive therapies as needed based on ongoing assessments. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to reassess the patient's condition and treatment efficacy. Educate the patient on signs of potential complications or exacerbations requiring urgent care. Ensure thyroid function is regularly evaluated given the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you were admitted to SKKRC with non-itching papulo-macular skin lesions all over your body for 7 months. Can you tell me more about that? Patient: Yeah, that's right. I had these weird skin lesions for months, but they didn't itch or anything. Doctor: I understand. It also says here that you have a history of VL 2.5 years back and were treated with a single dose of LAmB. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. I got cured after that treatment. Doctor: Good to know. So, upon examination, you were found to be non-febrile, not anemic, and no hepato-splenomegaly was detected. Your rK39 RDT was positive, and direct microscopy of your skin biopsy showed LD bodies. Your qPCR for LD-DNA was also positive. After confirming the diagnosis, you were treated as a PKDL case with Cap. Miltefosine, 50mg (Cap. Miltefos, Popular Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Batch No.– SLL 21), two capsules daily for 84 days. Can you confirm this? Patient: Yes, that's correct. I took those capsules for the treatment. Doctor: It seems that about 7 weeks later, you developed a painful, red eye with watery discharge and dimness of vision, along with marginal white discoloration of the left eye. Is that right? Patient: Yeah, it was really painful and my vision got blurry. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Despite the instructions, you didn’t stop taking the medicines for another two weeks and then contacted the physicians at SKKRC. They stopped your medication and referred you to the ophthalmology department at MMCH for further management. Can you tell me what happened there? Patient: When I went to the ophthalmology department, they examined my eye and found visual acuity 3/60, congested conjunctiva, and peripheral corneal infiltration which extends towards the center, and presence of hypopyon. Doctor: Okay, so you were diagnosed as a case of Marginal Keratitis, and they treated you with topical antibiotics in addition to steroid and lubricant eye drops. How did your eye respond to the treatment? Patient: My eye got better after using the antibiotics and eye drops. Doctor: That's good to hear. After recovery from your eye complications, you were administered LAmB at SKKRC. How have you been since then? Patient: I've been doing well since then. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. On your 6-month follow-up after treatment, your skin qPCR for LD-DNA was negative, and there were no further ophthalmic complaints. Is that right? Patient: Yes, everything has been fine since then. Doctor: Great. It's important to continue monitoring your health and following up with your doctors as needed. If you have any concerns or notice any changes in your symptoms, don't hesitate to contact your healthcare team. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to keep an eye on my health and reach out if I have any concerns. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and I hope you continue to stay healthy. [/INST] S: The patient reported having non-itching papulo-macular skin lesions for 7 months. He has a history of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) treated with a single dose of Liposomal Amphotericin B (LAmB) 2.5 years ago. Recently, he developed a painful, red eye with watery discharge, dimness of vision, and marginal white discoloration of the left eye approximately 7 weeks after starting treatment for Post-Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) with Miltefosine. O: Physical examination showed the patient to be non-febrile, not anemic, and without hepato-splenomegaly. Diagnostic tests included a positive rK39 rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and positive qPCR for Leishmania donovani (LD) DNA from skin biopsy. Ophthalmologic examination revealed visual acuity of 3/60, congested conjunctiva, peripheral corneal infiltration extending towards the center, and presence of hypopyon, leading to a diagnosis of Marginal Keratitis. Treatment included topical antibiotics, steroids, and lubricant eye drops, which improved the eye condition. Follow-up after 6 months showed negative skin qPCR for LD-DNA and no ophthalmic complaints. A: The primary diagnosis is PKDL, with a secondary complication of Marginal Keratitis likely related to the Miltefosine treatment. The patient's history of VL and recent treatment response supports these diagnoses. P: The patient completed the prescribed course of Miltefosine for PKDL and received appropriate ophthalmologic care for Marginal Keratitis. He was treated with LAmB at follow-up for PKDL. Ongoing monitoring and regular follow-ups are recommended to ensure no recurrence of PKDL or further ophthalmic issues. The patient is advised to remain vigilant about any new symptoms and to maintain regular contact with his healthcare providers. </s>"

I understand that you have a history of subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth II anastomosis for a benign gastric ulcer perforation 40 years prior. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: During the physical examination, your blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate was 105 beats/minute, respiratory rate was 20 respirations/minute, and you had a temperature of 39.0°C. We also noticed that you had marked tenderness in the epigastric area of your abdomen.  Patient: Yes, it's been quite painful. Doctor: We conducted some laboratory tests and found the following: white blood cell count was 10,870 /mm3, hemoglobin 9.0 g/dL, platelet count 247,000 /mm3, albumin 3.3 g/dL, total/direct bilirubin 2.06/1.38 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase 45 U/l, aspartate aminotransferase 133 U/l, alkaline phosphatase 172 U/I, and CA 19-9 165.95 U/Ml.  Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: We also performed an abdominal computed tomography which showed prominent dilatation of the duodenal loop, common bile duct, and bilateral intrahepatic ducts, as well as a large amount of ascites. Based on these findings, we have diagnosed you with afferent loop syndrome complicated by biliary tree dilatation and suspect that you may have ascending cholangitis. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Unfortunately, due to your poor general condition and the presence of ascites suggesting peritoneal seeding, surgical treatment is not an option for you. We have decided to perform a sonography-guided percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) procedure. Patient: What does that involve? Doctor: We will insert an 8.5 French, multiside hole pigtail catheter tip via the dilated left intrahepatic duct, with the catheter tip placed in the common bile duct, under fluoroscopy. Patient: I see. Doctor: To confirm the diagnosis and for further management, we will also perform an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. During the endoscopy, we will examine the previous subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth II anastomosis. Patient: Alright. What should I expect after these procedures?

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, I'm Dr. Smith. I understand you have a history of myelofibrosis for 20 years and are currently being treated with ruxolitinib. How have you been feeling lately? Patient: Hi, Doctor. Lately, I've been feeling progressively more short of breath and weak. Doctor: I see. I have your records here, and it looks like you initially presented to an outside hospital with these symptoms. They found that your anemia had worsened compared to your baseline. Chest imaging also demonstrated a large left pleural effusion, for which you underwent thoracentesis. You were then transferred to our institution for further management. Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: On presentation to our institution, your blood pressure was 131/85 mmHg, pulse 90 beats/min, and respiratory rate 18 breaths/min. Your temperature was 98.1F and your oxygen saturation was 98% while breathing supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula at 2 L/min. You seemed to be in mild respiratory distress. Can you describe how you were feeling then? Patient: I was having trouble breathing, and I felt really weak and tired. Doctor: Okay, thank you. During your examination, we noticed a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur in your cardiac exam. Your lung examination showed decreased breath sounds at the left base with dullness to percussion. Other findings included pallor, palpable splenomegaly, and lower extremity edema.  Patient: Yeah, I noticed the swelling in my legs too. Doctor: Your laboratory evaluation showed some abnormal values. You had leukocytosis, with a count of 18.4 k/mm3, which is above the normal range of 4.8-10.8 k/mm3, and an increase in myeloid precursors. Your hemoglobin was 5.6 g/dl, which is lower than the normal range of 12-16 g/dL. You also had thrombocytopenia with a count of 77 k/mm3, below the normal range of 160-410 k/mm3. Your lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was 882 U/L, higher than the normal range of 125-220 U/L. However, your coagulation parameters were unremarkable. Patient: That's a lot of numbers, but it sounds like things aren't looking too good. Doctor: Yes, it's important for us to monitor these values closely. Your chest X-ray showed complete opacification of the left hemithorax with rightward displacement of the trachea. We urgently placed a left chest tube which yielded grossly bloody pleural fluid consisting of a red blood cell (RBC) count of 1,415,000/mm3 and an LDH of 1555 U/L. We will continue to manage your condition and make adjustments to your treatment as needed. Patient: I appreciate your help, Doctor. What should I expect going forward? Doctor: We will closely monitor your symptoms and laboratory values. It's crucial to keep an open line of communication with us about any changes in your symptoms. We'll do our best to manage your myelofibrosis and complications, such as pancytopenia and massive splenomegaly, while keeping you as comfortable as possible. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to keep you updated on how I'm feeling. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Take care, and I'll see you at your next appointment. Patient: Thanks again, Doctor. See you then. [/INST] S: The patient, with a 20-year history of myelofibrosis currently treated with ruxolitinib, reports progressive shortness of breath, weakness, and tiredness. Previously noted worsening anemia and a large left pleural effusion at an outside hospital. O: Vital signs at our institution showed BP 131/85 mmHg, pulse 90 bpm, RR 18 breaths/min, temperature 98.1F, and oxygen saturation 98% on 2 L/min nasal cannula. Physical exam revealed mild respiratory distress, a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, decreased breath sounds at the left base, dullness to percussion, pallor, palpable splenomegaly, and lower extremity edema. Lab findings included leukocytosis (WBC 18.4 k/mm3), severe anemia (Hgb 5.6 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelets 77 k/mm3), and elevated LDH (882 U/L). Chest X-ray showed complete opacification of the left hemithorax with tracheal deviation. A chest tube was placed, yielding bloody pleural fluid with high RBC and LDH levels. A: The primary diagnosis is exacerbated myelofibrosis with complications including severe anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and a significant left pleural effusion likely contributing to respiratory symptoms. Differential diagnoses could include secondary infections or other malignancies complicating the primary disease. P: Continue monitoring vital signs, blood counts, and LDH levels closely. Adjust ruxolitinib dosage as needed based on clinical response and side effects. Manage pleural effusion with chest tube drainage and consider further diagnostic tests to determine the cause of the effusion. Supportive care for anemia may include transfusions, and diuretics for edema. Regular follow-ups to monitor the progression of myelofibrosis and manage complications. Encourage the patient to report any new symptoms or changes in condition promptly. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented with a two-month history of difficulty urinating. Can you tell me more about the symptoms you've been experiencing? Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble peeing for a while now, and I noticed a mass on my penis that's been growing. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Based on your description, it sounds like the penile mass might be the cause of your difficulty urinating. We found that the mass was hard, fixed, and involved about 50% of your penis. Additionally, you had bilateral palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy. There were no associated constitutional symptoms, but given our high suspicion for malignancy, you underwent a partial penectomy within a month of presentation. Patient: So, what were the results of the biopsy? Doctor: The biopsy results confirmed a pT2 tumor with invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated. The tumor size was 5 × 4 × 2.5 cm, with corpus spongiosum and lymphovascular involvements. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What happened next? Doctor: After the procedure, we performed a PET-CT for staging, and the imaging revealed enlarged hypermetabolic bilateral axillary lymph nodes, which raised concerns for metastatic disease. Additionally, there was a large centrally necrotic lymph node conglomerate in your left groin that had increased FDG avidity. Patient: So what did you do to treat it? Doctor: We proceeded with left inguinal and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections, which showed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in multiple lymph nodes. The left inguinal mass was also found to be metastatic well-differentiated SCC. Your diagnosis was staged at T2N3M0. Patient: What was my treatment plan after the surgery? Doctor: After your surgical procedures, we started you on adjuvant chemotherapy. Your first-line chemotherapy included paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (TIP). You underwent four cycles of TIP, but unfortunately, disease progression was observed on repeat imaging. Patient: What did you do after that? Doctor: We then started you on cetuximab, given EGFR amplification on tumor analysis with the FoundationOne testing platform. However, you experienced an allergic reaction to cetuximab, so we changed your treatment to panitumumab. Patient: Did that treatment work? Doctor: Yes, you had stable disease and a progression-free survival of 6 months with anti-EGFR treatment, which is clinically significant given that this treatment was given in the second-line setting for an aggressive tumor type that other than chemotherapy there is no other approved drug to date. Patient: What's the next step in my treatment? Doctor: You were ultimately started on the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab, which is an immunotherapy drug that can help your immune system fight cancer cells. Patient: Okay, I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, a male, reports a two-month history of difficulty urinating and the presence of a growing penile mass. He has not experienced any constitutional symptoms. O: Physical examination revealed a hard, fixed penile mass involving approximately 50% of the penis and bilateral palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy. A partial penectomy was performed, and biopsy confirmed a pT2 poorly differentiated, invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (5 × 4 × 2.5 cm) with corpus spongiosum and lymphovascular involvement. PET-CT imaging showed enlarged hypermetabolic bilateral axillary lymph nodes and a large necrotic lymph node conglomerate in the left groin with increased FDG avidity. Subsequent dissections confirmed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in multiple lymph nodes. The patient's cancer was staged as T2N3M0. A: The primary diagnosis is poorly differentiated, invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the penis with lymphovascular and nodal involvement, staged as T2N3M0. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of penile cancer or metastatic disease from another primary site. The prognosis is guarded due to the aggressive nature of the tumor and evidence of metastatic spread. P: The patient underwent a partial penectomy followed by left inguinal and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections. Post-surgical management included adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (TIP), which was followed by targeted therapy with cetuximab and then panitumumab due to an allergic reaction. After observing disease progression, the patient was started on nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor. Continued monitoring through imaging and tumor markers, along with supportive care, will be necessary. Referral to an oncology specialist for ongoing management and possible enrollment in clinical trials for advanced therapies is recommended. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm here to report the case of a retired Caucasic 84-year-old woman who required a VIV procedure due to the degeneration of a previously implanted aortic bioprosthesis. Can you please tell me about your medical history? Patient: Sure, my cardiologic history started in 2006 when I experienced syncope and was then diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and severe mitral regurgitation. I had no previous clinical events before that. Doctor: I see. It looks like you underwent aortic valve replacement with a Mitroflow number 21 bioprosthesis and a Carpentier-Edwards Physio mitral annuloplasty ring implantation. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. After the surgery, I suffered from brady-tachy syndrome and needed a pacemaker implantation. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. In 2011, the initial signs of prosthesis degeneration were found during a routine transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), showing a transvalvular mean gradient of 26 mmHg. You were asymptomatic at that time, and you were also diagnosed with an indolent myeloma. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. The doctors decided on a conservative approach since I didn't have any symptoms. Doctor: I see. In January 2014, you started complaining of epigastric discomfort and dyspnea for minimal exertion. At that time, a TTE showed a further increase of the mean transvalvular gradient (35 mmHg) and occurrence of moderate paraprosthetic regurgitation due to detachment of the anterior edge of the aortic prosthesis ring. Is that accurate? Patient: Yes, that's when I started feeling discomfort and shortness of breath. Doctor: In February 2014, you were admitted to our department for an episode of pulmonary edema with angina. Can you describe the symptoms you experienced during that time? Patient: I remember having trouble breathing, chest pain, and my legs were swollen. Doctor: Thank you. The physical examination revealed bilateral crackles, 3/6 systolic ejection murmur, and leg swelling. Your neurological evaluation was normal. Your electrocardiogram showed transient diffuse ST segment depression, and your troponin values were slightly elevated at 0.08 ng/ml. Additionally, laboratory tests showed mild anemia with hemoglobin values at 11 g/dl and stage 3 chronic kidney disease with serum creatinine at 1.1 mg/dl and glomerular filtration rate at 47 mg/dl. Your hepatic function was normal. Does this information sound accurate to you? Patient: Yes, that's what the doctors told me when I was admitted. Doctor: Thank you for confirming that. Based on this information, we will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan accordingly. It's essential to attend regular follow-up appointments to ensure your health is properly managed. If you experience any new symptoms or worsening of your current symptoms, please inform your healthcare team immediately. Patient: Okay, I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me. [/INST] S: The patient is an 84-year-old Caucasian female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and severe mitral regurgitation diagnosed in 2006 following an episode of syncope. She underwent aortic valve replacement and mitral annuloplasty. Post-operatively, she developed brady-tachy syndrome requiring pacemaker implantation. In 2011, she was asymptomatic but echocardiography showed initial signs of prosthesis degeneration. She was also diagnosed with indolent myeloma. In 2014, she reported epigastric discomfort and dyspnea on minimal exertion. She was admitted for pulmonary edema and angina in February 2014, experiencing breathing difficulties, chest pain, and leg swelling. O: Physical examination revealed bilateral crackles, a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur, and leg swelling. Neurological evaluation was normal. ECG showed transient diffuse ST segment depression. Troponin was slightly elevated at 0.08 ng/ml. Hemoglobin was 11 g/dl, indicating mild anemia. Serum creatinine was 1.1 mg/dl and GFR was 47 ml/min, indicating stage 3 chronic kidney disease. Hepatic function was normal. Transthoracic echocardiography in 2014 showed a mean transvalvular gradient of 35 mmHg and moderate paraprosthetic regurgitation. A: The primary diagnosis is degeneration of aortic bioprosthesis with associated complications including pulmonary edema and angina. Differential diagnoses include exacerbation of chronic heart failure and progression of chronic kidney disease. The patient's history of indolent myeloma may also influence her overall health status and treatment options. P: Continue regular monitoring and follow-up appointments to assess the function of the prosthetic valve and manage associated conditions. Adjust medications as necessary to manage symptoms and underlying conditions. Educate the patient on recognizing and reporting new or worsening symptoms. Consider referral to a cardiologist for evaluation of potential valve replacement or repair. Ensure coordination with nephrology and oncology for management of chronic kidney disease and indolent myeloma, respectively. Encourage compliance with prescribed treatments and lifestyle modifications to support overall health. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your medical history? Patient: Well, I have a history of anti-centromere antibody positive systemic sclerosis with limited skin involvement, also known as CREST syndrome. Doctor: I see. So, what brought you to the emergency room recently? Patient: I had hematemesis and mild abdominal pain for a day, so I decided to come here. Doctor: Alright. When you first presented at the ER, your vital signs were within normal limits, and the physical examination revealed mild periumbilical tenderness and decreased bowel sounds. There were no significant signs of peritonitis. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: We also conducted some laboratory studies. Your WBC count was at 29X10^3/μl and your hemoglobin was 4.7 g/L, which was a decline compared to your baseline hemoglobin of 9.5 g/L. Your renal and liver function tests were within normal limits, but an elevated venous lactate level was noted. Do you understand these findings? Patient: Yes, I think so. Doctor: We treated you with intravenous fluid resuscitation and empirical piperacillin/tazobactam. Additionally, you received 2 units of red blood cells transfusion. A computed tomography (CT) scan of your abdomen showed a significantly dilated colon and pneumatosis intestinalis. Patient: Okay. Doctor: General surgery consultation deemed no surgical intervention necessary, considering that the pneumatosis intestinalis was stable compared to the previous CT findings two years ago and the absence of acute peritonitis signs. You were then admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of acute on chronic anemia from GI bleeding. Patient: Right. Doctor: An urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed and only identified Barrett's-type esophageal mucosa and erosive gastritis without actively bleeding lesions. You were discharged home on the 4th day of hospitalization after tolerating liquid food. Is that accurate? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: But then you came back to the ER with severe lower abdominal pain just a few hours after discharge. Can you describe the pain? Patient: It was a sharp, constant, and nonradiating pain in my lower abdomen. Doctor: Did you experience melena or hematochezia? Patient: No, I didn't. Doctor: On examination, we noted absent bowel sounds and abdominal distention without rebound tenderness or guarding. Your laboratory evaluation was significant for leukocytosis and hypokalemia. A repeated CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis showed distended intestines. We'll continue to monitor and treat these issues accordingly. Do you have any questions or concerns? Patient: No, thank you for explaining everything to me. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of anti-centromere antibody positive systemic sclerosis (CREST syndrome), presented with hematemesis and mild abdominal pain. The patient described the pain as sharp, constant, and nonradiating in the lower abdomen, without accompanying melena or hematochezia. O: Initial vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination showed mild periumbilical tenderness and decreased bowel sounds, but no signs of peritonitis. Laboratory findings included a WBC count of 29X10^3/μl, hemoglobin of 4.7 g/L (baseline 9.5 g/L), normal renal and liver function, and elevated venous lactate. CT abdomen revealed a significantly dilated colon and pneumatosis intestinalis. Subsequent examinations showed absent bowel sounds and abdominal distention, with leukocytosis and hypokalemia noted. A repeated CT scan indicated distended intestines. A: The primary diagnosis is acute on chronic anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding, likely exacerbated by underlying systemic sclerosis. Differential diagnoses include ischemic bowel disease and complications from CREST syndrome. The absence of actively bleeding lesions during EGD and stable pneumatosis intestinalis suggests a non-surgical approach. P: The patient was managed with IV fluid resuscitation, empirical piperacillin/tazobactam, and transfusion of 2 units of red blood cells. Close monitoring in the ICU was required, and an urgent EGD was performed, identifying Barrett's esophagus and erosive gastritis. Discharge occurred on the fourth day post-admission after stabilization, but the patient returned with severe lower abdominal pain. Ongoing management includes monitoring of bowel function and electrolytes, with potential adjustments in therapy based on evolving clinical findings. Further consultations with gastroenterology and potentially rheumatology are advised to manage underlying systemic sclerosis and gastrointestinal symptoms. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Good morning! How can I help you today? Patient: Hi, doc. I've been diagnosed with stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma. I was treated with 6 cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed, followed by a maintenance regimen. But my cancer progressed after fourteen months, so I started second-line nivolumab treatment. Doctor: I see. How has your experience been with the nivolumab treatment? Patient: After thirteen doses of nivolumab, I started having irritated red eyes without any visual impairment. I don't have any skin issues, arthralgia, or urinary tract or digestive symptoms, though. Doctor: Have you tried any treatments for the red eyes? Patient: Yeah, I did a conjunctiva swab test, but it came back negative. I tried antibiotic ocular drops, but there was no improvement. Doctor: It seems the ophthalmologist's examination revealed bilateral sterile conjunctivitis without any signs of uveitis or retinal lesions, as shown in Fig. a. They treated you with topical steroids, and you experienced partial improvement, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Have you noticed any other symptoms recently? Patient: A few days ago, I started feeling really tired and developed progressive dysphagia. It got really severe after two months, and I lost 10 kg in weight. But I don't have any colitis or gastritis symptoms. Doctor: We need to consider a few possibilities for the cause of your dysphagia, such as esophageal infection, tumor progression with GI upper tract involvement, paraneoplastic syndrome, or an atypical checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse event. You mentioned you have no history of autoimmune disease, conjunctivitis, or upper digestive tract abnormality before the nivolumab treatment, right? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Your oral examination initially showed evidence for oral candidiasis, but a 7-day course of fluconazole didn't improve your dysphagia despite resolving the stomatitis. Additionally, the bacterial culture of your oropharyngeal swab was negative, as were PCR results for herpes simplex 1 and 2 infections. Your blood sample showed a slight increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) but no eosinophilia or leukocytosis. Your liver and kidney function panel tests were normal, and a thoracoabdominal CT scan reported no evidence of disease recurrence. Patient: So, what's the next step, doc? Doctor: Due to your fatigue, we'll implement a therapeutic break for one month and introduce prednisone at 30 mg per day, with rapid tapering over a month. We'll closely monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. [/INST] S: The patient, diagnosed with stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma, reports progression after initial chemotherapy and is currently on second-line nivolumab treatment. He presents with bilateral sterile conjunctivitis, severe progressive dysphagia, significant weight loss of 10 kg, and fatigue. No improvement in dysphagia was noted after treating oral candidiasis with fluconazole. The patient denies any history of autoimmune diseases or upper digestive tract abnormalities prior to nivolumab treatment. O: The patient has undergone 13 doses of nivolumab. Ophthalmological examination confirmed bilateral sterile conjunctivitis, treated with topical steroids with partial improvement. Oral examination initially showed oral candidiasis, treated successfully with fluconazole. Oropharyngeal swab and PCR for herpes simplex were negative. Blood tests showed slightly elevated ESR but normal eosinophil, leukocyte counts, and liver and kidney function. Thoracoabdominal CT scan showed no evidence of disease recurrence. A: Primary diagnosis is stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma with suspected nivolumab-induced adverse effects including bilateral sterile conjunctivitis and severe dysphagia, possibly due to an atypical checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse event or paraneoplastic syndrome. Differential diagnoses include esophageal infection or tumor progression with GI upper tract involvement. P: Implement a therapeutic break from nivolumab for one month. Initiate prednisone at 30 mg per day with a rapid tapering plan over the month. Monitor the patient's response to the steroid treatment and adjust the management plan as necessary. Further diagnostic workup may be required to explore the cause of dysphagia if no improvement is observed. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been having pain and paresthesia in my right arm since May 3rd while I was gardening. I went to an urgent care facility on May 6th about the arm pain. Doctor: I see. What did they tell you at the urgent care facility? Patient: They diagnosed me with carpal tunnel syndrome and prescribed me a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and hydrocodone. Doctor: Alright. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently? Patient: Yes, on May 7th, I started having shortness of breath, anxiety, insomnia, and difficulty swallowing water. I was worried I was exposed to a toxic substance. Doctor: I understand your concern. Did you see a doctor for these symptoms? Patient: Yes, I was evaluated at hospital A. They ran some diagnostic tests like complete blood count, serum chemistry, D-dimer, troponin, magnesium, electrocardiogram, and chest radiographs. The results were unremarkable. Doctor: Okay. And what happened after that? Patient: They gave me 0.75 mg of lorazepam for a presumed panic attack and discharged me. But as soon as I entered my car, I felt claustrophobic and had shortness of breath, so I went back to the emergency department. Doctor: And what did they do when you returned? Patient: They gave me an additional 0.25 mg of lorazepam and discharged me again. But on May 8th, I had to be transported by ambulance to the emergency department of hospital B due to chest discomfort, shortness of breath, progressive paresthesia in my right shoulder and arm, and increased anxiety. Doctor: That sounds concerning. How were you during the examination at hospital B? Patient: I was agitated, tachycardic, and tachypneic. They also found dysmetria during my neurologic exam, which they said was a type of ataxia. Doctor: What did the laboratory results show at hospital B? Patient: They found elevated cardiac enzymes, a serum troponin I level of 1.05 ng/mL, and a serum lactate level of 8.8 mmol/L. Doctor: It seems that the electrocardiogram results suggested acute cardiac ischemia with atypical chest pain. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's what they told me. Doctor: I see that you underwent emergency cardiac catheterization. What were the findings? Patient: They said it indicated normal. Doctor: Alright. It's important to continue monitoring your symptoms and follow up with your primary care physician to manage your condition. Make sure to inform them of the medications you've taken and the tests you've had done. Patient: Okay, thank you so much for your help, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care of yourself and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. [/INST] S: Patient reports experiencing pain and paresthesia in the right arm since May 3rd, initially occurring during gardening. Symptoms escalated to include shortness of breath, anxiety, insomnia, and difficulty swallowing by May 7th. Patient was concerned about exposure to a toxic substance. Previous interventions include a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome at an urgent care facility, treatment with NSAIDs and hydrocodone, and administration of lorazepam for presumed panic attacks at hospital A. Symptoms persisted, leading to multiple emergency department visits. O: Initial vital signs at hospital B showed agitation, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Neurologic examination revealed dysmetria. Laboratory tests indicated elevated cardiac enzymes and serum lactate levels (8.8 mmol/L, normal range 0.5-2.2 mmol/L), with a serum troponin I level of 1.05 ng/mL (normal range <0.04 ng/mL). ECG suggested acute cardiac ischemia. Emergency cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries. A: Primary diagnosis of acute cardiac ischemia with atypical presentation, possibly complicated by anxiety and panic disorder. Differential diagnoses include toxic exposure and carpal tunnel syndrome. The presence of dysmetria and elevated lactate levels may suggest additional neurological or systemic involvement. P: Continue monitoring cardiac and neurological symptoms closely. Follow up with primary care physician and cardiology to manage potential ischemic heart disease and to evaluate for other systemic or neurological conditions. Ensure adherence to prescribed medications, including lorazepam for anxiety, and NSAIDs and hydrocodone for carpal tunnel syndrome. Consider psychiatric evaluation for management of anxiety and panic symptoms. Educate patient on recognizing symptoms of cardiac ischemia and when to seek immediate care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I understand that you underwent a catheter insertion back in 1998 for your membranous glomerulopathy and stage 5 chronic kidney disease. Can you tell me how you've been feeling since then? Patient: Yeah, I've had some ups and downs, but overall, it's been manageable. Doctor: I can see that your estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, was 13 mL/min/1.73m2 at that time. Over the years, you continued to have proteinuria and were managed with perindopril. Your renal function remained relatively stable until late 2017 when it began to decline. In February 2018, after your eGFR dropped to 7 mL/min/1.73m2, you consented to initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD). A radiograph of your abdomen showed the PD catheter was optimally positioned in the true pelvis. Did you experience any issues with the catheter? Patient: No, not really. Doctor: Great. So, the exteriorization procedure was performed in the Home Dialysis Unit. A 0.5 cm skin incision was made 2 cm distal to the superficial cuff, and a loop of the catheter was mobilized. The fibrin was cleared off the catheter, but the distal catheter did not glide out easily. With the assistance of a surgeon, a second incision was made over the distal end of the catheter, and it was separated from the subcutaneous tissue by dissection. Did you experience any pain during this procedure? Patient: It was a bit uncomfortable, but not too painful. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. A large fibrin plug was removed from the lumen of the catheter with push and pull syringe aspiration. The flow remained very sluggish, so tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was instilled into the catheter. By the following day, the inflow significantly improved, but the outflow was still slow. Did you notice any changes in how the catheter was functioning? Patient: Yes, it seemed to be working better, but it was still a bit slow. Doctor: Two days later, a cathetergram and guide wire manipulation of the catheter was arranged through interventional radiology. The initial contrast injection showed the PD catheter localized within a pocket of fibrous tissue communicating with the greater peritoneal cavity along the right pelvic wall. Two angled glide-wires were utilized to clear fibrin out of the lumen of the catheter, and a torque cable was used to flip the draining loop out of the fibrous pocket into the greater peritoneal cavity. Following this, the outflow improved. Were you able to notice a difference after this procedure? Patient: Yes, it started working much better after that. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. It's important to continue monitoring your catheter function and renal health. Make sure to keep up with your scheduled appointments and report any changes in your symptoms or catheter function. Do you have any questions or concerns? Patient: No, I think you've covered everything. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. [/INST] S: The patient, who has a history of membranous glomerulopathy and stage 5 chronic kidney disease, underwent catheter insertion in 1998. He reports that his condition has been ""manageable"" with some ""ups and downs."" He consented to peritoneal dialysis (PD) initiation in February 2018 after his eGFR dropped to 7 mL/min/1.73m2. He describes the catheter exteriorization procedure as ""a bit uncomfortable, but not too painful"" and noted an improvement in catheter function after interventions, although it was ""still a bit slow."" O: Initial eGFR at the time of catheter insertion was 13 mL/min/1.73m2, declining to 7 mL/min/1.73m2 by February 2018. A radiograph confirmed optimal positioning of the PD catheter in the true pelvis. During the exteriorization procedure, a large fibrin plug was removed, and tPA was instilled to improve flow. Subsequent cathetergram and guide wire manipulation showed the catheter localized within a fibrous pocket along the right pelvic wall, which was corrected to improve outflow. A: The primary diagnosis is stage 5 chronic kidney disease secondary to membranous glomerulopathy, managed with peritoneal dialysis. The patient has experienced complications related to PD catheter function, including fibrin blockage and suboptimal positioning, which have been addressed with surgical and radiological interventions. The prognosis depends on ongoing management of renal function and catheter care. P: Continue regular monitoring of renal function and catheter performance. Maintain peritoneal dialysis regimen and monitor for any signs of infection or catheter malfunction. Scheduled follow-up appointments in the nephrology clinic are essential for ongoing assessment and management. Educate the patient on signs of catheter complications and encourage immediate reporting of any new symptoms. No additional referrals are indicated at this time. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I'm having this atraumatic right shoulder pain with activity and limited range of motion for a long time. Doctor: I see. Let's do a physical exam to understand the issue better. Please move your right shoulder for me. Patient: (moves right shoulder) Hmm, it's really painful and I can't move it much. Doctor: I can see that you have a significantly limited active range of motion in your right shoulder. We will need to take some Radiographs to get a better understanding of the problem. Patient: Okay, doctor. (After the Radiographs) Doctor: Your Radiographs show that there is superior escape of the humeral head with impingement of the greater tuberosity on the acromion and early acetabularization of the acromion (Fig.). We will need an MRI to confirm these findings. Patient: Alright, let's do the MRI. (After the MRI) Doctor: The MRI findings are consistent with your x-ray and show a lack of contiguous supraspinatus or infraspinatus tendon. At this juncture, I'm diagnosing you with rotator cuff arthropathy. I recommend a reverse total shoulder arthroplasty to treat your condition. Patient: I understand. Let's proceed with the surgery. (During the surgery) Doctor: We have placed you in the beach chair position, made an incision, and dissected the subcutaneous tissue. We identified and mobilized the cephalic vein, and found a nerve diving into the anterior deltoid muscle. We traced it and freed it from the deltoid muscle belly, allowing enough excursion to access the glenohumeral joint via a small deltoid window. Patient: (post-surgery) How did the operation go? Doctor: The operation went well and the wound was closed primarily. You were neurovascularly intact post-operatively, with intact sensation in the axillary nerve distribution and able to fire your deltoid muscle. Patient: That's great to hear! What's the recovery process like? Doctor: You healed without complications. At 4-6 weeks, you will start physical therapy to regain your range of motion and function. It's important to follow your therapist's instructions and attend all follow-up appointments. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to follow the instructions and attend all appointments.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your past medical history? Patient: Well, I was diagnosed with a pancreatic pseudocyst secondary to idiopathic acute pancreatitis two years ago. Doctor: I see. And what brings you here today? Patient: I've been experiencing severe acute gastrointestinal bleed and melena for a week now. Doctor: That sounds concerning. We'll need to get you admitted to the intensive care unit for supportive care including pantoprazole infusion, blood transfusion, and close monitoring. Your hemoglobin is quite low at 5.8 g/dL. Patient: Oh, that's not good. Doctor: We performed a CT scan of your abdomen which revealed a complex pancreatic mass representing a bleeding pancreatic pseudocyst. It also showed an interval increase in size when compared with your previous CT scans. Patient: Hmm, what does that mean? Doctor: We had you undergo an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). They showed submucosal bulging likely from extrinsic compression on the proximal gastric body and fundus, with a small clean-based ulcer on top of this bulge. The esophagus and duodenum appeared normal. Patient: Okay, and what did the EUS reveal? Doctor: The EUS confirmed the presence of an anechoic lesion with hyperechoic shadowing suggestive of a cyst or pseudocyst with bleeding located in the tail of the pancreas. The lesion measured approximately 50 x 50 mm in the maximal cross-sectional diameter. Patient: I see. Doctor: You continued to have melena and your hemoglobin decreased to 6.3 g/dL, so we provided an additional two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Patient: Alright. Doctor: We asked interventional radiology to perform a mesenteric angiogram to hopefully identify and control the source of bleeding. However, the angiogram did not demonstrate any active bleeding vessel. Patient: So, what's next? Doctor: Ultimately, the bleeding stopped spontaneously. We performed another EGD/EUS which noted two openings over the greater curvature of the stomach, suggestive of fistulous communication of the lesion with the stomach lumen. We inserted a bullet-tipped catheter into the lumen and aspiration showed blood consistent with a hemorrhagic pancreatic pseudocyst fistulizing into the stomach, causing severe upper gastrointestinal bleed. Patient: I understand. What are the follow-up requirements? Doctor: We will closely monitor your condition and provide any necessary supportive care. It's important to keep an eye on your symptoms and report any changes or concerns to your healthcare team. We'll also schedule regular check-ups to track your progress and ensure appropriate treatment. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance. [/INST] S: The patient reports a history of a pancreatic pseudocyst secondary to idiopathic acute pancreatitis diagnosed two years ago. Currently, the patient presents with severe acute gastrointestinal bleed and melena persisting for a week. O: The patient's hemoglobin was critically low at 5.8 g/dL upon admission. A CT scan indicated a complex pancreatic mass suggestive of a bleeding pancreatic pseudocyst with an increased size compared to previous scans. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed submucosal bulging on the proximal gastric body and fundus, with a small clean-based ulcer, and a 50 x 50 mm anechoic lesion with hyperechoic shadowing in the tail of the pancreas. Despite mesenteric angiogram showing no active bleeding vessel, subsequent EGD/EUS confirmed two openings over the greater curvature of the stomach, indicating a fistulous communication with the stomach lumen. Hemoglobin levels improved to 6.3 g/dL after transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). A: The primary diagnosis is a hemorrhagic pancreatic pseudocyst with fistulization into the stomach, causing severe upper gastrointestinal bleed. Differential diagnosis initially included other sources of gastrointestinal bleeding, but imaging and endoscopic findings confirmed the source as the pancreatic pseudocyst. P: The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for supportive care including pantoprazole infusion, blood transfusion, and close monitoring. Interventional radiology attempted to identify and control the bleeding source, which ultimately ceased spontaneously. A bullet-tipped catheter was inserted for aspiration, confirming the diagnosis. The patient will continue to be closely monitored with regular check-ups to manage and track the progression of the pseudocyst and associated complications. Further management will depend on the patient's ongoing response and any changes in symptoms. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see in your history that you have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pre-diabetes, chronic smoking, and alcoholism. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been experiencing amaurosis fugax lately. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. You also mentioned that you have suffered a previous left occipital lobe infarct, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: We performed a carotid duplex and computerized tomography angiography (CTA) of your head and neck, which confirmed a high-grade left internal carotid artery stenosis (ICA). We used a five French (Fr) sheath for femoral access and performed aortic arch angiography. Did you watch the video of your diagnostic angiography? Patient: Yes, I did. It showed the high-grade lesion in my left ICA. Doctor: Correct. We then proceeded with selective cannulation of your left common carotid artery (CCA) using an AR-1 catheter. An Accunet embolic protection device (EPD) was deployed, and we did pre-dilatation of the lesion with a 4-mm balloon Maverick. We also used a seven Fr Cook Shuttle sheath, which was advanced into your left CCA over a glide wire advantage. Patient: I remember that part. And then you placed the stent, right? Doctor: Yes, we deployed an Acculink 7 x 10 x 40-mm stent without difficulty. Post-dilatation was performed with a 5-mm balloon. Patient: But there was an issue with the EPD retrieval system, wasn't there? Doctor: That's correct. We had trouble advancing the EPD retrieval system beyond the origin of your left ICA. Even a smaller balloon couldn't cross the under-expanded proximal stent strut. We tried maneuvers like having you turn your head to the right, but that didn't help. Patient: So, what did you do then? Doctor: We used a concept that is routinely used in transradial percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We extended the shuttle sheath with a guide extension catheter to enhance support. Then, we advanced a 2.5-mm balloon into the guide extension catheter. Patient: Oh, I remember the balloon-assisted tracking. Doctor: Exactly. We performed balloon-assisted tracking of the guide extension catheter into your left ICA beyond the point where the retrieval catheter was hanging up. After that, we were able to advance the retrieval catheter successfully. Patient: I'm glad that worked out. What should I do for follow-up care? Doctor: It's important to closely monitor your symptoms, take your prescribed medications, and follow a heart-healthy lifestyle. This includes managing your hypertension, hyperlipidemia, pre-diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Additionally, you should quit smoking and limit alcohol consumption. We will also schedule regular check-ups to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll do my best to follow your advice and take care of myself. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pre-diabetes, chronic smoking, and alcoholism, presents with complaints of amaurosis fugax. The patient has a past medical history of a left occipital lobe infarct. O: Examination and diagnostic tests included a carotid duplex and computerized tomography angiography (CTA) of the head and neck, revealing high-grade left internal carotid artery stenosis. Interventional procedures were performed using a five French sheath for femoral access, AR-1 catheter for selective cannulation, and an Accunet embolic protection device. A 4-mm balloon Maverick was used for pre-dilatation, followed by the deployment of an Acculink 7 x 10 x 40-mm stent and post-dilatation with a 5-mm balloon. Challenges were encountered with the EPD retrieval system, which were overcome by using a balloon-assisted tracking technique. A: The primary diagnosis is high-grade left internal carotid artery stenosis, complicated by previous left occipital lobe infarct and amaurosis fugax. The successful stent placement and resolution of the EPD retrieval issue indicate a positive immediate procedural outcome. However, the patient's extensive comorbid conditions necessitate ongoing management and surveillance. P: The patient is advised to closely monitor symptoms and adhere to prescribed medications. Lifestyle modifications are recommended, including a heart-healthy diet, smoking cessation, and limiting alcohol intake. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. The patient is encouraged to maintain compliance with the management plan to prevent further complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, can you please describe the symptoms you've been experiencing recently? Patient: Yeah, I suddenly started having a really severe and continuous headache about 4 days ago, and I've been vomiting too. My behaviour has been a bit off as well, like I've been acting in a disinhibited way and using offensive language towards my family members. I've also had urinary incontinence. Doctor: I see. Let's do a thorough examination. [After examination] It appears that you have multiple neurofibromata, café au lait spots, and Leish nodules of the iris. Is there a family history of NF? Patient: No, there's no family history of NF. Doctor: Alright. There are no features of meningism or any focal neurological signs. However, we were unable to assess your memory, higher functions, and frontal lobe functions properly on admission due to your behaviour. We'll need to do some tests. [After tests] Your full blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests, thyroid function tests, and inflammatory markers are all normal. Patient: Okay, that's good to hear. Doctor: We also did a noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) scan of your brain on admission, which revealed hypodense areas in both frontal lobes. We followed up with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, which showed the absence of cells and normal protein and sugar levels. Patient: What does that mean, exactly? Doctor: We then performed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance venogram/magnetic resonance angiogram (MRV/MRA) 10 days after the onset of your headache. It concluded bilateral frontal lobe infarcts with restriction in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) along with possible narrowing at the origins of anterior cerebral arteries (ACA) and suggesting spasms of bilateral ACA. Patient: That sounds serious. Doctor: A recent bleed at the anterior communicating artery (AComA) was also evident in the MRI and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). Additionally, a small aneurysm was seen at the left MCA. We then subjected you to a digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) 24 days after the onset of your headache, which revealed a possible ruptured aneurysm of AComA. Patient: Oh no. What are the next steps? Doctor: We'll need to closely monitor your condition and discuss treatment options with a team of specialists. In the meantime, it's important to stay in touch with your healthcare provider and report any changes in your symptoms or new symptoms that may arise. Patient: Alright, I understand. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to help you through this. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. [/INST] S: The patient reports a sudden onset of severe, continuous headache starting 4 days ago, accompanied by vomiting, disinhibited behavior, offensive language towards family, and urinary incontinence. No family history of neurofibromatosis (NF) is reported. O: Physical examination revealed multiple neurofibromata, café au lait spots, and Lisch nodules of the iris. No signs of meningism or focal neurological deficits were noted. Initial inability to assess memory and higher functions due to patient's behavior. Laboratory tests including full blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests, thyroid function tests, and inflammatory markers were normal. Initial NCCT showed hypodense areas in both frontal lobes. CSF analysis was normal. Subsequent MRI and MRV/MRA indicated bilateral frontal lobe infarcts, possible narrowing at the origins of anterior cerebral arteries, and recent bleed at the anterior communicating artery with a small aneurysm at the left middle cerebral artery. DSA confirmed a possible ruptured aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery. A: Primary diagnosis of cerebral aneurysm with associated hemorrhage and vasospasm. Differential diagnosis includes complications from neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) given the presence of neurofibromata and other characteristic findings, though no family history is present. The prognosis depends on the management of the aneurysm and prevention of further complications. P: Plan to closely monitor the patient's neurological status and involve a multidisciplinary team including neurology, neurosurgery, and possibly genetics for further evaluation of NF1. Discuss surgical and medical treatment options for the aneurysm. Educate the patient on the importance of monitoring symptoms and maintaining regular follow-up. Ensure the patient understands the need to report any new or worsening symptoms immediately. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I understand you've noticed a mass in your right breast and had an examination at a local breast clinic. They referred you to our hospital for further investigation. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Before we proceed, let's discuss your medical history. I see that you have a history of early gastric cancer and early esophageal cancer. Do you have any family history of cancer? Patient: Yeah, my younger sister had breast cancer, and my grandfather had gastric cancer. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Now, let's discuss the results of your mammography. It revealed a 1.5-cm coarse heterogeneously high-density calcified lesion at the upper outer portion of your right breast. Have you seen the image? (Fig. a) Patient: Yes, I've seen it. Doctor: Ultrasonography (US) showed a hypoechoic mass containing multiple calcifications with relatively smooth borders. The internal characteristics were unclear due to the calcifications (Fig. ). Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the tumor showed small clusters of either normal or benign epithelial cells without any marked atypia. Since no malignancy was noted, we did not perform a core needle biopsy, and the patient was subsequently followed up. Patient: Okay, so what's the next step? Doctor: About 8 months after our first medical examination, mammography revealed a slight enlargement of the coarse calcification (Fig. b), but US showed the same size tumor. About 13 months after our first medical examination, the mass was 2.3 cm in size. Patient: Oh, so it's growing? Doctor: Yes, and after another 3 months, it had grown to 4.5 cm, and new coarse calcifications that were irregular in shape and different in density from the initial one appeared around the enlarged original coarse calcified tumor on mammography (Fig. c, d). US showed a mass that was covered by coarse calcifications which had remarkably increased in size. Patient: That doesn't sound good. Doctor: MRI revealed a 4.5-cm mass at the upper outer portion of the right breast. Fat suppression (FS)-T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) showed a high signal intensity at the periphery and center of the tumor. Gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced FS-T1WI showed a high signal intensity at the periphery of the tumor but a low signal intensity in the central area (Fig. a–c). A core needle biopsy showed a nodule. Patient: What does all that mean, doctor? Doctor: The test results indicate that the mass in your breast has grown and changed in appearance. We need to monitor it closely and discuss potential treatment options. Patient: What should I do next? Doctor: We'll schedule regular follow-up examinations to monitor the mass, and I'll discuss your case with our team to determine the best course of action. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact us if you notice any changes or have concerns. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient reports noticing a mass in her right breast, which was initially examined at a local breast clinic and subsequently referred to our hospital for further evaluation. She has a personal history of early gastric and esophageal cancers and a family history of breast and gastric cancers. The patient has been monitored over time, noting changes in the size and characteristics of the breast mass. O: Initial mammography showed a 1.5-cm coarse heterogeneously high-density calcified lesion in the upper outer portion of the right breast. Follow-up mammography 8 months later showed slight enlargement of the calcification, and at 13 months, the mass measured 2.3 cm. After 16 months, the mass grew to 4.5 cm with new irregular coarse calcifications. Ultrasonography confirmed the growth and changes in calcifications. MRI findings included a 4.5-cm mass with high signal intensity on FS-T2WI and mixed signal intensity on Gd-enhanced FS-T1WI. Fine-needle aspiration cytology initially showed benign epithelial cells, but a later core needle biopsy was performed due to the growth and changes in the mass. A: The primary assessment is a progressively enlarging and changing breast mass in the context of a significant personal and family cancer history. The differential diagnosis includes benign breast disease versus malignant transformation, given the rapid growth and changing characteristics of the calcifications. P: Plan to continue regular follow-up examinations to closely monitor the mass. Schedule an interdisciplinary team discussion to review the case and determine the best course of treatment. Educate the patient on the importance of monitoring for any new symptoms or changes and ensure she understands how to contact our team if concerns arise. Consider genetic counseling given the family history of cancer to assess hereditary cancer risk. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been diagnosed with temporal arteritis. I had a biopsy of my temporal artery, which showed granulomatous inflammation. Doctor: I see. Were there any other findings in your tests? Patient: Yes, the chest HRCT showed changes similar to autoimmune ILD. They considered pulmonary TB, but the smears and microscopy were negative. Doctor: Okay, so you started treatment with methylprednisolone for the arteritis, right? Patient: Yes, I started taking 8 mg of it daily, more than half a year ago. I was also taking amiodarone tablets, 400 mg daily, for recurrent atrial fibrillation since 2002. Doctor: Have you experienced any new symptoms recently? Patient: I've had fever and dyspnea. When I went to the rheumatology outpatient department, they told me my parameters of central hemodynamics were normal, and my ECG showed sinus rhythm. They also said my C-reactive protein was 118 mg/l. Doctor: It seems you have bilateral pneumonia, consistent with pulmonary vasculitis. This was established with a chest X-ray, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. I was admitted to the rheumatology department and they prescribed empiric antibiotic therapy with cefuroxime, 4.5 g daily, and increased my methylprednisolone dose to 32 mg daily for suspected exacerbation of vasculitis. Doctor: How have you been feeling since starting this new treatment? Patient: On the third day of hospitalization, I complained of malaise, pressure, and tightness in my chest. They did an ECG and identified AF again, so they transferred me to the Intensive Care Unit for direct current cardioversion into sinus rhythm. Doctor: Were you able to return to the rheumatology department afterwards? Patient: Yes, I was transferred back successfully. But after 24 hours, I had another episode of AF. They checked my electrolytes, which were in the normal range, and then prescribed 300 mg amiodarone IV solution for pharmacological conversion. Doctor: How did you feel after that? Patient: I still had severe dyspnea, tachypnea, and signs of respiratory insufficiency. The doctors had a consult and concluded that I might be suffering from autoimmune interstitial lung disease, drug-induced lung injury, or a bacterial infection. Doctor: So, what was decided for your treatment? Patient: They decided to discontinue amiodarone therapy, start corticosteroid therapy, and repeat bronchoscopy. They also wanted to take sputum smears and bronchial washings to check for infection. Doctor: That sounds like a comprehensive plan. Please keep me updated on your progress, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. Take care. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, previously diagnosed with temporal arteritis confirmed by biopsy showing granulomatous inflammation, reports new symptoms of fever and dyspnea. The patient has a history of recurrent atrial fibrillation treated with amiodarone since 2002 and has been on methylprednisolone for over six months for arteritis. Recent exacerbation of symptoms led to hospitalization and diagnosis of bilateral pneumonia and suspected pulmonary vasculitis. O: Recent hospital tests revealed C-reactive protein at 118 mg/l (normal <10 mg/l), normal central hemodynamics, and sinus rhythm on ECG. Chest X-ray confirmed bilateral pneumonia. The patient was treated with cefuroxime 4.5 g daily and an increased dose of methylprednisolone to 32 mg daily. Subsequent episodes of atrial fibrillation were managed with direct current cardioversion and amiodarone IV. Electrolytes were within normal ranges. A: Primary diagnosis of exacerbated temporal arteritis with complications including bilateral pneumonia and suspected pulmonary vasculitis. Differential diagnoses include autoimmune interstitial lung disease, drug-induced lung injury, and bacterial infection. The recurrent atrial fibrillation and potential adverse effects from long-term amiodarone use are noted. P: The current treatment plan includes discontinuation of amiodarone, continuation of increased dose corticosteroid therapy, and empirical antibiotic therapy with cefuroxime. Further diagnostic procedures such as repeat bronchoscopy, sputum smears, and bronchial washings are planned to refine the diagnosis and adjust treatment. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and cardiac rhythm is essential, with adjustments to therapy as needed based on ongoing assessments and test results. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having this persistent ocular-nasal catarrh for about three months now, along with a sub-febrile state, myalgia, night sweats, weight loss, and early daily bi-temporal pain. Doctor: I see. Let's review your test results to better understand your condition. Your blood tests show a severe biological inflammatory syndrome with CRP at 105 mg/l and sedimentation rate at 97 mm.  Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We performed a Colour Doppler Ultrasound (CDU) and found a typical inflammatory “halo sign” in your temporal arteries, common carotid, and vertebral arteries. The intima remained visible in the images. Patient: What does that mean, exactly? Doctor: The halo sign is an indication of inflammation in your arteries. We also conducted a Computed Tomography (CT) angiography, which revealed thickening of the walls of your aortic arch and its large emerging arteries, as well as your axillary arteries. There was also moderate thickening of your abdominal visceral aorta. Patient: So, what's causing all this? Doctor: We performed a Temporal artery biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. The results showed that you have giant cell arteritis (GCA), which is causing chronic lymphocytic inflammation in your arteries. Reactive intimal hyperplasia was also found, causing luminal collapse, fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina, and the presence of giant cells. Patient: That sounds very serious. What can be done to treat it? Doctor: Don't worry, we have started you on a classical massive corticosteroid treatment, which should lead to rapid clinical and biological improvement.  Patient: How long will it take for me to see improvements? Doctor: Over the course of your treatment, you should start to see significant improvements. In fact, after nine months of treatment, the halo sign and diffuse arterial thickening had nearly completely resolved in a similar case. Patient: That's reassuring to hear. Thank you, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. Remember to follow the prescribed treatment and come in for regular check-ups so we can monitor your progress. If you have any concerns or experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact us. Patient: Will do. Thanks again for your help and explanations.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see in your history that you have schizoaffective disorder and HIV. You reported a painful penile erection after taking a single dose of sertraline 50 mg. Can you tell me more about that? Patient: Yeah, it was really painful and lasted about 5-6 hours. I didn't seek any medical help, and it went away on its own. Doctor: I see. You were also taking trazodone 50 mg, bupropion 450 mg, and aripiprazole 10 mg for the past few years, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: During your previous visit, sertraline 50 mg was added to target your depressive symptoms. After the episode of priapism, did you stop taking sertraline? Patient: Yes, I stopped it, and it didn't happen again. Doctor: I understand. Your HIV medications include dolutegravir (Tivicay) 50 mg daily and emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (Truvada) 200/300mg, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: You mentioned that you were very distressed and embarrassed by this episode of priapism. Have you had any substance abuse or other medical problems related to this? Patient: No, I haven't had any substance abuse or other medical issues. Doctor: That's good to hear. Do you have any suicidal or homicidal thoughts? Patient: No, I don't have any of those thoughts. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. We checked your labs, and they were unremarkable. Your CD4 count was 514. You don't have any risk factors like sickle cell disease, oncological malignancy, blood dyscrasias, penile trauma, pelvic injury, or prior episodes of priapism, right? Patient: No, I don't have any of those risk factors. Doctor: That's good. Since you stopped taking sertraline and the priapism did not occur again, it seems that the sertraline may have been the cause. We'll need to find an alternative medication for your depressive symptoms without this side effect. In the meantime, please continue taking your other medications as prescribed. If you experience any similar issues in the future, please contact us immediately. Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of schizoaffective disorder and HIV, reported a painful penile erection lasting 5-6 hours after taking a single dose of sertraline 50 mg. The episode resolved without medical intervention and did not recur after discontinuing sertraline. The patient expressed distress and embarrassment due to the episode but denied any substance abuse, suicidal or homicidal thoughts. He has been on trazodone 50 mg, bupropion 450 mg, aripiprazole 10 mg, dolutegravir 50 mg daily, and emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil 200/300mg. O: Vital signs and lab results were unremarkable. CD4 count was 514. No risk factors for priapism such as sickle cell disease, oncological malignancy, blood dyscrasias, penile trauma, pelvic injury, or prior episodes were reported. A: The primary diagnosis is drug-induced priapism, likely related to sertraline, given the temporal association and resolution upon discontinuation. Differential diagnoses include priapism related to other medications or underlying medical conditions, though less likely given the patient's history and lab findings. P: Discontinue sertraline to avoid recurrence of priapism. Monitor psychiatric symptoms and consider alternative antidepressants without priapism as a side effect. Continue other prescribed medications. Educate the patient on recognizing symptoms of priapism and the importance of prompt medical attention for future episodes. Follow up in one month to reassess mental health treatment and manage any new symptoms. </s>"

Can you tell me more about your medical history? Any surgeries or treatments in the past? Patient: Yes, I had a craniofacial resection of a Hyams grade 2 olfactory neuroblastoma about a year ago. I was having right-sided nasal obstruction, anosmia, and facial swelling for six months before that. After the surgery, I also received adjuvant radiotherapy to the primary site. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Let's see what we can find out. I would like to do an MRI to check the primary site and a restaging CT scan of your neck.  (After the tests) Doctor: Your MRI results demonstrated the primary tumor as a large, destructive mass in the right maxillary sinus. The restaging CT scan of the neck at 12 months showed hyperenhancing cervical lymphadenopathy. Patient: Oh no, what does that mean? Doctor: It means there is an abnormal enlargement of your lymph nodes in the neck area. We will perform an ultrasound examination to further investigate this. (After the ultrasound) Doctor: The ultrasound examination showed hypervascular right levels 1B and 2 lymph nodes. We used this to guide a fine-needle aspiration to collect a sample for testing. (After the aspiration results) Doctor: The test results confirmed the presence of metastatic olfactory neuroblastoma. We need to perform a right-sided comprehensive neck dissection followed by radiotherapy to your right neck. Patient: Okay, I understand. What happens after that? Doctor: After the surgery and radiotherapy, we will do a follow-up positron emission tomography (PET) scan at 3 months to check for any metastases. (After the 3-month PET scan) Doctor: The PET scan results showed T10 and left humerus metastases. However, you were asymptomatic, meaning you didn't show any symptoms related to these metastases. We provided local radiotherapy to the T10 metastasis as a treatment. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. What should I expect moving forward? Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely. Unfortunately, within the following year, your bony metastases progressed, and you subsequently passed away. My deepest condolences to your family during this difficult time. Family member: Thank you, Doctor, for your efforts and care throughout this journey. We appreciate your support. [/INST] S: The patient reported swelling on the right side of the neck.

We received a transfer request for a 29-year-old female patient who experienced pulmonary embolism 24 hours after a caesarian section. Can you tell me more about her current condition? Patient: Yeah, I'm the patient. After the caesarian section, they gave me a bolus of intravenous 5000 E Heparin. But I'm feeling very unstable now. Doctor: I see. Let me check your vitals. Your blood pressure is 90/40 mmHg, heart rate is 140 beats/min, oxygen saturation is 85%, and breathing rate is 30 breaths/min. You are afebrile with a temperature of 37 C. We need to transfer you to our hospital immediately. Patient: Okay, doctor.

O: Upon examination, the patient's vital signs were critical with a blood pressure of 90/40 mmHg, heart rate of 140 beats/min, oxygen saturation at 85%, and a respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min. Temperature was normal at 37 C. Cardiopulmonary arrest with pulseless electrical activity occurred, requiring CPR. Post-resuscitation, the patient was admitted to the ICU where her hematocrit dropped from 33% to 23%, and she exhibited a distended abdomen. Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage (DPL) indicated intra-abdominal bleeding. An exploratory laparotomy revealed a 5 cm liver laceration, which was surgically repaired. A: The primary diagnosis was pulmonary embolism post-caesarean section, complicated by intra-abdominal bleeding from a liver laceration and subsequent cardiopulmonary arrest. Differential diagnosis included other causes of shock and hemorrhage post-surgery. P: The patient was managed with immediate CPR and advanced life support en route to the hospital. Post-CPR, she was transferred to the ICU for close monitoring and further management. Emergency DPL followed by exploratory laparotomy was performed to address the intra-abdominal bleeding. Post-operatively, the patient was to be monitored in the ICU; however, she succumbed to complications from the massive pulmonary embolism. Family was informed and offered condolences. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've presented with a long standing ulcerated growth on your left side face. Can you tell me if you've been experiencing any other symptoms or issues? Patient: No, not really. Just this growth. Doctor: I understand. It's important to know that you have some comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension. Are you aware of any other conditions you have? Patient: Yeah, I also have an asymptomatic inguinal hernia. Doctor: Okay, thank you for that information. We've conducted a histopathological analysis, and it has confirmed that the growth is basal cell carcinoma. The good news is that the lesion did not invade the underlying bone. Patient: Oh, that's a relief. So, what's the next step? Doctor: Based on your diagnosis and general condition, we've planned a wide excision and reconstruction with a modified cervicofacial flap to remove the growth and repair the area. Patient: Is that a complicated procedure? Doctor: It's a fairly standard procedure in cases like yours. However, due to your comorbidities and being a high risk category for general anesthesia, we will be performing the entire procedure under local anesthesia. Patient: Oh, I see. What can I expect during the procedure? Doctor: You'll be awake but won't feel any pain in the area being treated. We'll administer the local anesthesia, and then perform the wide excision to remove the growth. After that, we'll perform the reconstruction using the modified cervicofacial flap to close the wound and repair the affected area. Patient: How long will the procedure take? Doctor: The procedure itself should last a few hours, but you'll need to stay in the hospital for a short period after the surgery for observation and proper wound care. Patient: Alright, I understand. What should I do to prepare for the surgery? Doctor: We'll give you specific instructions before the procedure, but in general, make sure to follow any medication guidelines we provide, and keep the area around the growth clean and free of infection. Patient: Okay, I'll make sure to do that. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll see you on the day of the surgery, and if you have any questions or concerns before then, please don't hesitate to contact our office. [/INST] S: The patient presents with a longstanding ulcerated growth on the left side of the face. He reports no other symptoms related to the growth. The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and an asymptomatic inguinal hernia. O: Physical examination confirmed the presence of an ulcerated growth on the left facial region. Histopathological analysis diagnosed the growth as basal cell carcinoma without bone invasion. The patient's vital signs and other laboratory values were not provided in the dialogue. A: The primary diagnosis is basal cell carcinoma on the left side of the face. The lesion is non-invasive to the bone. Differential diagnoses were likely considered and ruled out through histopathological analysis. The patient's comorbidities of diabetes and hypertension, along with the asymptomatic inguinal hernia, are noted as additional health concerns. P: The management plan includes a wide excision of the carcinoma and reconstruction using a modified cervicofacial flap, to be performed under local anesthesia due to the patient's high-risk status for general anesthesia. Post-operative care will involve hospital observation and wound care. The patient is advised to follow pre-operative medication guidelines and maintain cleanliness of the affected area to prevent infection. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor recovery and address any complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I heard you work at a building maintenance service and were referred to our university hospital due to spontaneous bilateral groin pain that has been continuing for 1 month. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. The pain has been bothering me for a while now. Doctor: Did your previous doctor suspect an injury to the hip adductor muscle? Patient: Yes, that's what they thought it might be. Doctor: Before we discuss your test results, I need to know more about your medical history. Do you have any history of metabolic disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, impaired renal function, or use of corticosteroids? Patient: No, I don't have any of those. Doctor: I see that you smoke and drink heavily, averaging 30 cigarettes and 2000 mL of beer daily. You also work nights and have had inadequate sun exposure for more than 5 consecutive years. Have you had any falls or other trauma lately? Patient: No, I haven't had any falls or injuries lately. Doctor: Okay, during the physical examination, it was noted that you had pain with hip movements. Your height is 166 cm, weight is 55 kg, and your body mass index is 20.0 kg/m2. At presentation, there were no hip deformities found. Can you confirm the range of motion in your hips? Patient: Yes, the range of motion was 120° in flexion, 10° in extension, 30° in abduction, 20° in adduction, 40° in external rotation, and 10° in internal rotation in each hip. Doctor: Your neurovascular findings were normal for both lower extremities. The standard radiographic findings were normal, except for mild pistol grip deformity in the right hip. In the right hip, the femoral neck-shaft angle was 128° and femoral neck anteversion was 10°; those values were 127° and 9°, respectively, in the left hip. Computed tomography multiplanar reconstruction showed a herniation pit indicating cam-type femoroacetabular impingement at the lateral femoral head-neck junction. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: Bone scintigraphy showed increased uptake in both femoral necks, indicating possible stress fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis indicated fracture on the compression side of the distal portion of each femoral neck. Patient: That doesn't sound good. Doctor: No, it is concerning. Your laboratory studies showed increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (511 U/L; reference range: 115–359 U/L) and normocalcemia (9.2 mg/dL). We'll need to discuss a treatment plan and closely monitor your condition. Patient: What should I do next, then? Doctor: I'll refer you to a specialist to discuss possible treatment options and any necessary lifestyle modifications. In the meantime, try to reduce your smoking and alcohol intake and ensure you get adequate sun exposure when possible. Patient: Okay, I'll do my best. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll work together to manage your condition and improve your overall health. [/INST] S: The patient, a building maintenance worker, presents with a chief complaint of spontaneous bilateral groin pain persisting for one month. He denies any history of metabolic disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, impaired renal function, or corticosteroid use. He reports heavy smoking and alcohol consumption, along with inadequate sun exposure due to working night shifts. No recent trauma or falls were reported. O: Physical examination revealed pain with hip movements but no deformities. The patient's BMI is 20.0 kg/m2. Hip range of motion is within normal limits. Neurovascular examination of lower extremities is normal. Radiographs show a mild pistol grip deformity in the right hip. CT scan indicates cam-type femoroacetabular impingement. Bone scintigraphy suggests possible stress fractures in both femoral necks. MRI confirms fractures on the compression side of the distal portion of each femoral neck. Laboratory results show elevated alkaline phosphatase at 511 U/L and normal calcium levels at 9.2 mg/dL. A: The primary diagnosis is bilateral femoral neck stress fractures, likely exacerbated by lifestyle factors and occupational hazards. Differential diagnosis includes cam-type femoroacetabular impingement contributing to stress on the femoral necks. The elevated alkaline phosphatase may indicate bone turnover or stress response. P: Refer the patient to an orthopedic specialist for further evaluation and management of femoral neck stress fractures and potential femoroacetabular impingement. Advise the patient to reduce smoking and alcohol intake and increase sun exposure. Close monitoring of bone health and modification of occupational activities to reduce stress on the hips are recommended. Follow-up appointments will be necessary to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. How can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I have been experiencing abdominal pain for about 12 hours now. It started around my belly button and has become more severe, moving to my right lower quadrant. Doctor: I see. Is the pain accompanied by any nausea or other symptoms? Patient: Yes, I've been feeling nauseous, but I don't have any other symptoms. Doctor: Alright. Have you had any fever, weight loss, or night sweats recently? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those. Doctor: Okay, and has your past medical history been relevant to this issue? Have you been BCG-vaccinated? Patient: I've been pretty healthy and no, I'm not BCG-vaccinated. Doctor: When you arrived at the emergency department, you were conscious, oriented, and afebrile, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: During the physical examination, your vital signs were within normal range. We also performed deep palpation of your right lower quadrant, which was tender. The McBurney sign was positive. Now, let's discuss your lab results. Your hemoglobin level is 11.2 g/dL, hematocrit is 36.5, WBC count is 11,000/mm3 with 82% neutrophils and 11% lymphocytes, platelet count is 381,000/mm3, and your MCV is 71 fL/red cell. Your C-Reactive Protein level is 2 mg/dL, which is higher than the normal range. Patient: Oh, okay. What does all that mean, Doc? Doctor: Based on your symptoms and lab results, it seems consistent with appendicitis. We recommend emergency surgery without abdominal imaging. Patient: Alright, if that's what's needed. Doctor: During the surgery, we found minimal appendicular inflammation and pus in your right lower quadrant. Further exploration revealed a mass in the mesentery. There was a sealed perforation between your right colon and small intestine without spillage. We released the colon, debrided the edges, and closed the perforation. Patient: I see. What about the mass and perforation? Doctor: We took biopsies from the colon and lymph nodes and sent them for pathology to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. Patient: Okay, and what's next? Doctor: You have been started on ampicillin, gentamycin, and ceftriaxone to help with the infection. We will continue to monitor you during your postoperative period and adjust treatment as needed based on the pathology results. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing abdominal pain for approximately 12 hours, initially around the belly button and later localizing to the right lower quadrant.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 55-year-old male with multiple myeloma, and you're currently on your eighth cycle of chemotherapy with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. How have you been feeling lately? Patient: Well, doctor, for the past two weeks, I've been experiencing worsening blurriness and floaters in my right eye. It's been quite bothersome. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. I see that an outside provider noted panuveitis and retinal whitening in your right eye during an examination. They performed an anterior chamber paracentesis, which came back negative for CMV, HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, and Toxoplasmosis. Have you started any treatment for this issue? Patient: Yes, they prescribed me oral valacyclovir and topical steroids and cycloplegics for presumed acute retinal necrosis. But they referred me to your institution for further diagnostic work-up and management. Doctor: Okay, let's go over your recent lab results. Your white blood cell count is within the normal range at 9.41 k/µL, and your neutrophilic profile is at 71%. Your CMV antigen and aerobic blood culture were negative. However, your lambda light chain immunoglobulins are significantly elevated at 67.29 mg/L and your alpha-2 globulin proteins are abnormally high at 0.93 g/dL on serum electrophoresis, which is expected given your disease. Patient: Hmm, I see. Doctor: Your best-corrected visual acuity is 20/60 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Your pupils and intraocular pressures are normal. During the slit lamp examination of your right eye, we noticed mild anterior chamber flare without cell, mild cataract, and 3+ cell in the anterior vitreous.  Patient: What about the dilated funduscopic examination? Doctor: The dilated funduscopic examination revealed vitreous haze, diffuse vascular sheathing, and a poorly-defined area of inferotemporal retinal whitening without associated hemorrhage. Your left eye appears to be normal. Patient: And what about the spectral-domain optical coherence tomography? Doctor: The spectral-domain optical coherence tomography of your right eye showed no significant abnormalities aside from overlying hyperreflective vitreous debris. Patient: What did the fluorescein angiography show? Doctor: The fluorescein angiography demonstrated irregular vascular filling in your right eye. Patient: So, what's the plan moving forward, doctor? Doctor: We will continue to monitor your eye condition closely and adjust your treatment as needed. It's important to stay in close contact with us and report any changes in your vision or symptoms. We'll work together to manage your multiple myeloma and eye issues to ensure the best possible outcome. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help with this. [/INST] S: The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, currently undergoing chemotherapy. He reports worsening blurriness and floaters in his right eye over the past two weeks, which have been bothersome. He has been diagnosed with panuveitis and retinal whitening in the right eye by an outside provider. The patient has started treatment with oral valacyclovir and topical steroids and cycloplegics for presumed acute retinal necrosis. O: Recent lab results show a white blood cell count within normal limits at 9.41 k/µL, neutrophilic profile at 71%, negative CMV antigen, and negative aerobic blood culture. Lambda light chain immunoglobulins are elevated at 67.29 mg/L, and alpha-2 globulin proteins are high at 0.93 g/dL. Visual acuity is 20/60 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see from your history that you're a 68-year-old man with a history of coronary bypass grafts and stable Crohn's disease, last treated with infliximab 11 months prior to presentation. You were recently diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. I had a transurethral resection of the bladder tumour. Doctor: I also see that you underwent six weekly intra-vesical instillations of BCG and received maintenance therapy 3 months later. Can you tell me how you've been feeling lately? Patient: Well, during the second instillation of maintenance therapy, there was some difficulty inserting the catheter and I had frank haematuria after the catheterization. After 11 days, I started having fevers, sweats, shivers, generalized myalgia, and a reduced appetite. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. When you were admitted, did you have any shortness of breath on exertion, cough, or sputum production? Patient: Yeah, I had shortness of breath on exertion, but no cough or sputum production initially. I also had some pain in my right upper quadrant. Doctor: Okay, let's go over your examination results. Your oxygen saturation was 95% on air, and your chest was clinically clear. You had a palpable liver edge, and a full neurological examination came back normal. You were started on intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Some of your abnormal results included a thrombocytosis of 507x109 l−1, alkaline phosphatase of 150 U l−1 (with the normal range being 40–130), an arterial blood gas with a pO2 of 10.2 kPa on air, and a C-reactive protein raised to 90 mg l−1 (normal is <10). A chest X-ray showed micronodular shadowing in the mid- and lower zones bilaterally. A subsequent computed tomography scan showed fine miliary shadows widespread in the lungs, consolidation at the right base, and slight enlargement of the liver.  Patient: Oh, I didn't know about all those results. Doctor: With no improvement on intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam and considering the results, we diagnosed you clinically as having probable disseminated BCGosis infection. Subsequently, you developed a productive cough and sputum. Blood and early morning urine samples were sent for mycobacterial cultures. You were started on rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyridoxine 4 days after admission. How has your temperature and cough been since starting the treatment? Patient: My temperature has gone down, and my cough has been getting better. Doctor: That's good to hear. We'll continue to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment as needed. Please keep us informed of any changes in your symptoms or if you have any concerns. [/INST] S: 68-year-old male with a history of coronary bypass grafts, stable Crohn's disease, and recent transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder treated with transurethral resection and BCG therapy. Reports difficulty with catheter insertion during second maintenance BCG instillation, followed by frank hematuria. Eleven days post-procedure, experienced fevers, sweats, shivers, generalized myalgia, reduced appetite, and shortness of breath on exertion. No initial cough or sputum production, but developed a productive cough later. Reports improvement in temperature and cough since starting treatment. O: Vital signs include oxygen saturation at 95% on air. Physical examination showed a palpable liver edge, clinically clear chest, and normal neurological examination. Lab findings revealed thrombocytosis (507x10^9/L), elevated alkaline phosphatase (150 U/L), arterial blood gas pO2 of 10.2 kPa, and raised C-reactive protein (90 mg/L). Chest X-ray and CT scan indicated micronodular shadowing and fine miliary shadows in the lungs, consolidation at the right base, and slight liver enlargement. Started on IV piperacillin/tazobactam, later switched to rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyridoxine due to lack of improvement and clinical diagnosis of disseminated BCGosis. A: Primary diagnosis of disseminated BCGosis following BCG therapy for bladder cancer. Differential diagnoses could include other infections or complications related to underlying chronic conditions. The prognosis depends on response to anti-tubercular therapy and management of underlying conditions. P: Continue current regimen of rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyridoxine. Monitor response to treatment through symptom assessment and follow-up lab tests. Educate patient on signs of potential complications and encourage adherence to the treatment plan. Schedule follow-up appointments to assess progress and adjust treatment as necessary. Consider consultation with an infectious disease specialist for management of disseminated BCGosis and a hepatologist for liver abnormalities. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I've been reviewing your case, and I wanted to discuss your course of treatment so far, as outlined in Fig. Can you please tell me about the scalp cyst you initially had? Patient: Sure, I had a painless cyst on my right posterior scalp for about 10 years. It was non-inflamed and non-draining, and it didn't change in size or fluctuance. Doctor: I see. And you first presented to your primary care provider, or PCP, to have this cyst removed for cosmetic reasons, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Initially, your PCP drained the cyst, but it recurred 6 months later. At that point, they excised the cyst and sent the tissue sample for pathology. The initial pathology report indicated high-grade invasive carcinoma with squamous features, and arising in association with a PTT. Based on these results, they referred you to a plastic surgeon for a more definitive excision of the lesion and repair of the defect. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: After the lesion was excised with negative margins, the pathology report read as invasive high-grade squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Unfortunately, eight months post resection, the lesion recurred locally, along with a palpable right posterior cervical lymph node (LN). A positron emission tomography (PET) scan demonstrated hypermetabolic activity in the posterior occiput and in a posterior neck LN. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of both the primary scalp lesion and LN were reported as SCC, similar to the primary lesion. Is that accurate? Patient: Yes, that's what they told me. Doctor: With a working diagnosis of locally advanced SCC, your care was referred to a tertiary care center. There, a dermatopathologist re-evaluated your previous biopsy specimens and altered the diagnosis from SCC to MPTT. You were then referred to a head and neck surgeon for modified radical posterior neck and lymph node dissection. Can you confirm this? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: During the surgery, the intraoperative findings uncovered the presence of nodal metastases to the posterior neck with extranodal extension, extensive perineural invasion of the spinal accessory nerve, and jugular venous invasion of the MPTT. After surgery, your case was discussed at a multi-disciplinary tumor board. Are you aware of these findings? Patient: Yes, my surgeon informed me about that. Doctor: Moving forward, it is crucial that we closely monitor your condition and follow the recommendations of the multi-disciplinary tumor board. It's important to attend all your follow-up appointments and report any new or worsening symptoms immediately. Do you have any questions or concerns? Patient: No, I understand, and I'll make sure to follow the recommendations and attend all my appointments. Thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help, and my team and I will be with you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. [/INST] S: The patient reported a history of a painless, non-inflamed, non-draining cyst on the right posterior scalp, present for about 10 years and unchanged in size or fluctuance. The cyst was initially drained for cosmetic reasons but recurred after 6 months, leading to excision and pathological examination which initially suggested high-grade invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The lesion recurred eight months post-resection with a palpable right posterior cervical lymph node. Subsequent evaluations confirmed the recurrence and metastasis of the SCC, later re-diagnosed as malignant proliferating trichilemmal tumor (MPTT). O: Initial pathology indicated high-grade invasive carcinoma with squamous features. Post-excision, pathology confirmed invasive high-grade SCC with negative margins. Recurrence was noted with local lesion and right posterior cervical lymph node involvement, confirmed by PET scan and FNA as SCC. Re-evaluation altered the diagnosis to MPTT. Intraoperative findings during subsequent surgery included nodal metastases, extranodal extension, extensive perineural invasion, and jugular venous invasion. A: The primary diagnosis is malignant proliferating trichilemmal tumor (MPTT) with local recurrence and nodal metastasis. Differential diagnosis initially included high-grade SCC. The prognosis is guarded due to the aggressive nature of the tumor and its metastatic behavior. P: The patient's management plan includes close monitoring and adherence to the multi-disciplinary tumor board's recommendations. Follow-up appointments are crucial for early detection of any further recurrence or metastasis. The patient is advised to report any new or worsening symptoms immediately. Education on the nature of the diagnosis, potential complications, and importance of follow-up care is provided. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that your son was born from your second pregnancy, right? The first pregnancy ended in an early miscarriage, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: How was the pregnancy with your son? Did you face any complications? Patient: The pregnancy had threatened spontaneous interruption, so it wasn't very smooth. Doctor: I see. And he was delivered by a scheduled Cesarean section due to your high myopia. His birth weight was 3650 g and height was 52 cm, with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: It was noted that he had hypotonia at birth. Can you tell me about his motor and speech development milestones? Patient: Hmm, his motor milestones were delayed. He held his head by 7 months, rolled from back to side at 8 months, put into a sitting position by 24 months, walked with support at 2.5 years, and walked independently at 4 years. His speech development was also delayed; at the age of 6 years, he had no words. Doctor: I see. At 8 months, he was hospitalized to the Scientific and Practical Centre of Pediatric psychoneurology. A brain computed tomography revealed signs of leukodystrophy and cortical atrophy of the frontal, parietal, and temporal areas. Were any radiological studies or neuroimaging performed before that? Patient: No, they were never performed until he was 8 months old. Doctor: At 13 months, your son was admitted to the National Medical Research Centre for Children's Health and was monitored for the next 5 years. Upon admission, a brain MRI showed signs of leukodystrophy, lissencephaly of the left occipital lobe, polymicrogyria of both frontal lobes, secondary ventriculomegaly, and brain atrophic changes with enlargement of sub-arachnoid spaces. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's what they found. Doctor: The biochemical analysis at that time showed an elevated creatine kinase (CK) level of 2024 U/L, which is higher than the normal range of 25-140 U/L. His alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was also elevated at 59 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 82 U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level at 318 U/L. Did you notice any symptoms related to these elevated levels? Patient: Not really, we just knew that he had some muscle weakness. Doctor: An electromyographic examination revealed signs of primary muscle involvement. It's essential to continue monitoring these levels and seek appropriate treatment options to manage his condition effectively. Make sure to keep up with regular check-ups and consult with specialists to ensure the best care for your son. Patient: Thank you, doctor. We'll make sure to follow your advice and keep a close eye on his condition. [/INST] S: The patient's mother reports that her son had a history of threatened spontaneous interruption during pregnancy and was delivered via Cesarean section due to her high myopia. His birth weight was 3650 g, and height was 52 cm, with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. He exhibited hypotonia at birth and experienced delayed motor and speech development milestones. He held his head by 7 months, rolled from back to side at 8 months, sat by 24 months, walked with support at 2.5 years, and independently at 4 years. By the age of 6, he had no words. The patient's mother also mentioned that no radiological studies or neuroimaging were performed before 8 months of age. O: At 8 months, a brain CT scan revealed signs of leukodystrophy and cortical atrophy in the frontal, parietal, and temporal areas. At 13 months, a brain MRI indicated leukodystrophy, lissencephaly of the left occipital lobe, polymicrogyria of both frontal lobes, secondary ventriculomegaly, and brain atrophic changes with enlargement of sub-arachnoid spaces. Biochemical analysis showed elevated creatine kinase (CK) at 2024 U/L (normal range 25-140 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 59 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 82 U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 318 U/L. An electromyographic examination revealed signs of primary muscle involvement. A: The primary diagnosis for the patient is a complex neurological disorder characterized by leukodystrophy, lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, and muscle involvement, as evidenced by delayed developmental milestones, abnormal brain imaging findings, and elevated muscle enzymes. Differential diagnoses could include other genetic or metabolic disorders that manifest with similar neurodevelopmental and muscular symptoms. P: The management plan should include regular follow-up with a pediatric neurologist and a geneticist to monitor the progression of his neurological condition and manage any complications. Physical therapy is recommended to support motor development. Speech therapy is crucial given the significant speech delays. Regular biochemical monitoring and possibly muscle biopsy should be considered to further evaluate the muscle involvement. The family should be educated about the nature of his condition, the importance of adherence to therapy and follow-up appointments, and provided with support resources for children with chronic neurological conditions. </s>"

I noticed that you seem anxious and overweight, with a BMI of 38.06. I also observed an enlarged thyroid gland, clitoromegaly, male pattern baldness, and hirsutism. I'd like to run some laboratory tests to further investigate. Patient: Okay, let me know when the results come in. Doctor: *After receiving the lab results* Your lab results show normal urea (27 mg/dL) and creatinine (1.45 mg/dL), elevated testosterone (210 ng/dL; normal range is 12-72 ng/dL), raised DHEA-S (235 μg/dL), hyperlipidemia, normal TSH (1.09 IU/mL), LH, FSH, and estradiol levels. We also conducted an abdominal ultrasound scan and uterine echotexture, which were normal, and a Pap smear that was negative. Patient: What about any scans of my brain? Doctor: We performed a CT scan of your brain which showed a normal pituitary gland. An MRI of your brain and internal auditory canal revealed a 2.1 x 1.1 x 1 x 1 cm right acoustic schwannoma in the internal auditory canal, with extension into the cerebellopontine angle cistern. It also involves the right cochlea and the vestibule, but there's no evidence of a pituitary tumor or brain compression. Patient: So, what's the next step in my treatment? Doctor: We did a trial of Leuprolide, and your elevated testosterone levels have settled. We've diagnosed you with hyperandrogenism, and the recommended treatment is a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Patient: What does the surgery involve? Doctor: It's a laparoscopic procedure where we'll remove both of your fallopian tubes and ovaries. In your case, the surgery revealed a left stromal luteoma, which is a benign ovarian tumor. Patient: I see. Thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any more questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We'll be here to support you throughout your treatment and recovery.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I understand that you were diagnosed with an osteosarcoma in your left fibula prior to your presentation here. Can you tell me more about the symptoms you experienced at that time? Patient: Yeah, I had a painful and growing mass over my left ankle. It was so bad that I couldn't put any weight on that leg. Doctor: I see. It seems that a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was done, which revealed a multicystic mass in the distal metaphyseal region of your left fibula. A core needle biopsy was performed for further evaluation. The biopsy found hypercellular spindle polygonal cells with an abundance of osteoclastic giant cells, which confirmed the tissue diagnosis of an osteosarcoma. After this diagnosis, you came to our clinic for further management. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: You underwent surgical excision of the tumor and placement of a vascularized fibular bone graft. Following the surgery, you were given 32 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin, methotrexate, and leucovorin. How did you feel after the treatment? Patient: I felt better, and I went into remission for a while. Doctor: I understand that after six months, you presented again with complaints of pain in your left leg. A bone scan was performed due to the suspicion of tumor recurrence. The results showed an intense and irregular uptake in the distal segment of your left leg, confirming the reemergence of your primary pathology. The bone scan also revealed bony metastasis in the left maxilla, left parietal bone of the skull, and greater trochanter of the left femur. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's what they told me. Doctor: Further assessment with a contrast-enhanced high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of your lungs was done. The scan found multiple soft tissue nodules of differing sizes in both lungs, some pleural-based and some with internal cavitations. The largest nodule in the right upper lobe measured 1.8 cm in diameter. These findings suggest a metastatic disease process.  Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: I understand that this is difficult news to process. Our team will work closely with you to develop a treatment plan that targets the metastatic disease and manages your symptoms. It's important to maintain open communication with us and follow up regularly so we can monitor your progress and adjust the plan as needed. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to stay in touch and follow your instructions. [/INST] S: The patient reports a history of osteosarcoma in the left fibula, initially presenting with a painful and growing mass over the left ankle, which impaired weight-bearing on the affected leg. After initial treatment including surgical excision and chemotherapy, the patient experienced a period of remission. However, six months later, the patient presented again with pain in the left leg, leading to the discovery of tumor recurrence and metastasis to the left maxilla, left parietal bone, left femur, and lungs. O: Initial MRI revealed a multicystic mass in the distal metaphyseal region of the left fibula. Biopsy confirmed osteosarcoma with hypercellular spindle polygonal cells and osteoclastic giant cells. Post-treatment, a bone scan indicated tumor recurrence with metastasis. HRCT of the lungs showed multiple nodules with the largest being 1.8 cm, suggestive of metastatic disease. A: The primary diagnosis is recurrent osteosarcoma with metastasis to the bones and lungs. The prognosis is guarded due to the extensive nature of the disease and the presence of metastases. P: The management plan includes close monitoring and a tailored treatment regimen targeting the metastatic disease. This will likely involve a combination of chemotherapy, possible radiation therapy for symptom control, and regular follow-up appointments to adjust the treatment plan as necessary. The patient is advised to maintain open communication with the healthcare team and adhere strictly to the prescribed treatment and follow-up schedule. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 77-year-old male with a past medical history of NHL/SLL diagnosed almost 10 years ago. What brings you in today? Patient: I've been having abdominal swelling, altered mental status, and difficulty in urinating with some blood in it. Doctor: I see. Let's start with a physical examination. Hmm, I can feel diffuse bulky lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Can you tell me about your oncologic history and treatment regimens? Patient: I don't remember all the details, but I know they are well explained in a table somewhere. Doctor: Okay, I'll look into that later. Now, your laboratory workup shows hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. During your hospitalization, we performed a computed tomography (CT) scan on your head, but it showed negative findings for any acute events. We're considering toxic and metabolic encephalopathy as differentials due to your altered mental status, underlying worsening of NHL, and metabolic disturbances. Patient: So what happened next? Doctor: We corrected your metabolic derangements during the hospitalization, which improved your mental status. I also noticed that your Idelalisib treatment was discontinued abruptly a week prior to this presentation due to pancytopenia and a mixed response on CT scan imaging. Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Upon admission, we did a repeat CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, which showed diffuse bulky lymphadenopathy in your abdomen. One of the nodes in the anterior para-aortic region measured about 5 cm × 5 cm × 8 cm. Your bilateral iliac, inguinal, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy also significantly increased in size compared to the prior CT scan. There was diffuse lymphadenopathy in your axillary and cervical regions as well. Patient: That doesn't sound good. Doctor: We performed a bone marrow biopsy to further investigate. It showed a cluster of differentiation 5 (CD5) and CD23 positive B-cell population, which is 37% of the lymphoid gate, and lambda-restricted. Almost all of the B-cells showed immunophenotypic expression of CLL/SLL with lambda light chain restriction, similar to your previous cases. Interestingly, we also identified a kappa light chain restricted population of monoclonal plasma cells co-expressed with CD56, which is 1.1% of total events. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: It means that your NHL/SLL is still present and active. We consulted urology for your urinary complaints of difficult voiding and hematuria. They will assess and manage your urinary issues accordingly. Regarding your NHL treatment, we'll need to discuss with your oncologist about adjusting your treatment plan, considering the findings from the CT scans and bone marrow biopsy. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything. What should I do next? Doctor: We'll arrange a follow-up appointment with your oncologist to discuss the next steps in your treatment. In the meantime, monitor your symptoms and report any changes or new symptoms immediately.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you are an 18-year-old woman currently using the combination pill as a contraceptive method, is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: How has your experience been with taking the combination pill? Patient: Well, I often forget to take it, and I'm worried it might not be effective if I keep missing doses. Doctor: I understand your concern. Adherence to pill-taking is crucial for its effectiveness. Since you're struggling with this, I would like to discuss some other contraceptive methods that are less dependent on adherence. Have you heard of injectables, vaginal rings, or hormonal IUDs? Patient: No, I haven't. Can you tell me more about them? Doctor: Sure. Injectables are a type of contraceptive that involves getting an injection every few months. The vaginal ring is a small, flexible ring that you insert into your vagina once a month. The hormonal IUD is a small, T-shaped device that's inserted into your uterus and can provide protection for several years. All of these methods are less dependent on adherence compared to the pill. Patient: Oh, I see. What do most people recommend in cases like mine? Doctor: In similar cases, more than 50% of respondents recommend using injectables, vaginal rings, or hormonal IUDs due to their lower dependence on adherence. However, it's also worth noting that nearly 30% still recommend continuing with the pill. Patient: Hmm, I think I would like to try something new. Which one of those options would you personally recommend? Doctor: All three methods have their benefits, but it ultimately depends on your preferences and lifestyle. I suggest we discuss each option in more detail and assess which one might be the best fit for you. Patient: Okay, that sounds good. Let's start with injectables. Doctor: Injectables are a convenient option since you only need to get an injection every few months. There might be some side effects, such as irregular bleeding or weight gain, but they are generally well-tolerated.  Patient: And what about the vaginal ring? Doctor: The vaginal ring is easy to use and can be inserted and removed by yourself. It needs to be replaced monthly, and side effects are usually minimal. Some women might experience vaginal irritation or discomfort, but it's generally well-tolerated as well. Patient: Lastly, tell me about the hormonal IUD. Doctor: The hormonal IUD is a long-lasting option, providing protection for up to 5 years. It can also help with heavy periods and cramping. The insertion process can be uncomfortable, and some women may experience irregular bleeding or cramping, but overall, it's a highly effective and low-maintenance method. Patient: Thank you for explaining all these options to me. I think I would like to try the hormonal IUD. Doctor: Great choice! We can schedule an appointment for the insertion procedure, and I'll provide you with more information on what to expect and how to take care of your IUD. If you have any concerns or questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient is an 18-year-old woman currently using the combination contraceptive pill. She reports often forgetting to take her pill, expressing concern about its effectiveness due to missed doses. She is interested in exploring other contraceptive options that require less adherence. O: No objective data such as vital signs, lab results, or imaging were provided during the consultation. A: The primary issue is the patient's non-adherence to the contraceptive pill, raising concerns about its effectiveness as a birth control method. Considering alternative contraceptive methods such as injectables, vaginal rings, or hormonal IUDs, which are less adherence-dependent, is appropriate. No immediate health complications were indicated. P: Plan to discuss each contraceptive option in more detail to assess which method aligns best with the patient's preferences and lifestyle. The patient expressed interest in the hormonal IUD, and an appointment will be scheduled for the insertion procedure. Provide the patient with detailed information about the IUD, including what to expect during and after insertion, and how to manage potential side effects. Encourage the patient to reach out with any questions or concerns in the interim. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've been referred to our retina clinic at the University of California Irvine for an evaluation of a macular lesion and long-standing vision drop in your left eye. Can you tell me about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble seeing well with my left eye for a while now. It's really been bothering me. Doctor: I see. Let's discuss your medical history. I understand that you have been diagnosed with PWS and are on insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus, amlodipine for hypertension, and testosterone replacement therapy for hypogonadism. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: And you had a history of strabismus surgery in your left eye when you were 2 years old, right? Patient: Yes, that's true. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Now, let's go over your test results. Your best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in your right eye and 20/150 in your left eye. Your intraocular pressure was 16 mmHg in both eyes, which is within normal range. You had full visual fields on confrontation, your eyes were orthophoric with full ocular motility in all cardinal directions, and no nystagmus was found. Your anterior segment examination was unremarkable, and no iris transillumination was noted. Patient: Okay, so what does that mean for my left eye? Doctor: Well, the fundus examination of both eyes revealed mild hypertensive retinopathy and mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). In your left eye, we found a subfoveal disciform scar surrounded by a large area of pigmentary disturbance and mottling. Patient: What did the imaging show? Doctor: The green (532 nm) fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging showed normal FAF in your right eye. However, the left eye showed an area of central decreased FAF surrounded by a ring of increased FAF, which was, in turn, surrounded by an area of decreased FAF. This triple zone corresponds to the disciform scar and surrounding areas of retinal pigment epithelial disturbance and atrophy. There was also a large area of mildly increased FAF surrounding the triple zone and occupying almost the entire macula. This area most likely corresponds to diseased retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), suggesting prior presence of subretinal fluid. Patient: And what about the angiography? Doctor: The fluorescein angiography (FA) of both eyes showed scattered microaneurysms. In your left eye, there was staining of the disciform scar, but no leakage was detected. Patient: So, what's the bottom line, doc? Doctor: Based on your test results, your left eye has a rudimentary disciform scar, retinal pigment epithelial disturbance, and atrophy. The mild hypertensive retinopathy and mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) are also present in both eyes. We will need to closely monitor your condition and will likely discuss treatment options to manage your vision and maintain your eye health. [/INST] S: The patient reports a long-standing decrease in vision in the left eye, which has been significantly bothersome. The patient has a medical history of Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with insulin, hypertension treated with amlodipine, and hypogonadism managed with testosterone replacement therapy. Additionally, the patient underwent strabismus surgery in the left eye at the age of 2. O: The patient's best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is 20/20 in the right eye and 20/150 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure is normal at 16 mmHg in both eyes. Visual fields on confrontation are full, ocular motility is full in all cardinal directions, and no nystagmus is present. The anterior segment examination is unremarkable with no iris transillumination. Fundus examination shows mild hypertensive retinopathy and mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) in both eyes. In the left eye, there is a subfoveal disciform scar with surrounding pigmentary disturbance and mottling. Green fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging of the left eye reveals a central area of decreased FAF surrounded by a ring of increased FAF and an outer area of decreased FAF, indicative of retinal pigment epithelial disturbance and atrophy. Fluorescein angiography (FA) shows scattered microaneurysms in both eyes and staining of the disciform scar in the left eye without leakage. A: The primary diagnosis for the left eye is a disciform scar with associated retinal pigment epithelial disturbance and atrophy. The patient also has mild hypertensive retinopathy and mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) in both eyes. The visual impairment in the left eye is likely exacerbated by the structural changes associated with the disciform scar and RPE disturbances. P: The management plan will include close monitoring of the patient's retinal status and visual function. Referral to a low vision specialist may be beneficial to optimize remaining vision and improve quality of life. Continued management of systemic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension is crucial to prevent further vascular damage to the retina. Patient education on the importance of maintaining strict control of blood glucose and blood pressure will be reinforced. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the progression of retinal changes and discuss potential treatment options as necessary. </s>"

I know you were admitted to the hospital 7 days ago for bacterial sinusitis and diabetic ketoacidosis. Were you discharged with any medications? Patient: Yes, I was discharged on oral doxycycline after my condition stabilized. Doctor: Okay. Let's do an assessment to check your vital signs and symptoms.  [After the examination] Doctor: Your vital signs are within normal limits, and you don't have a fever. However, I noticed marked left facial edema, erythema, and an area of grayish skin involving the left face and ear. The cranial nerve examination demonstrated a left-sided unilateral facial nerve palsy and lack of left trigeminal nerve sensation. Your left neck is tender, with palpable cervical adenopathy.  Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What about my ear? Doctor: Upon examining your left ear, I found a thickened erythematous tympanic membrane with fluid in the middle ear. There are no signs of nasal mycosis or invasive fungal rhinosinusitis on nasal endoscopy. Your left ocular examination showed preseptal cellulitis and facial nerve paralysis, but no abnormalities in vision or extraocular motion. Patient: Hmm, what do the lab tests say? Doctor: Your laboratory investigations revealed leukocytosis, elevated blood glucose (20.3 mmol/L), and diabetic ketoacidosis. A computed tomography scan showed nonspecific subcutaneous tissue stranding with no subcutaneous gas or localized collections. Maxillary sinusitis was improving when compared with imaging from your prior admission. Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: Given your symptoms and history of poorly controlled diabetes, I'm going to urgently refer you to plastic surgery for a possible necrotizing soft-tissue infection of your left orbitomaxillary region. Patient: Oh, alright. What will they do? Doctor: The plastic surgery team will transfer you to the operating room for urgent surgical exploration. They'll check for any issues with the blood vessels and surrounding tissues in the affected area. [After the surgery] Doctor: The surgery revealed thrombosis of the superficial temporal and supraorbital arteries with dry necrosis in the vascular territory supplied by these vessels. Intraoperative cultures for anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, acid-fast bacilli, and fungal organisms all demonstrated no growth. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: The absence of bacterial and fungal growth is a good sign, but we'll continue to monitor your condition closely. It's crucial that you follow up with your medical team to manage your diabetes and prevent further complications. Patient: Alright, thank you for your help, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you have a history of uterine malignancy, deep vein thrombosis, and hepatitis B. You were recently admitted as an inpatient for management of renal calculi. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been having some pain in my left knee lately. Doctor: I see. To help us determine the cause of your left knee pain, I'd like to order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your left knee. Before we proceed, I noticed that you had a recent computerized tomography (CT) scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Can you tell me more about the results? Patient: Yeah, the CT scan showed numerous partially calcified granulomas in the gluteal subcutaneous tissues on both sides. Doctor: That's correct. Additionally, a chest CT demonstrated similar findings of prior free-silicone injections within the bilateral breasts and surrounding granulomatous change. Let's focus on your left knee pain for now. We'll conduct the MRI scan and then discuss the results.  [After the MRI] Doctor: I have the results of your MRI scan. It revealed scattered, small circumscribed areas of signal abnormality in the posterior distal thigh, as well as within the subcutaneous tissues and fascia of the popliteal fossa. These round structures were low in signal on proton density, T1, and T2-weighted sequences. Patient: Oh, what does that mean, doctor? Doctor: These findings suggest that there may be some inflammation or abnormal tissue in the area causing your left knee pain. We'll need to monitor your symptoms and possibly consider further evaluation and treatment based on how your pain progresses. Patient: Okay, I understand. What should I do for now? Doctor: For the time being, try to rest your knee and avoid putting too much strain on it. You can also use over-the-counter pain relievers if needed. Make sure to schedule a follow-up appointment so we can monitor your symptoms and discuss any changes in your condition. Patient: Alright, I'll do that. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see you were admitted to our hospital complaining of abdominal pain that has persisted for 3 days. How are you feeling now? Patient: Hi doctor, the pain is still there, and it's quite uncomfortable. Doctor: I understand. You seem alert and not pale, which is a good sign. Your blood pressure is at 112/70 mmHg, and you have a regular pulse of 78 bpm. We've also conducted some laboratory tests. Your white blood cell count is 7530/μL, hemoglobin concentration is 11.0 g/dL, platelet count is 249,000/μL, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase concentration is 22 IU/L, glutamic pyruvic transaminase concentration is 9 IU/L, and lactic dehydrogenase concentration is 259 IU/L. Patient: Okay, but what does all that mean? Doctor: These numbers indicate that you're in a stable condition, but we needed to investigate the cause of your abdominal pain. We performed a computed tomography (CT) scan, which revealed a 10 × 10 × 10-cm low-density area in your mid-abdomen. Then, we conducted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and found a large abdominal cystic lesion. Patient: Oh, that sounds concerning. Doctor: It's definitely something we need to address. Interestingly, the tumor position differed notably between the CT and MRI scans, which led us to suspect an unfixed, mesenteric cystic lesion. As a result, we decided to perform a single-port laparoscopic-assisted resection instead of a conventional laparotomy. Patient: What does that involve? Doctor: A single-incision access platform and wound protector were introduced through a 1.5-cm transumbilical skin incision. During the laparoscopy, we found a large cyst derived from the greater omentum. We moved it to a position under the umbilical wound. Patient: How did you remove it? Doctor: We aspirated the cyst fluid, which was serous in nature, using a tissue adhesive called Dermabond, a suction tube with negative pressure, and a 16-gage over-the-needle catheter and syringe. This reduced the size of the tumor, and none of the cyst fluid was released into the abdominal cavity. Patient: That's a relief. What was the diagnosis? Doctor: The tumor was successfully removed via the small incision and was diagnosed histopathologically as a cystic lymphangioma. Patient: How did the surgery go? Doctor: The surgery was uneventful, and your postoperative recovery has been normal so far. Intraperitoneal cystic tumors like yours are quite rare, but we're confident that we've addressed the issue. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'm glad the procedure went well and that I'm on the road to recovery. [/INST] S: The patient, admitted with a chief complaint of persistent abdominal pain for 3 days, describes the pain as still present and quite uncomfortable. No additional symptoms were reported. O: The patient appears alert and not pale. Vital signs include blood pressure at 112/70 mmHg and a regular pulse of 78 bpm. Laboratory findings are as follows: white blood cell count 7530/μL (normal range: 4500-10,000/μL), hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL (normal range for females: 12-16 g/dL, for males: 13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelet count 249,000/μL (normal range: 150,000-450,000/μL), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase 22 IU/L (normal range: 0-40 IU/L), glutamic pyruvic transaminase 9 IU/L (normal range: 0-40 IU/L), and lactic dehydrogenase 259 IU/L (normal range: 140-280 IU/L). Imaging revealed a 10 × 10 × 10-cm low-density area in the mid-abdomen on CT and a large abdominal cystic lesion on MRI. A single-port laparoscopic-assisted resection was performed, identifying and removing a cystic lymphangioma from the greater omentum. A: The primary diagnosis is cystic lymphangioma of the greater omentum, confirmed histopathologically. The differential diagnosis initially included other intra-abdominal cystic tumors, but imaging and surgical findings confirmed the diagnosis. The prognosis is generally favorable following complete resection. P: The patient underwent successful single-port laparoscopic-assisted resection of the cystic lymphangioma. Postoperative management includes monitoring for signs of infection or recurrence, pain management, and regular follow-up appointments. The patient should maintain a balanced diet and gradually increase physical activity as tolerated. Education on recognizing symptoms of potential complications and the importance of follow-up care was provided. No further referrals are necessary at this stage. Compliance with postoperative instructions and follow-up is crucial for recovery. </s>"

Patient: Yes, the erythematous nodules have become painful and have affected my ability to walk. I also have lower extremity edema, fevers reaching 101.7°F, and rigors. Doctor: Have you tried any medications to alleviate your symptoms? Patient: I tried diphenhydramine, but it didn't help improve my symptoms. Doctor: I understand. I see that you've already visited the emergency department for an evaluation. Can you tell me about the medications you're currently taking besides olaparib? Patient: Sure, I'm also taking levothyroxine, omeprazole, and cholecalciferol. Doctor: Okay, and how did your vital signs and physical examination look during your emergency visit? Patient: They said my vital signs were within normal limits. The physical examination revealed erythematous nodules on my lower legs that were very tender to touch, and trace edema in my legs. Doctor: Were any tests done during your visit to the emergency department? Patient: Yes, they did a basic metabolic profile, complete blood count, urinalysis, chest X-ray, and blood cultures. My white blood count was 1.80, absolute neutrophil count was 1200, hemoglobin was 11.2, and platelet count was 114. Doctor: Were you admitted to the hospital after your emergency visit? Patient: Yes, I was admitted to the inpatient Hematology-Oncology service for further evaluation of neutropenic fever. Doctor: Did they find any infection during your stay? Patient: No, the infectious evaluation was unrevealing, and I remained afebrile off antibiotics. Doctor: Based on your symptoms and clinical examination, it seems that you're experiencing erythema nodosum. We will hold your olaparib treatment for now and treat the rash accordingly. Please follow up with us to monitor your condition and discuss alternative treatment options for your metastatic breast cancer. [/INST] S: Patient, a 4-year history of estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive, HER-2-negative metastatic breast cancer with deleterious 3036del4 germline BRCA2 mutation, presents with a recent onset of painful erythematous nodules on lower legs and associated symptoms of lower extremity edema, fevers up to 101.7°F, and rigors. Symptoms started three days after initiating olaparib 300 mg twice daily. Previous treatments include palbociclib and fulvestrant. Other medications include levothyroxine, omeprazole, and cholecalciferol. Diphenhydramine was ineffective in alleviating symptoms. O: Vital signs within normal limits. Physical examination showed tender erythematous nodules on lower legs and trace leg edema. Laboratory tests revealed WBC 1.80, ANC 1200, hemoglobin 11.2, platelets 114. Basic metabolic profile, urinalysis, chest X-ray, and blood cultures were performed with no signs of infection found. Patient was admitted to inpatient Hematology-Oncology for neutropenic fever evaluation, which was unrevealing for infection. A: Primary diagnosis of erythema nodosum likely secondary to olaparib, considering the temporal relationship between drug initiation and symptom onset. Differential diagnosis includes drug-induced neutropenic fever. The patient's underlying metastatic breast cancer with BRCA2 mutation and previous lymph node involvement complicates the clinical picture. P: Hold olaparib treatment and manage rash symptomatically. Monitor blood counts and manage neutropenia as per oncology guidelines. Schedule follow-up to reassess the rash and discuss alternative oncological therapies considering the patient's BRCA2 mutation and cancer profile. Educate patient on signs of infection and when to seek immediate care. Ensure patient understands the reason for holding olaparib and the importance of follow-up. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been dealing with this painful growth on the inside of my left cheek for about three months now. It's been really bothering me. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about your medical history? Have you ever used betel nut? Patient: Yes, actually, I've been using betel nut since I was a child. Doctor: Okay, that's helpful information. Have you had any other complaints related to this issue before? Patient: Yeah, about a year ago, I went to a private dental practitioner because I had a sharp tooth at the left upper back region and an ulcer on the left inner cheek. They just gave me a topical anesthetic gel for it. Doctor: I see. Let me perform an intraoral examination to better understand the issue.  (Patient nods, and the doctor performs the examination) Doctor: Based on my examination, you have a sharp tooth-26 and a 4 x 4 cm tender and indurated ulcero-proliferative growth on your left mid buccal mucosa region. I also noticed tender, hard, and fixed hemispherical-shaped lymph nodes in your left submandibular region. My provisional diagnosis is a malignant non-healing ulcero-proliferative growth. We will need to perform a biopsy to confirm this. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does the biopsy involve? Doctor: The biopsy will involve taking a small sample of the growth to examine it under a microscope to determine the type and stage of the cancer, if it is indeed cancerous. (After the biopsy results) Doctor: The biopsy results have confirmed that you have a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. According to the TNM staging, your cancer is classified as stage IVA- T4a N1 M0. Patient: Oh, no. What does that mean for me? Doctor: This means that the cancer is locally advanced, involving the nearby tissues but has not spread to distant parts of the body. We will discuss the appropriate treatment plan, which may include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. It's important to start treatment as soon as possible. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything. I'm ready to start the treatment process. Doctor: You're welcome. I'll work closely with you and your family to ensure you receive the best possible care and support throughout your treatment. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. [/INST] S: The patient reports a painful growth on the inside of his left cheek, present for approximately three months, which has been causing significant discomfort. He has a history of using betel nut since childhood and had previously visited a dental practitioner for a sharp tooth and an ulcer in the same region about a year ago, for which he received topical anesthetic treatment. O: Physical examination revealed a sharp tooth-26 and a 4 x 4 cm tender, indurated ulcero-proliferative growth on the left mid buccal mucosa. Tender, hard, and fixed hemispherical-shaped lymph nodes were noted in the left submandibular region. Biopsy results confirmed a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, staged as IVA- T4a N1 M0, indicating local advancement without distant spread. A: The primary diagnosis is well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the left buccal mucosa, stage IVA. The patient's long-term use of betel nut is a significant risk factor for his condition. Differential diagnoses considered included other forms of oral cancers or benign growths, which were ruled out by biopsy. P: The treatment plan includes surgical intervention, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy to address the local and regional spread of the cancer. The patient will be referred to an oncologist for further management and a dental surgeon for evaluation and management of the sharp tooth to prevent further trauma. Patient education will focus on the importance of treatment adherence and lifestyle modifications, including cessation of betel nut use. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor treatment progress and manage any side effects of therapy. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me what brought you to the Emergency Department today? Patient: Well, I've been experiencing bright red blood per rectum, diffuse abdominal pain, dark-colored urine, and I've been feeling really weak and tired. I also lost about 30 pounds in the last month. Doctor: I see. Have there been any changes in your bowel habits recently? Patient: No, my bowel habits have been unchanged. Doctor: Have you experienced any hematemesis or dysphagia? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those. Doctor: Have you been vomiting or had any subjective fevers lately? Patient: Yes, I've been vomiting and had some fevers too. Doctor: How about dyspnea, cough, night sweats, arthralgia, or dysuria? Any prior bleeding events? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms and no prior bleeding events either. Doctor: Okay. Have you had any episodes of recurrent infections? Patient: No, I haven't. Doctor: Can you tell me about your past medical history and if you're currently taking any medications? Patient: My past medical history is unremarkable, and I'm not taking any medications. Doctor: Do you have a history of substance abuse? Patient: No, I don't. Doctor: Can you tell me a bit about your sexual history? Patient: I've had unprotected same-sex intercourse. My last encounter was two weeks ago. Doctor: Have you had any recent travels or been in contact with anyone who's been sick? Patient: No, I haven't traveled or been around sick people. Doctor: During your physical exam, you appeared emaciated and lethargic. There was no pallor, icterus, adenopathy, or rash. Your oral examination revealed gingivitis but no thrush or sores. Your abdomen was soft and diffusely tender with no distension or guarding. We also noted a large, posterior anal fissure on your rectal exam with a minimal amount of blood. The rest of your examination was unremarkable, and we found no genital ulcers or urethral discharge. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We conducted some laboratory studies. Your normal hemoglobin at presentation dropped significantly from 14.7 g/dL to 10.3 g/dL over two days, eventually reaching as low as 8.4 g/dL after the first week. Your elevated lactate dehydrogenase is 2100 u/L, and you have a slightly increased bilirubin level of 1.3 mg/dL. These results suggest hemolysis. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: Hemolysis is a condition where your red blood cells are being destroyed more quickly than they can be replaced. Your haptoglobin levels are also low, which supports this diagnosis. We'll need to monitor your condition and conduct further tests to determine the cause of the hemolysis and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, please let us know if you experience any new symptoms or worsening of your current symptoms. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, a male with a history of unprotected same-sex intercourse, presents with bright red blood per rectum, diffuse abdominal pain, dark-colored urine, vomiting, subjective fevers, and significant weight loss of 30 pounds over the last month. He reports feeling weak and tired but denies changes in bowel habits, hematemesis, dysphagia, dyspnea, cough, night sweats, arthralgia, dysuria, recurrent infections, prior bleeding events, substance abuse, recent travel, or contact with sick individuals. His past medical history is unremarkable, and he is not on any medications. O: Physical examination shows the patient to be emaciated and lethargic, with gingivitis but no pallor, icterus, adenopathy, rash, thrush, or sores. Abdomen is soft and diffusely tender without distension or guarding. A large, posterior anal fissure with minimal blood is noted on rectal exam. No genital ulcers or urethral discharge are observed. Laboratory findings indicate a significant drop in hemoglobin from 14.7 g/dL to 8.4 g/dL over a week, elevated lactate dehydrogenase at 2100 u/L, and slightly increased bilirubin at 1.3 mg/dL. Low haptoglobin levels suggest hemolysis. A: The primary assessment is acute hemolysis, likely contributing to anemia, as evidenced by rapid decline in hemoglobin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. The presence of bright red blood per rectum and a posterior anal fissure suggests gastrointestinal bleeding as a contributing factor. Differential diagnoses include autoimmune hemolytic anemia, infections, or a hematologic malignancy. The patient's unprotected sexual activity raises concerns for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that could complicate or contribute to his clinical presentation. P: Plan to admit the patient for close monitoring and further diagnostic evaluation including a comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation profile, infectious disease screening including HIV and other STIs, and possibly a bone marrow biopsy if indicated by hematology. Initiate supportive care with hydration and transfusion of packed red blood cells to manage anemia. Gastroenterology consultation for evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding and potential endoscopy. Provide patient education regarding the importance of safe sexual practices and discuss potential need for psychiatric evaluation given significant weight loss and high-risk behaviors. Follow-up on all laboratory tests and adjust treatment plan based on results and specialist recommendations. Ensure social services involvement for support and resources upon discharge. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I came in because I've been experiencing some chronic testicular pain. Doctor: I see. Let's perform an ultrasonography of your abdomen to see if there are any issues that could be causing the pain. Patient: Okay, sounds good. Doctor: The ultrasonography detected a left renal tumor. Have you had any history of medical issues? Patient: Yes, I have a history of hypertension and left renal urolithiasis. Doctor: We'll need to do a CT scan to get a better look at the tumor. The CT showed a heterogeneous left upper pole renal tumor, which is 5.3 cm in diameter. We need to perform a laparoscopic radical nephrectomy to remove the tumor. This surgery was done in May 2008. We didn't perform a left adrenalectomy and lymph node dissection because the CT scan showed no adrenal gland invasion or lymphadenopathy. Patient: Oh, I see. What did the evaluation of the tissue show? Doctor: The histological evaluation revealed clear cell renal cell carcinoma, but with negative surgical margins. Your pathological stage was T2N0M0.  Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: Three years after your nephrectomy, you experienced a cerebrovascular accident, which changed your Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score from 0 to 2. We continued to monitor you for tumor recurrence with CT scans every 6 months. Patient: Yeah, I remember that. Doctor: At 51 months, we detected two nodules in your renal fossa, measuring 1.8 and 0.9 cm, respectively. Retroperitoneal exploration confirmed recurrent clear cell carcinoma with microscopically positive surgical margins. Patient: Oh no. Doctor: Lymph node dissection was not performed due to severe adhesion around the aorta. No lymph nodes could be detected by palpation during the surgery. Four months after the excision, an abdominal CT showed a 1.6 cm nodule over your right adrenal gland. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: Unfortunately, at that time, tumor target therapy was not covered by the national health insurance in Taiwan, so you couldn't afford the treatment until 2013. A repeat CT evaluation confirmed the disease progression of the adrenal metastasis, which had grown to 2.1 cm. Patient: So, what happened next? Doctor: You were treated with sunitinib at a dose of 37.5 mg/d for 4 weeks. However, we had to discontinue the treatment due to gastrointestinal side effects and fatigue. Patient: I remember those side effects. Doctor: After 3 months, a CT scan showed the progression of the adrenal metastasis to 3.8 cm, and no lower lung lesion was found. A chest X-ray revealed the absence of lung metastasis. Patient: That's good news, at least. Doctor: You refused to undergo a hormonal survey, biopsy, and adrenalectomy for further treatment. Eleven months after the sunitinib treatment, a CT scan showed an obvious growth of the adrenal metastasis to 5 cm. Patient: Oh, that's not good. Doctor: No, it's not. We need to discuss your options for further treatment and management of the metastasis. [/INST] S: The patient, a 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension and left renal urolithiasis, presents with chronic testicular pain. He has a significant medical history including a laparoscopic radical nephrectomy in May 2008 for a left renal tumor diagnosed as clear cell renal cell carcinoma, stage T2N0M0. Post-surgery, he experienced a cerebrovascular accident, changing his ECOG performance status from 0 to 2. He reports recurrent clear cell carcinoma confirmed by retroperitoneal exploration 51 months post-nephrectomy, with microscopically positive surgical margins and subsequent adrenal metastasis. O: Initial ultrasonography revealed a left renal tumor. CT scans confirmed a heterogeneous left upper pole renal tumor (5.3 cm), recurrent nodules in the renal fossa (1.8 cm and 0.9 cm), and a growing right adrenal gland nodule (initially 1.6 cm, progressing to 5 cm). Histological evaluation post-nephrectomy showed clear cell renal cell carcinoma with negative surgical margins. No lymphadenopathy or adrenal gland invasion was noted initially. Recent imaging showed no lung metastasis. A: The primary diagnosis is recurrent clear cell renal cell carcinoma with adrenal metastasis. The patient's history of cerebrovascular accident and performance status deterioration complicates his prognosis and treatment options. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of metastatic renal cell carcinoma or secondary malignancies, though current findings support the primary diagnosis. P: The management plan includes discussing further treatment options for the adrenal metastasis, considering the patient's refusal of hormonal survey, biopsy, and adrenalectomy. Previous treatment with sunitinib was discontinued due to adverse effects. Continuous monitoring with CT scans is recommended, and patient education on the importance of considering all potential treatments to manage disease progression is crucial. Referral to an oncologist for a review of possible systemic therapies or clinical trials is advised. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 62-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, Doc. I've been having some sub-sternal chest pain lately. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We did some tests and it seems that the chest pain is due to an anetroseptal STEMI. We performed a PCI with a drug-eluting stent to address this issue. Patient: Oh, okay. Did the tests show anything else? Doctor: Yes, we also performed a TTE which showed an EF of 15%-20%. It revealed akinesis of the mid-anterior wall, anteroseptal wall, and apex. In addition, we found two echogenic masses attached to the LV apex, consistent with LV thrombi. The larger one measures 20 mm × 12 mm. Patient: That sounds concerning. What does it mean for me? Doctor: We calculated your HAS-BLED score, which is a measure of the risk of bleeding, and it was 1. Based on this, we started you on Apixaban 5 mg twice daily, Aspirin, and Ticagrelor to help with the thrombi. Patient: Alright, I'll follow the treatment plan. What's the next step? Doctor: We'll monitor your progress and schedule a follow-up TTE in seven months to see if there's any resolution of the thrombi. Patient: Okay, sounds good. I'll make sure to follow all your instructions. Thanks, Doc. Doctor: You're welcome. Remember to take your medications as prescribed and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or experience any side effects. Patient: I will, thanks again. [Seven months later] Doctor: Hello again! How have you been feeling since our last visit? Patient: Hi, Doc. I've been following the treatment plan and feel much better. Doctor: That's great to hear. We did the follow-up TTE and I'm happy to report that it showed resolution of the thrombi. Patient: Wow, that's fantastic news! So I'm all good now? Doctor: Yes, it seems that the treatment has been effective. However, we'll continue to monitor your progress and make sure you stay on the right track. Patient: Thank you so much, I really appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out. Take care! [/INST] S: 62-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presents with sub-sternal chest pain. Reports adherence to prescribed treatment plan. O: Initial tests revealed an anteroseptal STEMI, treated with PCI and placement of a drug-eluting stent. Follow-up TTE showed an EF of 15%-20%, akinesis of the mid-anterior wall, anteroseptal wall, and apex, and two echogenic masses at the LV apex, diagnosed as LV thrombi (larger one measuring 20 mm × 12 mm). HAS-BLED score calculated at 1. Follow-up TTE seven months later showed resolution of the thrombi. A: Primary diagnosis of anteroseptal STEMI with complications including severely reduced EF and LV thrombi. Successful resolution of thrombi post-treatment with Apixaban, Aspirin, and Ticagrelor.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see you have a history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, dysphagia status post gastrostomy tube placement, chronic respiratory failure status post tracheostomy, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, doctor. For the past six days, I've been having these dark stools, and I'm quite worried about it. Doctor: I understand your concern. Let's do a physical exam and some tests to see what's going on.  [After the physical exam and tests] Doctor: Your physical exam was mostly benign, but your hemoglobin level is quite low at 7.1 g/dl, indicating acute onset anemia. Given your history of chronic musculoskeletal pain and NSAID use, I suspect you might have peptic ulcer disease secondary to NSAIDs. We'll need to perform an upper endoscopy to investigate further. [After the upper endoscopy] Doctor: The upper endoscopy demonstrated a bleeding ulcer distal to the pylorus in the duodenal bulb. We tried using endoscopic technique to remove the clot, but the procedure resulted in bleeding that couldn't be stopped despite epinephrine injections. Patient: Oh no, what can we do now? Doctor: Due to your multiple comorbidities, you're not a good candidate for surgery. We'll refer you to interventional radiology for an embolization of your gastroduodenal artery (GDA). [After the GDA embolization] Doctor: The celiac angiogram during the embolization showed no evidence of active extravasation, but there was contour irregularity at the level of the mid-GDA. We performed prophylactic coil embolization of GDA, achieving GDA stasis. Post-embolization angiography of the SMA demonstrated no evidence of bleeding from IPDA branches. Patient: I see, but how am I doing now? Doctor: Unfortunately, your hemoglobin continued to decrease to 6.8 g/dl, and you're still experiencing melena and hematemesis, resulting in hypotension. You required an additional nine units of packed red blood cells, six units of platelets, and five units of fresh frozen plasma. A computed tomographic angiography (CTA) showed a large bleed from IPDA off the SMA immediately posterior to the origin of the replaced right hepatic artery. Patient: That sounds serious. What's the next step? Doctor: We'll refer you for urgent embolization by interventional radiology. Hopefully, this will help stabilize your condition. Family Member: Thank you, doctor, for doing all you can. We appreciate it and hope for the best outcome possible. [/INST] S: Patient, with a history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, dysphagia status post gastrostomy tube placement, chronic respiratory failure status post tracheostomy, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, presents with a six-day history of dark stools. The patient expresses concern about this new symptom. O: Physical examination was mostly benign. Hemoglobin was significantly low at 7.1 g/dl, indicating acute onset anemia. Upper endoscopy revealed a bleeding ulcer in the duodenal bulb distal to the pylorus. Attempts to control bleeding with endoscopic techniques and epinephrine injections were unsuccessful. Subsequent GDA embolization showed no active extravasation but revealed contour irregularity at the mid-GDA level. Prophylactic coil embolization achieved GDA stasis. Despite these interventions, hemoglobin decreased to 6.8 g/dl, with ongoing melena and hematemesis, leading to hypotension. The patient required nine units of packed red blood cells, six units of platelets, and five units of fresh frozen plasma. CTA indicated a significant bleed from the IPDA off the SMA. A: The primary diagnosis is acute gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to a duodenal ulcer, likely exacerbated by chronic NSAID use. Differential diagnosis includes other sources of gastrointestinal bleeding given the complex presentation and history of multiple comorbidities. The prognosis is guarded due to the patient's complex medical history and the severity of the current bleeding. P: The immediate plan includes urgent referral to interventional radiology for embolization of the bleeding source identified on CTA. Continue monitoring vital signs and hemoglobin levels closely, with readiness to administer additional blood products as needed. Maintain NPO status and provide IV proton pump inhibitors to reduce gastric acid secretion. Discuss the risks and benefits of all procedures with the patient and family to ensure informed consent. Arrange for follow-up care including repeat endoscopy post-stabilization to reassess the ulcer and potential for further intervention. Educate the patient and family about the signs of rebleeding and when to seek immediate medical attention. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, patient 1. How are you feeling today? Patient: I'm just a baby, but my mom can answer for me. Doctor: Alright. So, your baby girl is of mixed ancestry, including Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic. She was born via Cesarean section at 35 weeks 5 days gestational age to a 26-year-old gravida 4 para 2 mother. Is that correct? Mother: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: The pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios starting at 21 weeks gestational age and continuing throughout the pregnancy. At 22 weeks 3 days, an intracardiac echogenic focus and nuchal thickening were noted. However, a subsequent ultrasound at 23 weeks 1 day showed the intracardiac echogenic focus and nuchal thickening had resolved, but noted a left clubfoot. Another follow-up ultrasound at 28 weeks 6 days was not consistent with left clubfoot. Were you aware of these issues during the pregnancy? Mother: Yes, we had been monitoring the situation closely. Doctor: At birth, her APGAR scores were 8 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. However, around 5 minutes, she developed respiratory distress, requiring CPAP and admission to the NICU. She has multiple anomalies and dysmorphic features, such as cleft palate, flat midface, hypertelorism, creases under her eyes, a small nose with anteverted nares, arachnodactyly of fingers and toes, laterally deviated great toes, and mild pectus carinatum. She was in the 99th percentile for a length of 53.3 cm at birth. Did you notice these issues when she was born? Mother: Yes, we noticed some of the features, but not all. Doctor: She failed her newborn hearing examination in both ears. She remained in the NICU for 6 weeks due to respiratory issues and slowing feeding. A karyotype sent at the birth hospital was normal (46, XX). During her NICU stay, a head ultrasound performed 2 days after birth showed mild prominence of the lateral ventricles and no evidence of hemorrhage. A brain MRI performed at 5 weeks of age was overall normal. At 9 weeks of age, she was evaluated for bilateral wrist contractures. Have you been following up on these issues? Mother: Yes, we have been keeping track of her progress and attending appointments. Doctor: Her family history is significant for a brother and father with similar physical features. Her 17-month-old brother, patient 2, previously presented at 1 day of life with a long neck. Are there any other family members with similar features? Mother: No, just her father and brother. Doctor: Thank you for providing this information. We will continue to monitor her progress and address any concerns as they arise. Please continue to attend scheduled appointments and keep us updated on any changes in her condition. Mother: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help and guidance. [/INST] S: The patient, a female infant of mixed ancestry, presented with multiple congenital anomalies and dysmorphic features including cleft palate, flat midface, hypertelorism, creases under her eyes, a small nose with anteverted nares, arachnodactyly of fingers and toes, laterally deviated great toes, and mild pectus carinatum. She was born prematurely at 35 weeks and 5 days via Cesarean section. The pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios and transient findings of intracardiac echogenic focus and nuchal thickening. The patient failed her newborn hearing examination in both ears and required NICU admission for respiratory distress and feeding issues. Family history is notable for similar physical features in her brother and father. O: At birth, the patient's APGAR scores were 8 at 1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes. She required CPAP for respiratory distress. A karyotype was normal (46, XX). Head ultrasound showed mild prominence of the lateral ventricles with no hemorrhage, and a brain MRI at 5 weeks was normal. She was in the 99th percentile for length at 53.3 cm at birth. She was evaluated for bilateral wrist contractures at 9 weeks of age. A: The patient presents with multiple congenital anomalies and dysmorphic features, likely part of a genetic syndrome given the family history of similar features. Differential diagnoses could include Marfan syndrome or another connective tissue disorder, though genetic testing and further evaluation are needed to confirm. The normal karyotype and brain imaging are reassuring, but her developmental trajectory needs to be closely monitored. P: Plan to continue regular pediatric follow-ups and multidisciplinary care involving genetics, orthopedics, and audiology. Genetic counseling and possibly further genetic testing will be recommended to ascertain the underlying condition and guide management. Emphasize the importance of routine developmental assessments and early intervention services to address potential delays and complications. Educate the family on signs of potential complications related to her condition, ensuring they are aware of when to seek immediate care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're a 32-year-old homeless man with a past medical history of ethanol use disorder. You've been sober for 40 days prior to this presentation, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Can you tell me what happened before you were brought in by emergency medical personnel? You were found unresponsive in a Walmart parking lot. Patient: After I regained consciousness, I remembered huffing six to ten cans of the computer cleaning product, Dust-Off. I started feeling sharp chest and neck discomfort that got worse when I took deep breaths. Doctor: I see. We initially gave you two amps of bicarbonate and empiric antibiotics to help with your symptoms. Your physical exam showed what appeared to be frostbite on the fingertips of your right hand. Have you noticed any pain or changes in your fingers lately? Patient: Yeah, my fingers have been hurting, and they look a bit frostbitten.  Doctor: Your laboratory work showed leukocytosis of 17.7 K/uL, sodium of 127 mmol/L, potassium of 3.5 mmol/L, chloride of 90 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 20 mmol/L, and creatinine of 1.63 mg/dl. Your liver enzymes were normal, and your toxicology screen was negative. However, your Troponin was elevated to 4.34 ng/mL, creatinine kinase was 1163 U/L, and CK-MB was 21.3 ng/mL. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound too good. Doctor: Don't worry; we're monitoring your condition closely. Your initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a partial right bundle branch block and a prolonged corrected QT segment (QTc) of 518 milliseconds. A chest X-ray also revealed pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium.  Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: It means that there is air around your tracheal and laryngeal structures, extending down the cervical tissue planes and into the mediastinum and pericardium. We performed a computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest, which confirmed these findings. Patient: So, what's the plan now, doc? Doctor: We consulted with cardiothoracic surgery, and the decision was made to observe your condition for now. We'll keep monitoring your vital signs and symptoms, and if necessary, we may need to take further action. It's essential to keep us informed of any changes in your symptoms or if you start feeling worse. Patient: Okay, I understand. I'll let you know if anything changes. Thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient is a 32-year-old homeless male with a history of ethanol use disorder, sober for 40 days prior to presentation. He reports inhaling 6-10 cans of Dust-Off, leading to sharp chest and neck discomfort exacerbated by deep breaths. He also notes pain and frostbite-like changes in the fingertips of his right hand. O: Physical examination revealed frostbite on the right hand's fingertips. Laboratory results showed leukocytosis (17.7 K/uL), hyponatremia (sodium 127 mmol/L), normal potassium (3.5 mmol/L), hypochloremia (chloride 90 mmol/L), metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate 20 mmol/L), and elevated creatinine (1.63 mg/dL). Liver enzymes were normal, and toxicology was negative. Elevated cardiac markers included Troponin (4.34 ng/mL), creatinine kinase (1163 U/L), and CK-MB (21.3 ng/mL). ECG indicated sinus rhythm with partial right bundle branch block and prolonged QTc (518 ms). Chest X-ray and CT scan confirmed pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium. A: The patient's clinical presentation and diagnostic findings suggest inhalant abuse leading to chemical pneumonitis, pneumomediastinum, and pneumopericardium. The elevated cardiac markers and ECG changes raise concerns for potential myocardial injury. Differential diagnoses include other causes of chest pain and elevated cardiac markers, such as myocardial infarction or pericarditis. P: The management plan includes observation and monitoring of vital signs and cardiac status. Continued administration of bicarbonate and empiric antibiotics as initiated. Cardiothoracic surgery has been consulted and recommended continued observation. The patient will be educated on the risks of inhalant abuse and the importance of reporting any worsening symptoms immediately.

Patient: Yeah, the pain and bleeding started two days ago. Before that, I had these weird purpuric spots on my lower limbs and forearms. Doctor: I understand. Did you have any other health issues recently? Patient: About a week ago, I had a viral episode that affected my nasopharyngeal sphere. Doctor: Okay. At the time of your admission, were you experiencing any fever or joint pain? Patient: No, I didn't have any fever or joint pain. Doctor: Good to know. Our physical examination revealed that your abdomen is compressible and painless, and your peristalsis is preserved. The laboratory blood tests were mostly normal, but we did find an elevated IgA level. We also noticed some subtle signs of glomerular damage, such as microscopic hematuria, mild proteinuria, and mixed cellular urinary casts. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We performed a rectosigmoidoscopy, which was normal except for some rare bloodstains. We also did a gastroscopy and found diffuse duodenal small necrotic ulcers. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: We then conducted a contrast-enhanced multidetector-row CT, which demonstrated homogenous circumferential bowel thickening in a long segment of your ileum terminal. The typical ""target sign"" pattern was present, with hypodense edema of the submucosa contrasting with hyperemia or hyperperfusion of the mucosa. We also noticed engorgement of the ileocecal mesenteric vessels with a typical comb sign. Patient: Okay, and what about my colon? Doctor: The CT showed hypodense thickening of your cecum and proximal ascending colonic wall, with a very sharp demarcation between the thickened and normal colonic wall on both conventional CT views and virtual endoscopic views. We also found a small amount of ascite in your pelvic floor and perihepatic space. Patient: What's causing all of these issues? Doctor: We performed a skin biopsy, which revealed typical signs of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Based on these findings, we have diagnosed you with Henoch-Schönlein purpura with gastrointestinal involvement. Patient: What's the treatment for that? Doctor: We will treat you with a combination of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. Your gastrointestinal symptoms should resolve within two days, and we will monitor you for any recurrence of symptoms. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. [/INST] S: The patient, presenting to the emergency department, reports colicky abdominal pain and active rectorrhagy starting two days ago. Additionally, the patient observed purpuric spots on the lower limbs and forearms prior to the onset of these symptoms. The patient had a recent viral episode affecting the nasopharyngeal area about a week ago. No fever or joint pain was reported. O: Physical examination showed a compressible, painless abdomen with preserved peristalsis. Laboratory tests indicated elevated IgA levels and signs of glomerular damage, including microscopic hematuria, mild proteinuria, and mixed cellular urinary casts. Rectosigmoidoscopy revealed rare bloodstains, and gastroscopy found diffuse duodenal small necrotic ulcers. A contrast-enhanced multidetector-row CT showed homogenous circumferential bowel thickening in the ileum terminal with a ""target sign"" pattern, engorgement of the ileocecal mesenteric vessels, and hypodense thickening of the cecum and proximal ascending colonic wall. Small amounts of ascites were noted in the pelvic floor and perihepatic space. A skin biopsy confirmed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. A: The primary diagnosis is Henoch-Schönlein purpura with gastrointestinal involvement, evidenced by abdominal symptoms, skin findings, and imaging results. Differential diagnoses were considered based on the gastrointestinal symptoms and vasculitis but were ruled out by specific findings on imaging and biopsy. P: The treatment plan includes administration of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms are expected to resolve within two days, with close monitoring for any recurrence. Education on the disease process and treatment effects will be provided to ensure understanding and compliance. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor progress and manage any potential complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you've brought your son in today for some concerns about his development. Can you tell me more about what you've noticed? Patient's Parent: Yes, he's 23 months old, and he hasn't been able to speak any meaningful words yet. He also started walking quite late, around 18 months, and even now, he walks with some instability and large strides. Doctor: I see. Let's discuss his history a bit to get a better understanding. He was born at 38 weeks gestation, correct? How was the pregnancy and delivery? Patient's Parent: Yes, that's correct. The pregnancy was unremarkable, and he was delivered by Caesarean section. Doctor: Great, thank you. I also noticed that his birth weight was 3.40 kg, which is below the 50th centile, while his birth length was 52 cm, which is above the 75th centile. Did he have any complications at birth? Patient's Parent: He had an umbilical hernia, but it healed by the time he was 3 months old. Doctor: I'm glad to hear it healed. As for his current growth, his height is 90 cm, and his weight is 13 kg, both below the 75th centile. When did he start sitting up on his own? Patient's Parent: He started sitting at around 8 months old. Doctor: Thank you for providing all this information. Based on his history and the symptoms you've mentioned, we performed a medical examination to assess his development. We found that he has developmental delay, sensory integration dysfunction, moderate mental retardation, and reduced cognitive ability. Patient's Parent: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What about his physical features? Doctor: We noticed a few physical features that may be related to his developmental issues. These include hypotonia, which is low muscle tone, a moon face, midface hypoplasia, deep-set eyes, epicanthal folds, a wide nasal bridge, a flat nose, a protrusible mouth, a short neck, and a longer fourth toe on his right foot. Patient's Parent: Is there anything we can do to help him? Doctor: Yes, we'll be referring him for cytogenetic studies to better understand the cause of his speech delay and mental retardation. From there, we can determine the best course of treatment and support for him. Patient's Parent: Thank you, Doctor. We appreciate your help and guidance. [/INST] S: The patient, a 23-month-old male, presented with concerns regarding developmental milestones. The parent reports that the child has not spoken any meaningful words and began walking at 18 months with noted instability and large strides. The child was born at 38 weeks via Caesarean section, with a birth weight of 3.40 kg and length of 52 cm. He had an umbilical hernia that resolved by 3 months. The child started sitting independently at 8 months. O: Current measurements show the child's height and weight below the 75th centile. Physical examination revealed developmental delay, sensory integration dysfunction, and moderate mental retardation. Notable physical features include hypotonia, moon face, midface hypoplasia, deep-set eyes, epicanthal folds, wide nasal bridge, flat nose, protrusible mouth, short neck, and a longer fourth toe on the right foot. A: The primary diagnosis is developmental delay with associated moderate mental retardation. Differential diagnoses could include genetic or chromosomal abnormalities given the physical dysmorphisms and developmental concerns. The prognosis depends on further genetic evaluation and targeted intervention. P: The management plan includes referral for cytogenetic studies to identify potential genetic or chromosomal causes of the developmental delay and mental retardation. Based on the results, a tailored treatment and support plan will be developed. The family will be provided with education regarding the child's condition and potential interventions. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the child's progress and adjust care as needed. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you were treated for fever, mild cough, and nasal discharge at another hospital. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with influenza A infection and they treated me with oseltamivir for 5 days. But my condition got worse, I started feeling more fatigue, low activity, and breathing difficulty. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. You mentioned that you were admitted to our hospital 7 days after your initial diagnosis. Have you had any history of recurrent bacterial infections or growth failure? Patient: No, I haven't had any such issues before. Doctor: Okay, let's discuss your physical examination at admission. It showed remarkable respiratory distress and consciousness disturbance (Glasgow Coma Scale, E4V3M4). Your body temperature was 38.0°C, blood pressure was 126/77 mmHg, heart rate was 155 beats/min, respiratory rate was 60 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 90% at room air. We also noticed reduced right breath sounds and detected an end-inspiratory crackle in your right upper lung. Moreover, you had red, cracked lips, strawberry tongue, and trunk and bilateral feet erythema. There was no bilateral conjunctival injection, cervical lymphadenopathy, or edema.  Patient: Hmm, that sounds concerning. Doctor: Yes, and your laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 20,000/μL with 95.1% neutrophils, hemoglobin level of 14.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 22.7 × 104/μL. Inflammatory biomarkers were elevated; C-reactive protein level was 20.54 mg/dl, procalcitonin level was 45.23 ng/mL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was 512 U/L, ferritin level was 261 ng/mL, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level was 6,176 U/mL. The levels of several cytokines were also increased: IL-1β was 1.3 pg/mL; IL-6 was 233 pg/mL; IL-10 was 67 mg/mL; and TNF-α was 2.6 pg/mL.  Patient: So what does all that mean, doc? Doctor: These results indicate a significant inflammatory response in your body, likely due to the influenza A infection. This could be the reason for your deteriorating condition, fatigue, and breathing difficulty.  Patient: What should I do now? Doctor: We will closely monitor your condition and adjust your treatment accordingly. Your medical team will provide the necessary care and support to help you recover. It's crucial for you to follow your doctor's instructions and attend any follow-up appointments to track your progress. Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to do that.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, how can I help you today? Mother: Hello doctor, my 2-month-old African American baby girl was born full term after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Her Apgar score was seven and nine at one and five minutes, respectively. In the newborn nursery, her physical exam didn't note any murmur, and her congenital cardiac screen was normal with pre-and postductal saturations at 100% on day two of life. She has no family history of congenital heart defects, arrhythmias, or other cardiac diseases. She was discharged home with me on day two of life, and we arranged follow-up with the pediatrician. Doctor: That's good to hear. How has she been doing at home? Mother: She's been stable with no respiratory distress or feeding difficulties, and she's had adequate weight gain. However, I noticed her hands and feet appearing slightly ""dark"" at home, and I was told it's normal acrocyanosis. Doctor: Yes, that's generally normal. Has she had any recent check-ups with her pediatrician? Mother: She saw the pediatrician at two separate routine office visits where no murmur or other abnormality was reported. But about three days ago, she developed a cough, congestion, and rhinorrhea. Doctor: I see. How was her last evaluation? Mother: She was due for her two-month well-child exam, so I took her to the clinic. She weighed 4.3 kg, placing her at the tenth percentile on a Center for Disease Control growth chart. The pediatrician was concerned about her visible acrocyanosis and pulse oximetry documented her oxygen saturation at 80% in room air, so she was immediately referred to an emergency department for further evaluation. Doctor: That was a good decision. What happened at the emergency department? Mother: When we arrived, she was hypoxic with oxygen saturations of 20-30% and hypothermic to 32°C. No murmurs were noted on the physical exam. They established peripheral access with a tibial intraosseous catheter and then with a peripheral intravenous line. She received a normal saline bolus, had a blood culture drawn—which remained negative—and was given a dose of ceftriaxone. Doctor: It sounds like they took the necessary steps to stabilize her. We will continue to monitor her condition closely and provide any further care needed. In the meantime, please keep a close eye on her and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or if her symptoms worsen. [/INST] S: The patient is a 2-month-old African American female who was born full term with an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. The mother reports that the baby has been stable at home with no respiratory distress or feeding difficulties and has had adequate weight gain. However, the mother noticed the baby's hands and feet appearing slightly dark, which was initially thought to be normal acrocyanosis. Recently, the baby developed a cough, congestion, and rhinorrhea. The mother is concerned about the baby's visible acrocyanosis and recent drop in oxygen saturation. O: At the last pediatric visit, the baby weighed 4.3 kg, placing her at the tenth percentile for her age. No cardiac murmurs or other abnormalities were noted. However, pulse oximetry showed an oxygen saturation of 80% in room air, prompting an emergency department referral. In the emergency department, the baby was found to be hypoxic with oxygen saturations of 20-30% and hypothermic at 32°C. Physical exam did not reveal any murmurs. The baby received a normal saline bolus, a blood culture was drawn (which remained negative), and she was administered a dose of ceftriaxone. Peripheral access was established via a tibial intraosseous catheter and a peripheral intravenous line. A: The primary assessment is acute hypoxia and hypothermia in a previously stable infant, with a differential diagnosis including congenital heart disease despite no murmur detected and no family history of cardiac issues. The significant drop in oxygen saturation and the presence of acrocyanosis raise concerns for possible underlying cardiac or pulmonary pathology. P: The patient will continue to be monitored closely in the hospital setting. Further diagnostic tests, including a chest X-ray, echocardiogram, and complete blood count, are indicated to investigate the cause of hypoxia and hypothermia. The management plan includes supportive care with oxygen supplementation and maintaining normothermia. The patient will remain on antibiotic coverage with ceftriaxone until further infectious causes can be ruled out. Follow-up with a pediatric cardiologist and a pulmonologist is recommended given the severity of the symptoms and the need for specialized assessment. The mother will be educated on signs of worsening condition and instructed to maintain close observation and regular follow-ups. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I was admitted to the hospital recently because of chest discomfort, orthopnea, and sinus tachycardia. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history? Patient: Well, I had childhood focal glomerular sclerosis with nephrosis, which was steroid resistant. I was treated with chlorambucil and recovered completely. I also get migraines occasionally. Doctor: Okay. Were you feeling healthy before your pregnancy? Patient: Yes, I was feeling healthy, but I had some adiposity and a body mass index of 32 kg/m2. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We performed a computed tomography (CT) of your chest, which ruled out pulmonary embolism, but showed signs of edema and enlargement of the left cardiac chambers. Echocardiography also confirmed severe systolic dysfunction with a left ventricular EF of 15%. Your NT-proBNP levels were elevated at 1799 ng/L, but your Troponin levels were normal. Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it's quite concerning. Due to the suspicion of life-threatening PPCM, we arranged an urgent air ambulance transport to the nearest university hospital, where a caesarian section was promptly performed, and a healthy child was delivered. Patient: I'm glad my baby is okay. Doctor: At the intensive care unit, we continued levosimendan and started standard HF treatment, including furosemide, ramipril, metoprolol, aldosterone, digoxin, and warfarin. Your ECG showed premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). After 8 days, your NT-proBNP levels dropped to 881 ng/L. Patient: That's good to hear. Doctor: Repeated echocardiography showed slight improvement; however, due to your still deteriorated EF (28%), we decided that a wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) were not necessary after extended discussions. Additionally, you developed secondary mitral insufficiency and elevated systolic right ventricular artery pressure (SPAP). Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: In the following months, you suffered from heart failure in the scale of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III A-B. Your blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg, and your NT-proBNP levels increased to 813-976 ng/L. Echocardiography confirmed an EF <30% and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) 1. Patient: What should I do now? Doctor: We will closely monitor your condition and adjust your medications as needed. It's important that you attend regular follow-up appointments with your healthcare team and report any new or worsening symptoms promptly. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, a female with a history of childhood focal glomerular sclerosis and occasional migraines, presented with chest discomfort, orthopnea, and sinus tachycardia. She was previously healthy before her pregnancy, despite having a BMI of 32 kg/m2. She was recently admitted for these symptoms and underwent a caesarian section due to suspected peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM). O: Recent imaging and tests showed no pulmonary embolism but revealed edema and left cardiac chamber enlargement. Echocardiography indicated severe systolic dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, which slightly improved to 28%. NT-proBNP levels were initially elevated at 1799 ng/L, decreased to 881 ng/L, but later fluctuated between 813-976 ng/L. Troponin levels were normal. The patient's ECG showed premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), and she developed secondary mitral insufficiency and elevated systolic right ventricular artery pressure (SPAP). Current blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. A: The primary diagnosis is PPCM with severe systolic dysfunction, complicated by secondary mitral insufficiency and elevated SPAP. The patient's condition has shown slight improvement but remains critical, evidenced by persistent low EF and elevated NT-proBNP levels. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of cardiomyopathy or myocarditis. P: Continue current heart failure (HF) treatment regimen, including levosimendan, furosemide, ramipril, metoprolol, aldosterone, digoxin, and warfarin. Regular monitoring of cardiac function through echocardiography and NT-proBNP levels is essential. The patient should maintain regular follow-up appointments to monitor her condition and medication adjustments. Education on recognizing and reporting new or worsening symptoms promptly is crucial for managing her condition. Referral to a cardiologist for specialized care and consideration of future interventions like an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) based on EF and symptomatology progression. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see you've presented with abnormal vaginal bleeding. Can you tell me more about that? Have you noticed any other symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've been having this bleeding for a while now. I haven't noticed any other symptoms, though. Doctor: Alright. Do you have any family history of similar issues or any previous medical history we should know about? Patient: No, I don't have any family history related to this, and I've been healthy otherwise. Doctor: Okay, we'll start with some tests. We performed a transvaginal ultrasonography, which revealed a tumor in your uterine cavity. An endometrial biopsy showed a papillary growth of tumor cells. We also conducted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which showed thickening of the endometrium and contrast enhancement (Fig. ). Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We also did a computed tomography (CT) scan to check for any distant metastasis, but thankfully, we didn't find any. To treat the tumor, we performed a transabdominal simple hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Patient: So, is the tumor removed now? Doctor: Yes, the resected tumor was removed, and it filled the uterine cavity with papillary excrescence. Its size was 60 mm. We performed a histopathological examination, which demonstrated a papillary architecture. The cancer had spread into the inner half of the myometrium. However, there were adnexal and perimetrium metastases. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: Based on these findings, we diagnosed you with stage IIIA (pT3aN0M0) endometrial stromal carcinoma (ESC). As a postoperative adjuvant therapy, we started combination chemotherapy of paclitaxel and carboplatin (TC). Patient: And how's that going? Doctor: Before the second cycle, we had to change the regimen to docetaxel and cisplatin (DP) because of skin eruptions induced by paclitaxel or carboplatin. You received four cycles of DP. Patient: Okay, what's next? Doctor: After 5 months, a CT scan revealed tumors in the vaginal wall and left internal iliac lymph node. We performed fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), which showed accumulation with maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of 15.4 in the vaginal wall and 5.1 in the left internal iliac lymph node. This led to the diagnosis of the first recurrence of ESC (Fig. a, b). Patient: Oh no, what do we do now? Doctor: We'll proceed with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). The chemotherapy will comprise nedaplatin and docetaxel (nedaplatin 20 mg/body plus docetaxel 20 mg/body, on day two, every week for three cycles). Concurrent radiotherapy of 66 Gy (22 fractions of 3 Gy, 5 days/week) will be delivered over 5 weeks. Patient: Alright, I hope this treatment works. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll monitor your progress closely and do our best to help you through this. [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing abnormal vaginal bleeding without any other symptoms. She denies any relevant family history and has been otherwise healthy. O: Transvaginal ultrasonography revealed a uterine cavity tumor. Endometrial biopsy indicated a papillary tumor growth. MRI showed endometrial thickening and contrast enhancement. CT scan ruled out distant metastasis. Post-surgical histopathology confirmed papillary architecture of the tumor, with invasion into the inner half of the myometrium and presence of adnexal and perimetrium metastases. Initial chemotherapy included paclitaxel and carboplatin, switched to docetaxel and cisplatin due to skin eruptions. Follow-up CT and FDG-PET after 5 months showed first recurrence with tumors in the vaginal wall and left internal iliac lymph node. A: The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIA (pT3aN0M0) endometrial stromal carcinoma (ESC). Initial treatment involved surgery and chemotherapy, followed by a recurrence detected in the vaginal wall and left internal iliac lymph node.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of progressive lower limbs weakness and difficulty in climbing stairs and posture changes. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, I've been having this weakness for about two years now. I also sometimes have difficulty swallowing. Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms or changes in your health? Patient: Not really, it has mostly been the limb weakness and occasional difficulty in swallowing. Doctor: Okay. Let's discuss your family history. Are there any cases of diabetes, cardiac conduction disorders, or ischaemic heart disease in your family? Patient: My mother had diabetes and cardiac conduction disorders. She passed away at 85. My father had ischaemic heart disease and died at 90. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. It's important to consider your personal and family history when evaluating your condition. Now let me go through the results of your neurological examination. We found mild proximal weakness in your lower and upper limbs, as well as mild neck flexor muscles weakness (MRC 4/5). Patient: Oh, okay. Doctor: We also performed a forearm ischaemic test and found basal hyperlactacidemia (42 mg/dL, reference value 4.5-19.8 mg/dL). This indicates an increased level of lactic acid in your blood. Patient: I see. Doctor: Your electromyography showed a myopathic pattern, which is consistent with muscle disease. Furthermore, your muscular CT revealed mild left femoral quadriceps and paravertebral muscles hypotrophy. Patient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We also conducted a cardiological evaluation and spirometry test, both of which were normal. Patient: That's a relief. Doctor: Yes, it's good news. Now, your muscle biopsy results showed myopathic changes with scattered ragged red and blue fibers, as well as COX negative fibers. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: These findings, along with an ultrastructural examination, confirmed the presence of mitochondrial alterations in your muscle tissue, including mitochondrial hyperplasia, ring cristae, intramitochondrial lipid inclusion, and mitochondria with transversal orientation to the myofiber. Patient: Wow, that's a lot of information. Doctor: Yes, it is. Lastly, we performed a muscular mtDNA sequencing and discovered heteroplasmic mutations m.5835G>A in the MT-TY gene, which codes for tRNA Tyrosine. This mutation was found to be heteroplasmic in your skeletal muscle. Patient: So, what does all this mean for me? Doctor: These findings suggest that you have a mitochondrial myopathy, which is a type of muscle disease caused by genetic mutations affecting the mitochondria in your muscle cells. This can explain your symptoms of limb weakness, difficulty climbing stairs, and changes in posture. Patient: What can I do to manage this condition? Doctor: It's important to work closely with your healthcare team to develop a personalized treatment plan. This may include physical therapy, medications, and regular follow-up appointments to monitor your condition. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your thorough explanation and guidance. [/INST] S: The patient reports a two-year history of progressive lower limb weakness, difficulty climbing stairs, posture changes, and occasional difficulty swallowing. Family history includes diabetes and cardiac conduction disorders in the mother, and ischaemic heart disease in the father. O: Neurological examination revealed mild proximal weakness in lower and upper limbs, and neck flexor muscles (MRC 4/5). Forearm ischaemic test showed elevated lactic acid levels at 42 mg/dL (normal range 4.5-19.8 mg/dL). Electromyography indicated a myopathic pattern. Muscular CT showed mild hypotrophy in left femoral quadriceps and paravertebral muscles. Cardiological evaluation and spirometry were normal. Muscle biopsy and ultrastructural examination revealed myopathic changes with mitochondrial alterations. Muscular mtDNA sequencing identified heteroplasmic mutations m.5835G>A in the MT-TY gene. A: The primary diagnosis is mitochondrial myopathy, evidenced by genetic mutations affecting mitochondria in muscle cells, consistent with the patient's symptoms of muscle weakness, difficulty in mobility, and swallowing. The prognosis depends on the progression of the disease and response to treatment. P: The management plan includes physical therapy to improve mobility and muscle strength, consideration of medications to manage symptoms, and regular follow-up appointments to monitor the condition. Genetic counseling may be recommended due to the hereditary nature of the condition. The patient will be educated on the nature of mitochondrial myopathies and the importance of adhering to the treatment plan.

There are no autoimmune or auto-inflammatory disorders in my family history. Doctor: Thank you for that information. We conducted some initial investigations, which showed high levels of inflammatory markers, severe microcytic anaemia, thrombocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated fibrinogen concentration and D-dimer values. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: These findings suggest a possible infection or inflammation in your body. We performed a urinalysis and found haematuria and proteinuria, but both blood and urine cultures were sterile. Patient: What about the X-rays of my legs? Doctor: The X-rays showed hyperostosis and sclerosis in the metaphysis of your right tibia, along with a periosteal reaction. This could indicate possible osteomyelitis or oncological processes in the bones. Patient: What's the treatment for this? Doctor: We initially prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics for acute osteomyelitis. However, your CRP level did not change significantly over the first few days, so we investigated other causes of acute thrombosis and inflammation. Patient: What did you find? Doctor: An abdominal ultrasound revealed a giant, homogenous pelvic mass and hydronephrosis of your left kidney. Your kidney function is quite abnormal, with a creatinine level of 185 μmol/L and urinary protein excretion of 7g over 24 hours. Patient: What will happen next? Doctor: We'll continue to monitor your condition closely, as your kidney function has further deteriorated in the past few days. We'll explore appropriate treatment options to address the thrombosis, inflammation, and kidney issues. [/INST] S: The patient, a previously healthy individual, presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of left leg pain and swelling. The patient also reported a recent fever of 38°C. There is a past medical history of a foot fracture at age 8, but no family history of autoimmune or auto-inflammatory disorders. O: Physical examination revealed swelling and pain in the left leg with reduced range of motion in the left hip. Emergency ultrasound confirmed femoral and pelvic deep vein thrombosis. Initial investigations showed high levels of inflammatory markers, severe microcytic anemia, thrombocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, elevated fibrinogen concentration, and D-dimer values. Urinalysis indicated hematuria and proteinuria, with sterile blood and urine cultures. X-rays of the legs displayed hyperostosis and sclerosis in the metaphysis of the right tibia with a periosteal reaction. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a giant homogenous pelvic mass and hydronephrosis of the left kidney. Kidney function tests showed a creatinine level of 185 μmol/L and urinary protein excretion of 7g over 24 hours. A: The primary diagnosis is deep vein thrombosis with complications including possible acute osteomyelitis and a significant pelvic mass causing hydronephrosis and deteriorating kidney function. Differential diagnoses include oncological processes in the bones and other causes of acute thrombosis and inflammation. P: The patient was admitted for further treatment and evaluation. Initial management included broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected acute osteomyelitis. Given the lack of response, further investigations into other causes of thrombosis and inflammation were conducted. The management plan will continue to focus on addressing the thrombosis, inflammation, and kidney issues, with close monitoring of kidney function and exploration of treatment options for the identified pelvic mass. Referrals to oncology and nephrology for specialized care are planned. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've been admitted to our palliative ward due to abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, the pain has been really bad, and I've been feeling nauseous and vomiting quite a bit. Doctor: I understand. You were diagnosed with metastatic pancreas carcinoma with one singular liver metastasis 18 months ago, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: It seems that you underwent first- and second-line chemotherapy regimens. Unfortunately, the latter had to be stopped due to severe side effects. Two months prior to admission, MRI scans revealed progressive disease. I see that you and your medical oncologist decided against continuing chemotherapy, opting for symptom-oriented palliative care without any further antineoplastic therapy. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, we thought it was the best choice for me at the time. Doctor: I can also see that you've been suffering from Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) for 12 years. Your symptoms have been moderate to strong, mostly in the evening and at night. Is that still the case? Patient: Yes, it's been really difficult, especially since I can't do long walks or play tennis anymore because of the cancer-related fatigue. Doctor: I understand. It looks like you initially tried treating RLS with levodopa, which provided some symptom control, but your symptoms began worsening again due to augmentation. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, it was better at first, but then it got worse. Doctor: Five years ago, you were started on a transdermal application of the dopamine-agonist rotigotine, at a dose of 4 mg per day. However, this treatment wasn't able to reduce your RLS symptoms satisfactorily. You also tried pregabalin but discontinued it due to dizziness, and oxycodone, which was stopped because of nausea and vomiting. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, those medications just didn't work for me. Doctor: Alright. So you continued using transdermal rotigotine with little effect until your admission to our palliative care unit. To assess your RLS symptom burden and pain, we will be using the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). This scale ranges from 0, which indicates no pain, to 10, representing the worst possible pain. Our staff is familiar with this scale, and it will help us to semi-quantify your RLS-symptom intensity. Patient: Okay, that sounds good. Doctor: Great. We will work closely with you to manage your symptoms and provide the best possible care during your stay here. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. Patient: Thank you, I appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome. We're here to support you and your family through this difficult time. [/INST] S: The patient reports severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. He has a history of metastatic pancreatic carcinoma diagnosed 18 months ago with one liver metastasis, and has undergone two lines of chemotherapy, which were discontinued due to severe side effects and progressive disease. The patient opted for symptom-oriented palliative care. Additionally, he has a 12-year history of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), experiencing moderate to strong symptoms, primarily in the evenings and nights. Previous treatments for RLS included levodopa, rotigotine, pregabalin, and oxycodone, all with limited success or discontinued due to side effects. O: The patient's recent MRI scans show progressive pancreatic disease. Current medications include transdermal rotigotine 4 mg/day for RLS, though it has been ineffective. The patient's symptoms will be assessed using the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain and RLS symptom intensity. A: Primary diagnosis is metastatic pancreatic carcinoma with liver metastasis, currently in palliative care due to progressive disease and cessation of chemotherapy. Differential diagnosis includes complications from the primary cancer such as bowel obstruction or liver failure. The patient also has chronic RLS, poorly controlled with current therapies. P: Continue symptom management in the palliative care setting, focusing on pain control and nausea management. Reevaluate the efficacy of current RLS treatment and consider alternative therapies or adjustments. Provide psychological support and regular assessments using the NRS to monitor symptom progression and treatment effectiveness. Engage family in care discussions and planning to ensure comprehensive support. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've been referred to our hospital for further examination due to metamorphopsia and blurred vision in your left eye. Can you tell me more about the symptoms you've been experiencing? Patient: Yes, I've been having trouble seeing clearly with my left eye. It's like things are distorted and blurry. Doctor: I see. Do you have any other medical conditions? Patient: Yes, I have hypertension and dyslipidemia. I'm currently taking oral medications for both. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Let's go over your examination results from your initial visit. Your best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in both eyes, which is within the normal range. Your spherical equivalent refraction was -10.5 diopters in your right eye and -14.0 diopters in your left eye. Your intraocular pressure was also within normal limits at 18 mm Hg in your right eye and 16 mm Hg in your left eye.  Patient: Okay, that's good to hear. Doctor: During the slit-lamp examination, we observed a slight nuclear cataract of grade 1 in both eyes, based on the Emery-Little classification. This is a very mild cataract and not uncommon for your age.  Patient: Hmm, I see. Doctor: Fundus examination revealed a tigroid fundus in both eyes, and a white, well-defined, patchy lesion superonasal to the fovea in your left eye (Fig. A). Autofluorescence showed a hypofluorescence area in the macula, which is consistent with the aforementioned lesion in your left eye (Fig. B). Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It means there's an abnormal area in the macula of your left eye. We performed an OCT scan to get a better understanding of the issue. The vertical section through the fovea showed that the sclera, which is the white part of the eye, curved posteriorly at the location superonasal to the fovea, and the choroid was thickened in that area (Fig. C). The ellipsoid zone (EZ) was disrupted between the fovea and the curved sclera. Patient: Oh, okay. Doctor: Horizontal volume scans of the OCT through the patchy lesion also showed posterior curvature of the sclera, thinning of the outer retina, and disappearance of the RPE-Bruch's membrane complex, resulting in a pseudo-fovea appearance (Fig. D). Another horizontal volume scan of the OCT demonstrated a connection of blood vessels running from the sclera to the choroid (Fig. E). Patient: So, what's the diagnosis? Doctor: There was no obvious connection between the vitreous cavity and the superior choroidal cavity with OCT. Based on these findings, we've diagnosed your condition as PCA with macular ICC. Patient: What does that mean for me? What's the next step? Doctor: PCA is a condition that affects the choroid and retina, which are essential for vision. We'll need to closely monitor your condition and provide appropriate treatment, which may include medication, laser therapy, or surgery. We'll discuss your options and develop a treatment plan based on your specific case. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing metamorphopsia and blurred vision in the left eye. The patient has a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, for which they are taking oral medications. O: Examination findings include: - Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/20 in both eyes. - Spherical equivalent refraction of -10.5 diopters in the right eye and -14.0 diopters in the left eye. - Intraocular pressure within normal limits at 18 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 mm Hg in the left eye. - Slit-lamp examination revealed a grade 1 nuclear cataract in both eyes. - Fundus examination showed a tigroid fundus and a white, well-defined, patchy lesion superonasal to the fovea in the left eye.

A: The primary diagnosis is PCA (posterior choroidal atrophy) with macular ICC (idiopathic choroidal calcification) in the left eye. The differential diagnosis would consider other causes of choroidal and retinal abnormalities, but the specific OCT findings support the primary diagnosis. P: The management plan will include close monitoring of the patient's condition with regular follow-ups. Treatment options such as medication, laser therapy, or surgery will be considered based on the progression of the condition and the patient's specific needs. The patient will be educated about the nature of PCA and ICC, the importance of monitoring visual changes, and the potential need for intervention. Referral to a retinal specialist may be necessary for further evaluation and treatment planning. Compliance with hypertension and dyslipidemia medications will also be reinforced. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, I see you were referred to our Unit for a few symptoms including high blood pressure, moon face, excess hair growth, easy bruising, headache, and weight gain. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. I've been experiencing all of those. Doctor: I also noticed you have a family history of diabetes type 2. Can you please tell me more about that? Patient: My father has diabetes type 2, and it seems to run in our family. Doctor: Alright. Based on your symptoms and family history, we conducted some tests and found that you have ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. This diagnosis was confirmed by high serum cortisol with a lack of circadian rhythm and high serum ACTH. Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean exactly? Doctor: It means that your body is producing too much cortisol, which is causing your symptoms. An MRI also showed that you have a pituitary microadenoma, which could be causing the excess cortisol production. Patient: What can be done about it? Doctor: In June 2008, you underwent transsphenoidal surgery to remove the pituitary microadenoma. The histological examination confirmed that it was a basophil adenoma. Six months after the surgery, your clinical and biochemical signs of cortisol excess significantly improved. Patient: Yes, I remember feeling much better after the surgery. Doctor: However, in January 2009, you reported new symptoms like fatigue, palpitations, and exophthalmos. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, those symptoms have been bothering me. Doctor: We performed a thyroid ultrasound which showed an increase in the size of your thyroid gland. Your FT4 and FT3 levels were high, and TSH receptor antibodies were also elevated, while your TSH was suppressed. This suggests a diagnosis of Graves' disease. Patient: Graves' disease? What is that? Doctor: Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes an overactive thyroid, leading to symptoms like the ones you have been experiencing. Patient: What's the treatment for Graves' disease? Doctor: We started you on propranolol 40 mg/day and methimazole 15 mg/day to help control the disease. This treatment should help manage your symptoms and bring your thyroid hormone levels back to normal. Patient: Okay, I hope that works. Thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. We will continue to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment as needed. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing high blood pressure, moon face, excess hair growth, easy bruising, headache, and weight gain. She has a family history of type 2 diabetes. She also reports new symptoms of fatigue, palpitations, and exophthalmos starting in January 2009. O: Initial tests confirmed ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome with high serum cortisol lacking circadian rhythm and elevated serum ACTH. MRI revealed a pituitary microadenoma. Post-surgical follow-up showed significant improvement in clinical and biochemical signs of cortisol excess. Recent thyroid ultrasound showed an enlarged thyroid gland. Lab results indicated high FT4 and FT3 levels, elevated TSH receptor antibodies, and suppressed TSH. A: Primary diagnosis is ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, with a secondary diagnosis of Graves' disease indicated by recent symptoms and thyroid function tests. The patient's history of pituitary microadenoma and recent thyroid enlargement support these diagnoses. P: The patient underwent transsphenoidal surgery in June 2008 for the pituitary microadenoma, which led to initial improvement. For the newly diagnosed Graves' disease, treatment with propranolol 40 mg/day and methimazole 15 mg/day has been initiated. Ongoing monitoring of thyroid function and adjustment of therapy will be necessary. Further education on symptom management and medication adherence will be provided, with follow-up appointments scheduled to assess treatment efficacy and adjust as needed. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see from your records that you were initially diagnosed with right primary choroidal melanoma by histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). You were treated with I-125 plaque brachytherapy in 2013, is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: In April 2016, you had an abdominal ultrasonography (US) which revealed multiple scattered hypodense lesions throughout your liver. The largest lesion was within segment 7, measuring 6.6 × 5.1 cm (M1b). Do you remember experiencing any symptoms around that time? Patient: Hmm, I can't recall any specific symptoms, but I did feel quite unwell. Doctor: A US-guided liver biopsy was performed and confirmed a recurrence. Your lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) level was 220 U/L (110-270 U/L) and your alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was 22 (7-52 U/L). In response, you started a combination of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) and nivolumab (1 mg/kg) administered every 3 weeks. After three cycles of treatment, imaging revealed the same number of hypodense lesions, with the largest lesion measuring 5.5 × 3.4 cm. How did you feel during that time? Patient: I remember feeling quite tired and weak during the treatment. Doctor: In July 2016, your treatment was stopped due to severe autoimmune colitis as a side effect of the immunotherapy. Later that year, in September, you continued with nivolumab alone (240 mg every 2 weeks) but had to discontinue it in February 2017 due to intolerance. Since then, you have received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for the hepatic lesions. How have you been feeling lately? Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling worse and more fatigued. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. In June 2017, you developed progressive disease, with an LDH of 317 U/L and ALP of 426 U/L. At this point, we decided to enroll you in hospice care to ensure you receive the best possible support. Do you have any questions or concerns about this? Patient: I understand. I just want to be as comfortable as possible. Doctor: Of course, we will do everything we can to make sure you are comfortable and well cared for. [Patient's family enters the room] Doctor: Hello, I was just discussing with your loved one their recent medical history and the decision to enroll them in hospice care due to progressive disease. Unfortunately, the patient expired within a month. Our deepest condolences for your loss. If you have any questions or need any support, please don't hesitate to ask. We are here for you. Patient's Family: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate all the efforts and care you have provided during this difficult time. [/INST] S: The patient was initially diagnosed with right primary choroidal melanoma and treated with I-125 plaque brachytherapy in 2013. In 2016, abdominal ultrasonography revealed multiple hypodense lesions in the liver, with the largest in segment 7. The patient reported feeling unwell around that time but could not recall specific symptoms. During subsequent treatments, including immunotherapy and transarterial chemoembolization, the patient experienced fatigue, weakness, and worsening symptoms. O: In 2016, a liver biopsy confirmed recurrence of melanoma. Initial labs showed LDH at 220 U/L and ALP at 22 U/L. Post-treatment imaging showed a reduction in the size of the largest lesion. However, by 2017, the patient's condition worsened with LDH rising to 317 U/L and ALP to 426 U/L, indicating progressive disease. A: The primary diagnosis is metastatic choroidal melanoma with liver involvement. The patient experienced severe autoimmune colitis as a side effect of immunotherapy and showed intolerance to subsequent treatments. The prognosis was poor, leading to the decision to enroll the patient in hospice care. P: The management plan included discontinuation of aggressive treatments and enrollment in hospice care to focus on symptom management and quality of life. The patient and family were informed about the prognosis and care options, ensuring support and comfort measures were prioritized. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, what brings you in today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having a problem with progressive hearing loss. It's been getting worse, but I don't have any dizziness or vertigo. Doctor: I see. Let's do a physical examination and a hearing test to understand the situation better.  Patient: Sure. [After the examination] Doctor: Your physical examination is normal, without any nystagmus or eye deviation. However, the Rinne tuning fork test at 512 Hz came back negative. We'll need to do a computed tomography (CT) scan to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Patient: Alright, let's do it. [After the CT scan] Doctor: The CT scan shows that you have bilateral otosclerosis and right-sided superior semicircular canal dehiscence. Your hearing loss is a mix of conductive and sensorineural. To treat the otosclerosis, we can perform a stapedectomy on your left ear, which should close the air-bone gap to less than 10 dB. Patient: Okay, let's do the surgery. [After the left-sided stapedectomy] Doctor: The surgery was successful, and it confirmed the diagnosis of otosclerosis. How do you feel about your hearing now? Patient: My left ear is much better. Can we do the same surgery on the right side? Doctor: I would advise against it. Instead, I recommend using a hearing aid for your right ear. We can do an electro-physiological assessment, including vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, video nystagmography, and video head impulse test, to monitor your condition. Patient: I think I'll avoid the surgery and use the hearing aid instead. Let's not do the physiological assessment for now. Doctor: That's fine. We can keep monitoring your progress. I would like to see you for follow-up appointments every six months. The total follow-up duration should be 2 years. Patient: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I'll see you in six months. [/INST] S: The patient reports progressive hearing loss without associated dizziness or vertigo. The patient has undergone a left-sided stapedectomy which improved hearing in the left ear. The patient opts to use a hearing aid for the right ear and declines further physiological assessments at this time. O: Physical examination was normal with no nystagmus or eye deviation. Rinne tuning fork test at 512 Hz was negative. CT scan revealed bilateral otosclerosis and right-sided superior semicircular canal dehiscence. Post-operative assessment post-stapedectomy confirmed otosclerosis diagnosis. A: Primary diagnosis is bilateral otosclerosis with additional right-sided superior semicircular canal dehiscence, presenting as mixed conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. The successful stapedectomy on the left ear confirmed otosclerosis and improved conductive hearing loss. P: Continue using a hearing aid for the right ear to manage hearing loss. Follow-up appointments are scheduled every six months for a total duration of 2 years to monitor the patient's hearing and overall ear health. Surgery for the right ear is not advised at this time. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been having this pain in my tailbone for about 6 weeks now. It started after I fell during cycling. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me how severe the pain was initially and if it has improved over time? Patient: Yes, the pain was really intense for the first 3 weeks, but then it started to get better after I took some NSAIDs. Doctor: That's good to hear. We'll need to perform an X-ray to determine the cause of your pain. Have you had one done recently? Patient: Yes, I had an X-ray taken, and it showed a type III coccyx, which was curved sharply and angulated forward. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Based on your X-ray findings and the fact that your pain has improved with conservative treatment, we can continue with the conservative approach. I would also recommend using a coccygeal pillow to help alleviate the pain. Patient: Okay, I'll try that. What exactly is causing this pain, though? Doctor: The pain you're experiencing is called Coccydynia. It can be caused by major trauma, like in your case from falling during cycling, or from repetitive minor trauma. Coccydynia is a clinical diagnosis, meaning that it doesn't always have a definite correlation with X-ray findings. Patient: Oh, I see. So, what should I do if the pain doesn't go away with conservative treatment? Doctor: If conservative treatment fails to relieve your pain, an impar ganglion block may be indicated. This procedure can help alleviate pain in patients with coccydynia. It's important to remember that the clinical response to treatment is more important than the X-ray findings, even if there is a type IV coccyx fracture or subluxation on the X-ray. Patient: I understand. When should I consider getting an impar ganglion block if the pain doesn't improve? Doctor: If your pain does not improve after following conservative treatment and using a coccygeal pillow for a reasonable amount of time, you can come back, and we can discuss the possibility of an impar ganglion block. Patient: Alright, thank you for the information. I'll continue with the conservative treatment and use the coccygeal pillow as advised. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any other concerns or if your pain persists, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care. [/INST] S: Patient reports experiencing pain in the tailbone for approximately 6 weeks, initiated by a fall during cycling. The pain was initially severe but has improved with the use of NSAIDs. The patient inquires about the cause of the pain and potential further treatment options if conservative measures fail. O: Recent X-ray indicates a type III coccyx, sharply curved and angulated forward. No other abnormalities noted on the X-ray. The patient has not reported any other symptoms or relevant medical history during this consultation. A: The primary diagnosis is Coccydynia, likely caused by trauma from the cycling accident. The improvement with NSAIDs and the X-ray findings support this diagnosis. Differential diagnoses could include fracture or subluxation of the coccyx, although clinical improvement suggests these are less likely. P: Continue conservative treatment including the use of NSAIDs as needed and the addition of a coccygeal pillow to alleviate pressure on the tailbone. Educate the patient on the nature of Coccydynia and the importance of conservative management. If symptoms persist despite these measures, consider an impar ganglion block as a next step. Follow-up is recommended if pain does not improve or worsens, at which point further diagnostic imaging or referral to a specialist may be necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I'm a 57-year-old asymptomatic man. During my routine medical examination in December 2011, I was found to have multiple intestinal masses through a computed tomography (CT) scan. Doctor: I see. What happened after that? Patient: I had a surgical resection (R0) done in December 2011. They removed a mass measuring 10.0 × 10.0 cm in maximal diameter. Doctor: Alright, and what did the final pathologic diagnosis reveal? Patient: It showed a high-risk GIST according to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) criteria. Doctor: Were you treated with any adjuvant treatment after the surgery? Patient: No, I didn't receive any adjuvant treatment because I had difficulty paying for the adjuvant imatinib therapy. Doctor: I understand. When was your next follow-up visit and what were the findings? Patient: My next follow-up visit was in May 2012. Local recurrence and metastasis were confirmed by imaging, so I was referred to West China Hospital. Doctor: What treatments did you receive at West China Hospital? Patient: In May 2012, I started taking first-line imatinib orally with a dose of 400 mg/day, and I had a partial response. Doctor: How long did you continue the imatinib treatment and what were the results? Patient: I continued imatinib for 54 months, but then disease progression occurred. Doctor: What was the next course of action? Patient: I was treated with cytoreductive surgery combined with imatinib and had a PFS of 7 months. A new biopsy confirmed KIT mutations in exons 11 and 13, which showed secondary imatinib resistance. Doctor: Did you receive any other treatments after that? Patient: Yes, in May 2017 I started second-line sunitinib treatment, but after 11 months, it was discontinued due to disease progression. Doctor: Did you consider any other treatment options at that time? Patient: I refused a biopsy for additional mutational analysis for personal reasons and didn't take regorafenib due to cost constraints. Doctor: What treatment are you currently on? Patient: I'm enrolled in a clinical trial and have been taking apatinib 500 mg daily since April 2018. Doctor: Alright. What were the findings from your most recent abdominal CT scan? Patient: The CT scans showed metastatic lesions in the abdomen and pelvic area. Doctor: Thank you for sharing this information. We will continue to monitor your condition and provide the appropriate treatment options to manage your GIST. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. [/INST] S: The patient is a 57-year-old man who initially presented as asymptomatic and was diagnosed with high-risk gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) following the discovery of multiple intestinal masses during a routine CT scan in December 2011. He underwent R0 surgical resection of a 10.0 × 10.0 cm mass. He did not receive adjuvant treatment initially due to financial constraints. Recurrence and metastasis were confirmed in May 2012. He has been treated with imatinib and sunitinib, with periods of partial response and disease progression. Currently, he is participating in a clinical trial and taking apatinib. O: Initial CT scan in 2011 revealed multiple intestinal masses. Post-surgical pathology confirmed high-risk GIST. Follow-up imaging in May 2012 showed local recurrence and metastasis. He was treated with imatinib 400 mg/day for 54 months, followed by cytoreductive surgery and continued imatinib, achieving a progression-free survival (PFS) of 7 months. Biopsy revealed KIT mutations in exons 11 and 13, indicating secondary resistance to imatinib. Sunitinib treatment was discontinued after 11 months due to progression. Most recent CT scans show metastatic lesions in the abdomen and pelvic area. A: The primary diagnosis is metastatic high-risk GIST with confirmed KIT mutations contributing to imatinib resistance. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of sarcoma, though clinical and pathological findings strongly support GIST. The prognosis is guarded due to the recurrent and metastatic nature of the disease and the development of resistance to standard therapies. P: Continue current treatment with apatinib 500 mg daily as part of a clinical trial. Monitor response through regular abdominal CT scans and clinical assessments. Consider alternative treatments or trials if progression occurs. Address financial constraints and explore options for support to ensure access to necessary treatments. Educate the patient about the importance of regular follow-up and potential side effects of ongoing therapies. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that you've been referred for orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery to correct your tooth position and jaw relations. Can you tell me about any previous treatments you've had? Patient: Yeah, I've been offered surgical treatments to correct my appearance, like tooth correction and chin augmentation. But they didn't seem good enough for what I wanted. Doctor: Alright, let's discuss your general medical history. Are there any limitations or serious illnesses that might affect orthodontic therapy combined with surgery? Patient: No, I don't have any serious illness. I just have a limping walk because of some past injuries. Doctor: I see. It's important to be honest about your health condition, as it affects the treatment plan. Have you ever withheld any information about your underlying disease or medication? Patient: To be honest, I did make inaccurate statements about my health before. I was refused treatment for my tooth anomalies when I told them about my underlying disease and medication. Doctor: Thank you for being honest now. Let's move on to your physical examination. I notice you have a relatively short stature and an asymmetrically developed face. Your maxilla seems to have hypoplasia in the sagittal plane. Have you ever noticed a slightly bluish tint in your sclera? Patient: Hmm, I didn't really pay attention to it until you mentioned it. Doctor: In our intraoral examination, we found a class III occlusion. Is your permanent dentition complete, including wisdom teeth? Patient: Yes, all my teeth are there. Doctor: Good. I also observed that your front teeth have increased translucency upon frontal illumination, specifically around the incisal edges and proximal areas. Are there any attritions of occlusal surfaces that exceed age-appropriate wear and tear? Patient: No, there aren't any. Doctor: Thank you for providing all this information. Considering your later diagnosed condition and relevant medical reports, the dental findings do not suggest any clues for DI. We will work on creating a suitable treatment plan to address your orthodontic and surgical needs. [/INST] S: The patient reports dissatisfaction with previous surgical treatment options for tooth correction and chin augmentation, seeking better results. The patient admits to previously withholding information about underlying disease and medication, which led to being refused treatment. The patient has a history of injuries causing a limping walk but denies any serious illnesses. No specific underlying diseases or medications were disclosed during this consultation. O: Physical examination reveals short stature and facial asymmetry with sagittal hypoplasia of the maxilla. Intraoral examination shows a class III occlusion and complete permanent dentition, including wisdom teeth. Increased translucency noted in the front teeth, with no excessive attrition of occlusal surfaces. No signs of dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI) were observed based on dental findings. A: The primary assessment is the need for orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery to correct class III occlusion and facial asymmetry. The patient's previous injuries and potential undisclosed medical history could complicate treatment planning. Differential diagnosis to consider includes underlying connective tissue disorders, given the facial and dental findings, although no definitive signs of DI are present. P: Plan to proceed with detailed orthodontic evaluation and planning for orthognathic surgery. Recommend genetic consultation to rule out connective tissue disorders due to facial and dental anomalies. Ensure full disclosure of medical history and current medications in future consultations to tailor treatment plans appropriately. Educate the patient on the importance of accurate health information for safe and effective treatment outcomes. Schedule follow-up appointments for ongoing assessments and adjustments to the treatment plan as needed. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm glad to see you today. I understand that you had a bilateral parotidectomy for S. of Mikulicz about 20 years ago. Can you tell me more about your past medical history? Patient: Yes, doctor. I've also had endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis, vocal cord surgery for a benign cyst, and I've been diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Now, I understand that you've been experiencing some symptoms related to Frey's Syndrome, such as reddening and sweating of the facial cutaway during stimuli that produce salivation. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. It started a few months ago and has been bothering me. Doctor: We diagnosed your Frey's Syndrome using the Minor test. We covered your preauricular area and cheek with an iodine solution, which contains 15.0 g iodine, 100.0 g castor oil, and 900.0 mL of 70% alcohol. Once dried, we applied starch powder to the area. To visualize the symptoms, you ate candy for about 8 minutes. The appearance of brown-violet areas on your skin confirmed a positive result. Patient: Oh, I remember that. So what did you do for the treatment? Doctor: We injected the affected area with botulinum toxin type A Allergan at a concentration of 50 UI/mL. We subdivided the area into 1 cm2 squares for better drug distribution and administered about 4.0 U of BTXA per cm2 intracutaneously. Patient: Hmm, and how did you know if the treatment was successful? Doctor: The subjective absence of sweating and other symptoms of the syndrome defined the success of the treatment. We performed follow-ups at 1 and 3 months, and then every 6 months to evaluate possible disadvantages that may occur, such as dry mouth, weakening of facial muscles, eyelid ptosis, facial paralysis, and short-term local reactions like pain, edema, erythema, and ecchymosis. Patient: I see. So, what happened after that? Doctor: After about 25 months from the first injection, you started to show signs of Frey's Syndrome again, which was confirmed by the repetition of the Minor test. We then repeated the botulinum injection. Patient: And how am I doing now? Doctor: To date, after three years since your last botulinum injection, you've been doing well with semi-annual follow-ups. We'll continue to monitor your progress and address any concerns that may arise. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all the help and care you've provided. [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing symptoms of Frey's Syndrome, including facial reddening and sweating during stimuli that induce salivation, which began a few months ago. The patient has a past medical history of bilateral parotidectomy for S. of Mikulicz, endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis, vocal cord surgery for a benign cyst, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. O: The diagnosis of Frey's Syndrome was confirmed using the Minor test, which showed a positive result with the appearance of brown-violet areas on the skin. The patient has been treated with botulinum toxin type A Allergan, administered intracutaneously at 4.0 U per cm2. Follow-up evaluations at 1 and 3 months, and then every 6 months, have been conducted to monitor for any adverse effects such as dry mouth, weakening of facial muscles, eyelid ptosis, facial paralysis, and short-term local reactions like pain, edema, erythema, and ecchymosis. The patient experienced a recurrence of symptoms 25 months after the initial treatment, confirmed by a repeat Minor test, and received another botulinum injection. A: The primary diagnosis is Frey's Syndrome post-parotidectomy. The patient's symptoms and positive Minor test confirm the diagnosis. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of facial sweating and flushing, but these are less likely given the history and test results. The prognosis is generally good with ongoing management, though recurrence is possible as evidenced by the patient's history. P: Continue semi-annual follow-ups to monitor the patient's condition and manage any recurrence of symptoms. Educate the patient on the signs of recurrence and advise them to report any new symptoms promptly. Consider repeating botulinum toxin injections as needed based on symptom recurrence and patient discomfort. Maintain vigilance for potential side effects from the treatment and manage them as necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you've developed some issues with your visual acuity in your right eye for about a month now. Can you describe the symptoms you've been experiencing? Patient: Yes, Doctor. My vision in my right eye has been getting worse, and it's been really blurry. Doctor: I see. We've conducted a dilated fundus examination (Fig. a) and FA (Fig. a-b) to get a better understanding of your condition. The results showed that your BCVA in the right eye is 20/200. We also found an infra-temporal RAM, with surrounding stellate-shaped exudates involving the fovea. Patient: Oh, that sounds concerning. Doctor: We also performed an OCT angiogram (Fig. b) which confirmed the RAMs and revealed a heliciform capillary mass in the superficial layer, segmented with an inner boundary at 3 μm beneath the internal limiting membrane and an outer boundary at 15 μm beneath the inner plexiform layer. Additionally, an OCT scan (Fig. c-d) showed SRD through the fovea. Patient: What does that mean for my vision? Doctor: The good news is that your vision improved to 20/70 after the first intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg of ranibizumab (Fig. e). There was also an increase in hard exudate around your fovea (Fig. f-h) and resolution of the SRD. Patient: That's a relief! Doctor: We decided to continue treatment with a therapy regimen used for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by administering a second intravitreal injection of ranibizumab. One month after the second injection, the hard exudate diminished (Fig. i-l) and your BCVA improved to 20/50. Patient: Wow, that's great news! Doctor: At the one-year follow-up, the final fundus examination (Fig. m) and FA (Fig. c-d) confirmed the complete absorption of the hemorrhage and the atrophy of the RAM. The OCT angiography showed that the capillary mass in the RAM disappeared (Fig. n). Patient: So, what does that mean for my eye now? Doctor: The macular anatomy maintained a normal appearance without SRD at the final visit (Fig. o-p). This means that the treatment has been successful and your eye should continue to improve. Patient: That's fantastic! Thank you, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any concerns or if your symptoms return, please don't hesitate to come back for a visit. Take care! [/INST] S: The patient reports progressively worsening blurry vision in the right eye over the past month. O: The patient's best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was initially 20/200 in the right eye, improving to 20/70 after the first intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg ranibizumab, and further to 20/50 following a second injection. Dilated fundus examination and fluorescein angiography (FA) identified an infra-temporal retinal arterial macroaneurysm (RAM) with stellate-shaped exudates affecting the fovea. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiogram and scan confirmed the presence of a heliciform capillary mass and subretinal fluid (SRD) through the fovea, which resolved after treatment. Follow-up examinations showed complete absorption of the hemorrhage, atrophy of the RAM, and normalization of macular anatomy. A: The primary diagnosis is a retinal arterial macroaneurysm with secondary complications including subretinal fluid and exudates affecting the fovea. The differential diagnosis could include other causes of exudative maculopathy, but findings are consistent with RAM. The prognosis is favorable given the significant improvement post-treatment. P: The treatment plan included two intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab, following a regimen used for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Continued monitoring of the patient's condition is recommended to ensure stability and further improvement of visual acuity. The patient is advised to return immediately if symptoms recur or new symptoms appear. Further education on the condition and its management was provided to ensure understanding and compliance with the treatment regimen. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're a 77-year-old man diagnosed with smoldering type ATLL and have been treated for specific skin lesions. You also have diabetes and have been taking oral hypoglycemic agents. Can you tell me about the progression of your skin condition? Patient: Yes, the erythema had progressed to plaques and tumors even after treatment with topical corticosteroids, narrow-band ultraviolet B, and oral etretinate. Doctor: I see. You also received electron radiation therapy followed by oral prednisolone and low-dose etoposide. How did that go? Patient: Not too well, the prednisolone and etoposide had to be stopped because I developed severe stomatitis. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Despite the increasing multiple plaques and tumors on your trunk and extremities, the progression from smoldering to acute subtype did not occur. The histopathological report shows a dense infiltration of small-to-medium-sized pleomorphic lymphoid cells in the dermis with prominent epidermotropism. The infiltrating cells were CD3+, CD4+, CD8−, CD79a−, and CCR4+. Foxp3+ cells were observed among atypical cells.  Patient: Hmm, what does that mean for me? Doctor: It means that although there is infiltration, the subtype of ATLL has not progressed to a more severe form. Now, let's discuss your blood tests. You don't seem to have any issues with hematological parameters and liver function: hemoglobin 13.3 g/L, White blood cell count (WBC) 4.6 × 10^9/L, neutrophils 3.8 × 10^9/L, lymphocytes 0.33 × 10^9/L, monocytes 0.38 × 10^9/L, eosinophils 0.04 × 10^9/L, basophils 0.02 × 10^9/L, platelet count 221 × 10^9/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 21 IU/L, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 21 IU/L.  Patient: That's a relief. But is there anything else I should be concerned about? Doctor: Your blood examination showed mild renal dysfunction: blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 22.7 mg/dL, creatinine 1.06 mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 52.3 mL/min/1.73 m2. We will need to monitor this closely. Patient: Okay, what's the next step in my treatment? Doctor: We intend to inject mogamulizumab 1.0 mg/kg, once weekly for 8 weeks. This will help in controlling the progression of your skin lesions. Patient: Alright, I understand. Is there anything else I should know or do? Doctor: Just make sure to continue monitoring your diabetes and report any new or worsening symptoms. We will also schedule regular checkups to assess your renal function and response to the mogamulizumab treatment. Patient: Got it. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact us. Take care! [/INST] S: The patient, a 77-year-old male with a history of smoldering type adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and diabetes, reports progression of his skin condition from erythema to plaques and tumors despite treatment with topical corticosteroids, narrow-band ultraviolet B, and oral etretinate. He experienced severe stomatitis leading to discontinuation of prednisolone and etoposide. He expresses concerns about his skin lesions and renal function. O: Physical examination and histopathology indicate multiple plaques and tumors on the trunk and extremities, with no progression to acute ATLL. Histopathological analysis shows infiltration of CD3+, CD4+, CD8−, CD79a−, and CCR4+ lymphoid cells. Blood tests reveal normal hematological parameters and liver function, with mild renal dysfunction noted (BUN 22.7 mg/dL, creatinine 1.06 mg/dL, eGFR 52.3 mL/min/1.73 m2). A: The primary diagnosis is smoldering type ATLL with skin involvement, complicated by mild renal dysfunction and diabetes. The patient's ATLL has not progressed to an acute subtype, but skin lesions continue to evolve, and renal function requires monitoring. P: Initiate treatment with mogamulizumab 1.0 mg/kg weekly for 8 weeks to control skin lesion progression. Continue monitoring of diabetes and renal function, with regular follow-ups to assess response to mogamulizumab and manage potential side effects. Educate the patient on symptom monitoring and maintaining communication with healthcare providers. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I heard you're an avid skier, and you were experiencing some left calf pain after a fall while skiing about two weeks ago. Can you describe the pain for me? Patient: Yeah, it was a sharp pain on the medial aspect of my left calf. My left ankle was forced into extreme dorsiflexion during the fall, and I felt immediate severe pain. I had to stop skiing that day. Doctor: Did you notice any swelling or bruising in the area after the fall? Patient: Yes, over the next few days, I noticed swelling in the medial calf and some bruising as well. Doctor: Were you able to ski again after the fall? How did the pain feel at that time? Patient: After about a week, I was able to ski again, but I felt pain aggravated by active plantar flexion. Doctor: Let's do a physical examination of your left leg. I see that your knee and ankle both appear normal and have normal strength and range of motion with no tenderness. Sensation and pulses are also normal. However, there is tenderness over the medial head of your gastrocnemius with a palpable, firm, four-centimeter ovoid mass. Pain is elicited during resisted plantar flexion. Your right leg seems completely normal. Patient: Hmm, that's odd. What could that mass be? Doctor: We performed radiographs of your lower leg, and they came back normal. But we did a POCUS in the ED focusing on the mass in the medial head of the gastrocnemius, and it revealed a swollen, heterogeneous, disorganized mass. Comparison views to the unaffected extremity further clarified the findings. Based on these results, we have diagnosed a muscle tear in the medial head of your gastrocnemius. Patient: Oh, that's not good. What can I do to help it heal? Doctor: We'll instruct you on exercises for strengthening and range of motion of the calf and ankle, specifically eccentric exercises that you should complete after an initial rest period of two weeks. Patient: Okay, I'll make sure to follow those exercises. How long will it take for my symptoms to improve? Doctor: On follow-up two months after your initial visit, we expect your symptoms to have nearly completely resolved. You should be able to do activities like mountain biking several times per week with only minimal pain after a long ride. The mass in the calf should resolve as well, and you shouldn't have any concerns about your leg for the upcoming ski season. Patient: That's great to hear! Thank you so much for your help, Doctor. I'll make sure to follow your instructions and hope for a smooth recovery. [/INST] S: Patient reports experiencing sharp pain in the medial aspect of the left calf following a skiing accident two weeks ago, where the left ankle was forced into extreme dorsiflexion. The patient observed swelling and bruising in the medial calf in the days following the incident. Pain was aggravated by active plantar flexion when attempting to ski one week post-injury. O: Physical examination revealed normal appearance, strength, and range of motion in the knee and ankle with no tenderness, normal sensation, and pulses. However, there is tenderness over the medial head of the gastrocnemius with a palpable, firm, four-centimeter ovoid mass, and pain during resisted plantar flexion. Radiographs of the lower leg were normal. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) showed a swollen, heterogeneous, disorganized mass in the medial head of the gastrocnemius, consistent with a muscle tear. A: The primary diagnosis is a muscle tear in the medial head of the gastrocnemius. The prognosis is good with appropriate management, expecting nearly complete resolution of symptoms and the mass within two months. P: The management plan includes an initial rest period of two weeks followed by specific exercises for strengthening and range of motion of the calf and ankle, focusing on eccentric exercises. Follow-up is scheduled for two months post-initial visit to assess recovery progress and ensure readiness for activities such as mountain biking and the upcoming ski season. Compliance with the exercise regimen is crucial for recovery. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I have been feeling weak and having generalized abdominal pain, nausea, and intractable vomiting for a week. I've also had multiple episodes of loose, non-bloody bowel movements. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any fevers, chills, hematochezia, melena, voiding difficulty, dysuria, hematuria, or flank pain? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those. Doctor: Do you have any past medical history we should be aware of, or any family history of gastrointestinal or renal disease? Patient: I don't have any past medical history, and I'm not aware of any family history of gastrointestinal or renal disease. But to be honest, I haven't seen a doctor in the past 18 years. Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Let's proceed with a physical examination. Your temperature is 36.8°C, heart rate 69 bpm, respiratory rate 16 br/min, blood pressure 147/102 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. You appear diaphoretic and in moderate distress. Your abdomen is soft, diffusely tender, with no distension, guarding, or rigidity. Your bowel sounds are normoactive, and both your costovertebral angle tenderness and Murphy sign are negative. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: We've also completed some laboratory tests. Your white blood cell count is 6100 K/mcl, hemoglobin 5.9 g/dL, hematocrit 18%, and platelet count 240,000 K/mcl. The basic metabolic panel shows sodium of 130 mmol/L, potassium 4.7 mmol/L, chloride 95 mmol/L, CO2 24 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) >150 mg/dL, creatinine 26.9 mg/dL, anion gap 21, glucose 87 mg/dL, and serum calcium 6.5 mg/dL. Your liver function studies and lipase are within normal limits. The fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is negative. Patient: Oh, that's quite a lot of numbers. Doctor: Yes, but don't worry. I'll explain what they mean. Your anemia workup showed normal iron levels, low total iron binding capacity (TIBC), high ferritin, normal B12, and low reticulocyte count. Your arterial blood gas results showed pH 7.35 and pCO2 32 mmHg. Patient: So, what does all of this mean, Doctor? Doctor: Based on your symptoms and lab results, there could be several potential causes for your condition. We'll need to conduct further tests and possibly consult a specialist to determine the exact cause and develop a treatment plan. Patient: Alright, I understand. What are the next steps? Doctor: We'll schedule an appointment for you to see a specialist and perform additional tests. In the meantime, please monitor your symptoms and contact us or visit the emergency department if they worsen or if you develop any new symptoms. Patient: Okay, thank you, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll be in touch to schedule your follow-up appointment. Take care. [/INST] S: Patient reports a week of generalized abdominal pain, nausea, intractable vomiting, and multiple episodes of loose, non-bloody bowel movements. Denies fevers, chills, hematochezia, melena, voiding difficulty, dysuria, hematuria, or flank pain. No known past medical or family history of gastrointestinal or renal disease.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I hope you're feeling comfortable. We have been discussing your case in our recent study, in which you provided informed consent to participate. Patient: Yes, I remember signing up for that. Doctor: So, the patient under discussion today is a 30-year-old male weight lifter with hyper-acute onset chest and back pain. Can you describe the pain you experienced? Patient: Yeah, it was a sudden, severe pain in my chest and back. Doctor: Okay. Upon initial evaluation, we didn't find any manifestation of phenotypic findings like iris flocculi, livedo reticularis, or aortic valve abnormalities that might hint towards connective tissue disorders or aortic pathology. Patient: Hmm, that's good to know. Doctor: Based on echocardiography and chest CT findings, we diagnosed you with a Type A Aortic Dissection with severe aortic valve regurgitation. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it is. We immediately intubated you and transferred you to the American Medical Center (AMC) in Nicosia, Cyprus, where you had emergency aortic surgery and a Bentall procedure. No angiography was performed due to the fact that you had an aortic dissection and it was an emergency situation. Patient: I remember being rushed to the hospital. Doctor: Intraoperative findings showed a 70 mm diameter aortic root aneurysm with dissection extending from the sinotubular junction to the aortic root. The aortic annulus was extensively dilated, and the aortic dissection extended down the origin of the left main coronary artery involving also the aortic valve commissures that resulted in severe aortic valve regurgitation. There was no evidence of involvement of the distal ascending aorta and the aortic arch. Patient: That's a lot to take in. Doctor: Yes, it is. But we also evaluated your family members and found that several of them had ascending aortic aneurysms. Your father, a 60-year-old male, had an asymptomatic aortic root and ascending aortic aneurysm of 52 mm that also required aortic valve, aortic root, and ascending aortic replacement (Bentall procedure). We confirmed the presence and dimensions of the aneurysm through CT chest coronary angiography, and coronary angiography did not show any coronary artery disease. Patient: Oh, I didn't know that about my dad. Doctor: Your mother, a 56-year-old female, was also screened with echocardiography that showed ascending aortic dilatation, 42 mm in diameter. Patient: How about my siblings? Doctor: Subsequent screening of your two sisters, ages 22 and 34 respectively, did not show any abnormalities. Patient: That's a relief. Doctor: We will continue to monitor your family members and recommend regular follow-ups for you as well. This could be a genetic predisposition, so it's important to stay vigilant about your health. Patient: I understand. Thank you for all the information, doctor. I'll make sure to follow up on my health. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help. [/INST] S: The patient is a 30-year-old male weight lifter who presented with hyper-acute onset of severe chest and back pain. He has a family history of aortic aneurysms, with his father having undergone a Bentall procedure for an aortic root and ascending aortic aneurysm, and his mother showing ascending aortic dilatation. O: Physical examination did not reveal any signs of connective tissue disorders or aortic pathology. Echocardiography and chest CT confirmed a Type A Aortic Dissection with severe aortic valve regurgitation. Intraoperative findings included a 70 mm diameter aortic root aneurysm, dissection extending from the sinotubular junction to the aortic root, and severe aortic valve regurgitation due to involvement of the aortic valve commissures. The patient underwent emergency aortic surgery and a Bentall procedure at AMC, Nicosia, Cyprus. A: The primary diagnosis is Type A Aortic Dissection with severe aortic valve regurgitation. The patient's family history and intraoperative findings suggest a possible genetic predisposition to aortic aneurysms and dissections. P: The patient will require regular follow-up and monitoring for any further cardiovascular complications. Genetic counseling and screening for familial aortic aneurysm syndromes may be considered to assess risk in other family members. The patient and his family members should be educated about signs and symptoms of aortic dissection and the importance of immediate medical attention. Regular echocardiography and CT scans are recommended to monitor the condition. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that you are a 69-year-old Japanese woman who has never smoked, is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: You were diagnosed with clinical stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with pleural and bone metastasis. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, unfortunately. Doctor: I see that you have no history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, or any colonic diseases like constipation. Is that still accurate? Patient: Yes, that's still accurate. Doctor: At the initial diagnosis, no EGFR gene mutation was detected in malignant pleural effusion by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). You were started with a combination regimen of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab as the first-line treatment. Patient: Yeah, I remember that. Doctor: After that, you received pemetrexed, erlotinib, and docetaxel as second-, third-, and fourth-line treatments respectively. Each regimen was changed because of disease progression. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: It seems that lung cancer progressed with increased pleural effusion after one cycle with gemcitabine as your fifth-line treatment. So, EGFR gene mutation was studied in pleural effusion using PCR fragment analysis and PCR clamp method. Two EGFR gene mutations were detected: a deletion in exon 19 and a T790 M point mutation in exon 20.  Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: Based on the genetic results, afatinib was started as the sixth-line treatment, as recommended in the LUX-Lung-4 study. Osimertinib was not an option because it was not yet approved at that time. The PFS of afatinib was 4.0 months. Treatment with afatinib continued for 15.3 months (458 days) until osimertinib was approved. Patient: Okay, so that's why I took afatinib for so long. Doctor: Yes, that's correct. Osimertinib (80 mg/day) was started as the seventh-line treatment when you were 74 years old. At that time, your body mass index was 16.2 kg/cm2 and you had a performance status of 1. Patient: Yes, I remember starting osimertinib. Doctor: The adverse events you experienced, cutaneous pruritus and stomatitis, were graded with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, ver 4.0) as grade 1. How are you feeling now? Patient: The itching and mouth sores are not too bad now. Doctor: That's good to hear. Please continue to monitor your symptoms and report any changes. We will continue to follow up with you and adjust the treatment as necessary. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care. [/INST] S: The patient is a 69-year-old Japanese woman, a non-smoker, diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with pleural and bone metastasis. She reports no history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, or colonic diseases. She has undergone multiple lines of chemotherapy and targeted therapy due to disease progression, currently on osimertinib with mild adverse effects of cutaneous pruritus and stomatitis. O: Initial diagnostic tests showed no EGFR gene mutation, but subsequent testing revealed two mutations (deletion in exon 19 and T790M point mutation in exon 20). Current treatment is osimertinib 80 mg/day, started when the patient was 74 years old. Her body mass index is 16.2 kg/cm2, and her performance status is 1. Adverse events are graded as CTCAE version 4.0 grade 1. A: Primary diagnosis is stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with pleural and bone metastasis. The presence of EGFR mutations has guided the use of targeted therapies. The patient's current treatment regimen is appropriate given the genetic profile and previous treatment responses. The prognosis is guarded due to the advanced stage of cancer and the history of multiple lines of treatment. P: Continue current treatment with osimertinib 80 mg/day. Monitor for efficacy and adverse effects, particularly the management of cutaneous pruritus and stomatitis. Regular follow-ups to assess treatment response and adjust therapy as needed. Encourage the patient to report any new symptoms or changes in her condition. Provide supportive care and symptom management to improve quality of life. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented with sudden severe right shoulder and flank pain, as well as numbness in your right hand. Can you tell me if you had any subjective symptoms prior to today? Patient: No, I didn't have any symptoms before today. Doctor: Alright. I see from your history that you have hypertension, which is managed with medication. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: I understand that you called an ambulance 3 hours after the onset of your symptoms and were able to get in unassisted. You were then transported to a nearby hospital. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: It seems that you developed hemoptysis, hypoxemia, severe forced breathing, and tachypnea at the hospital. You were intubated and transferred to our emergency department by air ambulance helicopter 6 hours after the onset of symptoms. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: During your examination here, a coarse crackle with right lateral dominance was audible. We've also been suctioning a small volume of blood through your tracheal tube, although bronchoscopic examination did not reveal any source of bleeding. Your blood pressure was 132/87 mmHg, pulse 109 beats per minute, and body temperature 36.7 °C. You are currently under sedation and mechanically ventilated with spontaneous breathing at a rate of 14 breaths per minute. We didn't observe any skin eruptions or lesions. Does that all sound correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: We performed a chest computed tomography (CT) examination and saw infiltration predominant in the right upper lobe, spreading to the right middle and lower lobe, and left hilar area. We've also collected peripheral blood for laboratory examination. Patient: Okay. Doctor: The arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.174, with a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 62.4 mmHg, a partial pressure of oxygen of 94.3 mmHg, and a base deficit of -7.4, under the condition of end-expiratory pressure at 10 cm H2O and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.5. This indicates acute respiratory failure. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: Other laboratory data, including blood cell count, coagulation, and biochemistry, were normal, except for a slight elevation in your serum creatinine level. We will continue to monitor your condition closely. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We will do our best to provide the appropriate care for your condition. Please let us know if you experience any changes in your symptoms or if you have any questions. Patient: I will, thank you.

O: Physical examination revealed coarse crackles with right lateral dominance and a small volume of blood suctioned through the tracheal tube, though bronchoscopy showed no source of bleeding. Vital signs included blood pressure at 132/87 mmHg, pulse at 109 bpm, and temperature at 36.7 °C. Chest CT showed infiltration in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes, and left hilar area. Arterial blood gas analysis indicated acute respiratory failure with a pH of 7.174, pCO2 of 62.4 mmHg, pO2 of 94.3 mmHg, and a base deficit of -7.4. Other labs were normal except for slightly elevated serum creatinine. A: The primary diagnosis is acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to a pulmonary process, evidenced by imaging and exacerbated by the patient's hypertension. Differential diagnoses could include pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, or other pulmonary pathology. P: Continue mechanical ventilation and sedation while closely monitoring respiratory and renal function. Adjust medications as necessary based on ongoing lab and clinical findings. Consult pulmonology for further evaluation of the pulmonary infiltrates and potential underlying causes. Educate patient and family about the condition, treatment plan, and importance of reporting any new symptoms promptly. Ensure follow-up after stabilization for reassessment and management of hypertension and renal function. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that your 9-month-old unvaccinated Amish female baby is here today. Can you tell me about her past medical history? Parent: She doesn't have any significant past medical history. Doctor: What brings her to the emergency department today? Parent: She's been having a fever, cough, and increased work of breathing recently. Doctor: Based on her examination, she appears to be quite ill with significant respiratory distress and bilateral wheezing. We tried a nebulized albuterol treatment, but there was no clinical improvement. She required intubation secondary to persistent tachypnea. Her chest X-ray showed bilateral infra-hilar streaky opacities, which got worse on imaging immediately following intubation. Parent: What does that mean? Doctor: It means that her lungs are showing signs of inflammation and possible infection. We've done a complete blood count, which was unremarkable. She received a dose of ceftriaxone and was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, where she was continued on piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Parent: I remember she was hospitalized 21 days ago for hypoxic respiratory failure due to left lower lobe pneumonia after an unwitnessed aspiration while being bottle-fed. Doctor: Yes, during her prior hospitalization, her chest X-ray showed a right peri-hilar opacity, and her tracheal aspirate culture was positive for both Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. She received bronchodilator therapy and a 7-day course of ceftriaxone, which led to clinical improvement. Parent: But after she was discharged, we noticed minimal improvement on scheduled albuterol. She still had episodes of increased work of breathing, persistent coughing, and wheezing. Then she developed a fever and her respiratory symptoms got worse, so we brought her here. Doctor: Despite aggressive bronchodilator therapy and airway clearance, she continues to show clinical signs of obstructive airway disease. Her tracheal aspirate culture is positive for H. influenzae, and her respiratory viral panel detected both rhinovirus and enterovirus. We discontinued Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) 48 hours after a repeat tracheal culture showed no growth. Parent: What about her lung collapse? We don't think she had any choking episodes or foreign body aspiration. Doctor: Her initial chest X-ray did show acute left-sided lung collapse, but without any choking episodes or foreign body aspiration, it could be due to the severe inflammation and infection. We will continue to monitor her closely and adjust her treatment as needed. Parent: Thank you, Doctor. We appreciate your help and care for our baby. [/INST] S: The patient, a 9-month-old unvaccinated Amish female, presents with fever, cough, and increased work of breathing. She has a history of hypoxic respiratory failure due to left lower lobe pneumonia 21 days ago, following an unwitnessed aspiration while being bottle-fed. Post-discharge, she continued to experience increased work of breathing, persistent coughing, and wheezing, with minimal improvement on scheduled albuterol. Her symptoms worsened recently, prompting the current visit. O: On examination, the patient appeared significantly ill with respiratory distress and bilateral wheezing. Initial management with nebulized albuterol showed no clinical improvement, leading to intubation due to persistent tachypnea. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral infra-hilar streaky opacities, which worsened post-intubation. Complete blood count was unremarkable. Tracheal aspirate culture positive for Haemophilus influenzae; respiratory viral panel detected rhinovirus and enterovirus. Initial chest X-ray also showed acute left-sided lung collapse. She was administered ceftriaxone and admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for further management with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), which was discontinued after 48 hours following a repeat tracheal culture showing no growth. A: The primary diagnosis is severe obstructive airway disease complicated by acute respiratory distress and infection, likely exacerbated by a recent history of pneumonia and aspiration. Differential diagnoses include viral bronchiolitis and bacterial superinfection. The presence of bilateral infra-hilar opacities and acute lung collapse suggests significant pulmonary inflammation and possible ongoing infection. P: Continue intensive monitoring in the pediatric intensive care unit. Maintain airway support and adjust ventilatory settings as needed. Resume aggressive bronchodilator therapy and airway clearance techniques. Antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone was initiated and switched to piperacillin/tazobactam, now discontinued; consider reinitiating if signs of bacterial infection persist or worsen. Regularly reassess the need for further imaging or laboratory studies to monitor the progression or resolution of pulmonary changes. Educate parents about the importance of monitoring respiratory symptoms and ensuring strict adherence to scheduled treatments and follow-up appointments. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, I'm Dr. Smith. What brings you to the emergency room today? Patient: Hi, doc. I've been having some intermittent nausea and vomiting for the past two weeks. Just now, I threw up a plastic glove. Doctor: Oh, that's concerning. Have you had any other symptoms or issues recently? Patient: Hmm, not really. Just the nausea and vomiting. Doctor: Alright. Since the foreign body came out, we'll need to do a computed tomography (CT) scan of your abdomen to check for any possible issues, such as a gastric mass.  Patient: Okay, sure. (After the CT scan) Doctor: The CT scan shows a non-enhancing mixed density intraluminal gastric mass. We'll need to perform an endoscopy to confirm the diagnosis and attempt to retrieve any foreign bodies that may still be inside. Patient: Oh, alright. Please do what you need to do. (After the endoscopy) Doctor: The endoscopy wasn't successful in removing the foreign bodies. We'll need to take you to the operating room for surgery to remove them properly. Patient: I understand. I've had multiple abdominal surgeries before, by the way. Doctor: Thank you for letting me know. In that case, we'll perform an upper midline incision, which should be suitable given your surgical history. We'll then perform a gastrotomy and remove any foreign body bezoars. Patient: Okay, I trust you, doc. (After the surgery) Doctor: The surgery went well, and we successfully removed the foreign body bezoars. You should start feeling better soon.  Patient: Thanks, doc. I'm already feeling a bit better. Doctor: That's great to hear. We'll keep an eye on your progress, and once you're well enough, we'll have you discharged from the hospital. Patient: Thank you, Dr. Smith, for all your help. [/INST] S: The patient, a male with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries, presented to the emergency room with intermittent nausea and vomiting over the past two weeks. He reported an acute episode of vomiting up a plastic glove today. O: Initial physical examination was unremarkable. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a non-enhancing mixed density intraluminal gastric mass. An attempt to remove the foreign bodies via endoscopy was unsuccessful. Subsequent surgical intervention involved an upper midline incision and gastrotomy, during which foreign body bezoars were successfully removed. A: The primary diagnosis is gastric foreign body bezoars. Differential diagnoses prior to imaging and surgery included gastric mass or obstruction. The patient's history of multiple abdominal surgeries was considered in choosing the surgical approach. P: Post-operatively, the patient will be monitored in the hospital until stable for discharge. The plan includes pain management, hydration, and gradual advancement of diet as tolerated. Patient education will focus on avoiding ingestion of non-food items and recognizing signs of gastrointestinal distress. Follow-up will include a post-discharge visit to assess recovery and ensure no further complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I've been told that you were referred to our hospital with a six-year history of bilateral amblyopia. Can you tell me more about your visual disorder? Patient: Yeah, I've had trouble with my vision since I was a preschooler. I've been to many ophthalmologists and had complete ophthalmological examinations and evaluations at several medical institutions, but they couldn't determine the cause of my visual disturbance. Doctor: I see. So you were tentatively diagnosed with amblyopia or visual disturbances of psychogenic origin. Have you been examined regularly since your first evaluation? Patient: Yes, I've been examined every 2 to 3 months. Doctor: And were you ever diagnosed with any iris-related diseases or iris nodules? Patient: No, I've never been diagnosed with any iris-related diseases. Doctor: Alright. At your first examination here, your best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/40 in both your right and left eyes. Your pupils were of equal size, and there was no afferent pupillary defect. Our slit-lamp examination revealed numerous small iris nodules bilaterally. Extraocular movements were full without nystagmus. The intraocular pressure was 12 mmHg in your right eye and 11 mmHg in your left eye. The ophthalmoscopic findings of your retina were within the normal limits, and optical coherence tomography showed that the macula appeared normal in both eyes. Your visual field and color vision tests were also within normal limits. Patient: Oh, okay. So what does that mean for my vision? Doctor: Based on our examination, we prescribed spectacle correction of +0.25 -0.25 x130 in your right eye and +0.25 -0.25 x160 in your left eye to reduce the risk of amblyopia. After 3 years of treatment, your BCVA improved to 20/25 in your right eye and 20/20 in your left eye. Patient: That's great! So, did I have any complications during the treatment? Doctor: No, during the treatment of amblyopia, neuronal complications such as mental disease, neuropathy, and neurofibromatosis were not observed. Your treatment has been successful, and your vision has improved significantly. Patient: Oh, that's a relief! What should I do for follow-up care? Doctor: Continue with your prescribed spectacles and maintain regular check-ups with your ophthalmologist. If you notice any changes in your vision, don't hesitate to reach out to your doctor. Patient: Thank you so much, Doctor. I appreciate all your help! Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to contact us. Take care, and have a great day! [/INST] S: The patient, with a six-year history of bilateral amblyopia, reported persistent visual disturbances since preschool despite multiple ophthalmological evaluations. The patient has been regularly examined every 2 to 3 months without any diagnosis of iris-related diseases. O: Initial examination at our facility showed best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination revealed small iris nodules bilaterally. Extraocular movements were full, and intraocular pressure was 12 mmHg in the right eye and 11 mmHg in the left eye. Ophthalmoscopic and optical coherence tomography findings were normal. Visual field and color vision tests were within normal limits. After 3 years of spectacle correction treatment (+0.25 -0.25 x130 right eye, +0.25 -0.25 x160 left eye), BCVA improved to 20/25 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. A: The patient was diagnosed with bilateral amblyopia, which has shown significant improvement with spectacle correction over three years. No complications such as mental disease, neuropathy, or neurofibromatosis were observed during treatment. P: The patient is advised to continue using the prescribed spectacles and maintain regular ophthalmological check-ups. The patient should monitor for any changes in vision and report immediately to the ophthalmologist. Further follow-up is essential to ensure continued management and to address any new symptoms promptly. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I was in a motor vehicle accident and was brought to the hospital. Doctor: I see. How were you feeling when you arrived at the hospital? Patient: I felt really weak and was hypotensive. Doctor: Based on your condition, we performed an exploratory laparotomy, splenectomy, embolization of hepatic vessels, and a right-sided partial hepatectomy due to a grade V liver laceration. After the surgery, you developed bilious drainage from an intra-abdominal drain. We suspected a bile leak and did an ERCP, which confirmed the leak from the right biliary system. We then placed a 10 Fr x 5 cm plastic biliary stent. Patient: Yeah, I remember that. But I continued to have issues after the stent placement. Doctor: Yes, you had high output of amylase-rich fluid from a separate intra-abdominal drain, which was suspicious for a pancreatic duct leak. We performed a repeat ERCP with pancreatogram and found a leak from the pancreatic tail. We placed a 5 Fr x 13 cm pancreatic duct stent and upsized your biliary stent to a 10 mm x 4 cm covered self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) due to the persistent biliary leak. Patient: After a month, I became really sick again. Doctor: That's correct. You developed septic symptoms and a CT scan of your abdomen revealed a peri-pancreatic abscess. We tried percutaneous drainage of the abscess, but there was minimal drainage and no clinical improvement. Patient: And then I had another procedure, right? Doctor: Yes, we performed an EUS and found a 55 mm, oval, heterogeneous peri-pancreatic fluid collection with hyperechoic material, consistent with solid debris. We placed a 10mm x 10mm LAMS from your stomach into the fluid collection, which allowed for drainage of pus and debris. Patient: I remember feeling much better after that. Doctor: Indeed, you showed significant improvement and we discharged you home. A follow-up CT scan of your abdomen 4 weeks later showed an interval decrease in the size of the previous small fluid collection. Patient: And then the LAMS was removed? Doctor: Yes, we uneventfully removed the LAMS endoscopically 8 weeks after the initial placement. You've made excellent progress in your recovery. Please continue to monitor your symptoms and follow up with your primary care physician for any concerns. [/INST] S: The patient, a victim of a motor vehicle accident, reported initial symptoms of weakness and hypotension upon hospital arrival. Post-surgical complications included bilious drainage from an intra-abdominal drain and high output of amylase-rich fluid from another drain, indicating a bile leak and a pancreatic duct leak, respectively. The patient also experienced septic symptoms one month post-surgery. O: Initial treatments included exploratory laparotomy, splenectomy, embolization of hepatic vessels, and right-sided partial hepatectomy for a grade V liver laceration. ERCP confirmed a bile leak from the right biliary system, leading to the placement of a 10 Fr x 5 cm plastic biliary stent, later upgraded to a 10 mm x 4 cm covered SEMS. A pancreatic duct leak from the tail was managed with a 5 Fr x 13 cm pancreatic duct stent. A CT scan revealed a peri-pancreatic abscess, managed with percutaneous drainage and EUS-guided placement of a 10mm x 10mm LAMS for drainage. Follow-up CT showed decreased size of the fluid collection, and the LAMS was removed 8 weeks post-placement. A: The primary diagnosis is trauma from a motor vehicle accident with subsequent complications including a grade V liver laceration, bile leak, pancreatic duct leak, and peri-pancreatic abscess. The patient's recovery trajectory has been complicated but is currently favorable following multiple interventions. P: The patient was discharged with instructions to monitor symptoms and follow up with their primary care physician. Continued observation for any signs of infection or recurrence of symptoms is essential. The patient should maintain a balanced diet, avoid strenuous activities that could impact the abdominal region, and attend regular follow-up appointments to monitor recovery progress and manage any arising complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see you were referred to the Department of Endodontics for an evaluation of your mandibular first molar. Can you tell me a bit about your dental history? Patient: Hi, yes. About 6 months ago, I had a root canal treatment on tooth #36, and they put a stainless steel crown on it afterward. Doctor: Thank you for the information. During the clinical examination, we found that the tooth had a painful response to percussion and was nonresponsive to the pulp vitality test. We also did some periodontal probing, which was within normal limits. Based on a radiographic examination, we could see the previous endodontic treatment, periradicular radiolucency, and open apices in the mesial root. The clinical diagnosis is a previously endodontically treated tooth with symptomatic apical periodontitis. We will need to perform endodontic retreatment in conjunction with an apexification technique. Patient: Oh, I see. What will that involve? Doctor: First, we will administer local anesthesia with 2% mepivacaine (Scandonest; Septodont) to numb the area. Then we will isolate the tooth with a rubber dam and remove the stainless steel crown. We will create an access cavity under a dental microscope to remove the root canal filling from all the canals. Patient: Okay, and then what? Doctor: After removing the root canal filling with Hedstrom and K3XF files (SybronEndo, Orange, CA), we will locate any previously untreated MMC. We will establish the working length based on radiographs and K-files (SybronEndo). The instrumentation and irrigation of the canals will be performed with K3XF files (SybronEndo) and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCL). Calcium hydroxide will be used as an intracanal medicament. Patient: Alright, and what happens after that? Doctor: You will have a second appointment in 6 weeks. By that time, you should be asymptomatic. During the second appointment, we will irrigate the canals with 2.5% NaOCL and 17% EDTA. Then, we will use MTA (Angelus, Londrina) to complete the apexification process. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining the procedure to me. I hope this retreatment will resolve the issue. Doctor: You're welcome. The endodontic retreatment and apexification technique should help alleviate your symptoms and improve your dental health. Make sure to follow up with us after the treatment and maintain good oral hygiene. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to reach out. Patient: I will. Thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient reports having undergone a root canal treatment on tooth #36 approximately 6 months ago, followed by placement of a stainless steel crown. The patient was referred for evaluation due to ongoing issues with the same tooth. O: Clinical examination revealed a painful response to percussion and non-responsiveness to pulp vitality tests on tooth #36. Periodontal probing was within normal limits. Radiographic examination showed periradicular radiolucency and open apices in the mesial root of the previously treated tooth. Local anesthesia to be used is 2% mepivacaine. The root canal filling removal will involve Hedstrom and K3XF files, with instrumentation and irrigation using K3XF files and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite. Calcium hydroxide will be used as an intracanal medicament. A: The diagnosis is symptomatic apical periodontitis in a previously endodontically treated tooth (#36). The open apices and periradicular radiolucency suggest failed initial treatment and possible ongoing infection. P: Plan to perform endodontic retreatment along with an apexification technique. The retreatment will involve removing the existing stainless steel crown, creating an access cavity, and removing old root canal fillings. Use of intracanal medicament (calcium hydroxide) followed by a second appointment in 6 weeks for final irrigation with NaOCL and EDTA, and completion of apexification using MTA. Emphasized the importance of follow-up care and maintaining oral hygiene. Patient education on the procedure and reassurance provided. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you were admitted into our center with a history of bleeding gums for 6 months and a high fever for 18 days. Can you tell me about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, my gums have been bleeding easily and I've had this high fever that won't go away. Doctor: I see. During your physical examination, we were able to palpate your spleen below the costal margins, but there was no surperficial lymphadenopathy. We conducted a complete blood count and found that your white blood cell count was 64.32 × 109/L with 2% myeloblasts, hemoglobin level was 94 g/L, and the platelet count was 20 × 109/L.  Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: We also took a bone marrow aspirate for further testing. While waiting for the results, you had another fever and your hemogram gradually declined. We found elevated levels of triglycerides (2.18 mmol/L), alanine aminotransferase (67 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (84 IU/L), lactate dehydrogenase (3537 IU/L), serum ferritin (81066 ng/mL), and soluble CD25 (1010 U/mL). Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Additionally, we detected reduced natural killer cell activity (12.5%) and a low fibrinogen level (0.5 g/L). Taking all the clinical and laboratory findings into account, we diagnosed you with HLH according to the 2004 diagnostic guidelines for HLH. Patient: I see. What's the treatment for that? Doctor: We started you on treatment immediately with dexamethasone and etoposide based on the HLH-2004 regimen. The dexamethasone dose will be gradually reduced as well.  Patient: Alright. Doctor: Your bone marrow aspirate showed a hypercellular marrow with 1% myeloblasts. Flow cytometry (FCM) studies indicated that 1.9% of nucleated cells were positive for CD34, HLA-DR, CD13, CD33, CD56, CD117, and negative for CD5, CD7, CD16, CD19. This indicates an abnormal myeloid blast origin. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: Chromosomal analysis of your bone marrow cells showed an abnormal karyotype - 46, XX, t(8;21;22)(q22;q22;q11.2). Moreover, the RUNX1–RUNX1T1 fusion transcripts were detected in your sample. Patient: So, what does all this mean for me? Doctor: It means that we have identified the cause of your symptoms and have started you on an appropriate treatment plan. We will closely monitor your progress and adjust the treatment as needed. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate all the help. [/INST] S: The patient reports a history of bleeding gums for 6 months and a persistent high fever for 18 days. The patient describes the gums as bleeding easily and the fever as unrelenting. O: Physical examination revealed splenomegaly with the spleen palpable below the costal margins, but no superficial lymphadenopathy was noted. Laboratory findings include a significantly elevated white blood cell count at 64.32 × 10^9/L, with 2% myeloblasts, low hemoglobin at 94 g/L, and critically low platelet count at 20 × 10^9/L. Additional tests showed high triglycerides at 2.18 mmol/L, elevated liver enzymes (ALT 67 IU/L, AST 84 IU/L), extremely high lactate dehydrogenase at 3537 IU/L, serum ferritin at 81066 ng/mL, and soluble CD25 at 1010 U/mL. Natural killer cell activity was reduced at 12.5%, and fibrinogen was dangerously low at 0.5 g/L. Bone marrow aspirate indicated hypercellular marrow with 1% myeloblasts. Flow cytometry showed abnormal myeloid blast origin, and chromosomal analysis revealed an abnormal karyotype - 46, XX, t(8;21;22)(q22;q22;q11.2) with RUNX1–RUNX1T1 fusion transcripts. A: The patient is diagnosed with Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) based on clinical and laboratory findings aligning with the 2004 HLH diagnostic guidelines. The presence of abnormal myeloid blasts and specific chromosomal abnormalities suggests a concurrent hematological malignancy, likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;21;22) translocation. P: Initiated treatment with dexamethasone and etoposide as per the HLH-2004 treatment protocol. The plan includes close monitoring of hematological parameters and adjustment of therapy based on response and side effects. Further genetic and molecular studies will guide the management of the underlying hematological condition. Patient education on the nature of the disease, treatment expectations, and potential complications is crucial. Regular follow-ups and supportive care will be necessary to manage symptoms and treatment side effects. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I came here because I've been having this painless progressive swelling in the left side of my abdomen for the last 8 years. It wasn't bothering me much, but for the last 2 years, it has increased and causes discomfort. Doctor: I see. Apart from this discomfort, have you experienced any bladder or bowel issues or any systemic symptoms like fever, weight loss, or loss of appetite? Patient: No, I haven't experienced any of those symptoms. Doctor: How about any history of anorexia, paroxysmal hypertension, tachycardia, headache, perspiration, or palpitations? Patient: No, I don't have any history of those conditions. Doctor: Alright. Let's proceed with an abdominal examination. *After examining the patient* I found a large, firm swelling of size around 20 × 15 cm in the left upper and lower quadrant of your abdomen. It's non-tender and dull on percussion. The scrotum and testis appear normal, and there's no pedal edema or lymphadenopathy. Based on this, I'm making a provisional clinical diagnosis of a pseudo-pancreatic cyst. Patient: Hmm, okay. What's the next step? Doctor: We'll need to run some blood and laboratory tests to gather more information. *After receiving the test results* Your blood and laboratory investigations are within normal limits. Patient: That's good to hear. What about the swelling? Doctor: We performed a contrast-enhanced computed tomography, which revealed a thin-walled hypodense cystic mass of size 25.7 × 15 × 14.3 cm in the left side of your abdomen. This lesion is compressing the body and tail of the pancreas and displacing the head of the pancreas, stomach, first and second parts of the duodenum, small bowel loops, abdominal aorta, and superior mesenteric vessels to the right side. It's also compressing the left ureter, causing mild hydro-ureteronephrosis. Patient: Oh, that sounds concerning. What do we do now? Doctor: We'll need to consult with a specialist to discuss treatment options for the cyst. In the meantime, it's important to monitor your symptoms and report any changes in your condition. Patient: Alright, thank you for your help, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. We'll be here to support you throughout the process. [/INST] S: The patient reports a painless progressive swelling in the left side of the abdomen that has been present for 8 years and has increased in size over the last 2 years, causing discomfort. The patient denies any bladder or bowel issues, systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or loss of appetite, and has no history of anorexia, paroxysmal hypertension, tachycardia, headache, perspiration, or palpitations. O: Physical examination revealed a large, firm, non-tender swelling measuring approximately 20 × 15 cm in the left upper and lower quadrant of the abdomen, dull on percussion. The scrotum, testis, and absence of pedal edema and lymphadenopathy were noted as normal. Blood and laboratory tests are within normal limits. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a thin-walled hypodense cystic mass measuring 25.7 × 15 × 14.3 cm in the left abdomen, compressing and displacing nearby organs and causing mild hydro-ureteronephrosis. A: The primary diagnosis is a pseudo-pancreatic cyst based on the clinical and imaging findings. The differential diagnosis would consider other cystic abdominal masses, but the imaging characteristics and location are suggestive of a pseudo-pancreatic cyst. The prognosis depends on the effective management of the cyst and monitoring for potential complications such as increased compression of abdominal organs. P: The management plan includes referral to a specialist for further evaluation and discussion of treatment options, which may include surgical intervention. The patient is advised to monitor and report any new symptoms or changes in the current condition. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess the progression of the cyst and response to treatment. Compliance with follow-up and treatment recommendations is crucial for effective management. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing some swelling in my lower extremities for the past three days. Doctor: I see. Let me check your medical history. You're a 45-year-old Hispanic male with end-stage renal disease of unknown etiology, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Your HLA typing is A 2,- B 7, 35, Cw 4, 7, DR 4,- DQ 8,-, and you underwent a living related kidney transplant two years ago. Your donor was a 46-year-old Hispanic female with a history of hyperlipidemia and a measured 24-hour urine creatinine clearance of 151 ml/min. Her HLA typing was A 2,31, B 35,44, Cw 4,5, DR 4,-, DQ 7,8. You were on intermittent hemodialysis for two years before the transplant. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's all correct. Doctor: Your induction therapy consisted of basiliximab and solumedrol, and your maintenance therapy has been with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. Your two-year course after the transplant has been unremarkable, with a baseline serum creatinine of 1.5–1.7 mg/dL (134–150 μmol/L), without proteinuria or hematuria. Is that right? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Have you experienced any flu-like illness recently? Patient: Yes, I had a flu-like illness about a week ago. Doctor: I understand you've admitted to inadvertently taking tacrolimus 1 mg q12h instead of your prescribed dose of 3 mg twice a day for almost a month, but corrected the dose approximately 3 weeks prior to the presentation. Is that accurate? Patient: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: During the examination, I found that you're normotensive and afebrile. Your cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were normal. You have periorbital edema and 6 mm pitting edema in your lower extremities. There was no graft tenderness or bruit. Is there anything else you'd like to share with me? Patient: No, that's everything. Doctor: Your recent laboratory data showed a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL (194 μmol/L). Your urinalysis showed moderate blood and 3+ protein (previously no proteinuria), with urinary sediment of more than 50 red blood cells (RBCs) and 11–20 white blood cells (WBCs) per high power field. This might be related to your recent flu-like illness and the change in your tacrolimus dosage. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We will need to closely monitor your condition and adjust your medications as needed. Please make sure to follow your prescribed dosages, and let us know if you experience any further symptoms or changes in your condition. Patient: Okay, I understand. Thank you, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care and feel free to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. [/INST] S: The patient, a 45-year-old Hispanic male with a history of end-stage renal disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a living related kidney transplant two years ago, presents with swelling in the lower extremities for the past three days. He reports a recent flu-like illness about a week ago and admits to a medication error with tacrolimus, taking 1 mg q12h instead of the prescribed 3 mg twice daily for nearly a month, corrected three weeks prior to presentation. O: Physical examination shows the patient is normotensive and afebrile with normal cardiovascular and respiratory examinations. Notable findings include periorbital edema and 6 mm pitting edema in the lower extremities, with no graft tenderness or bruit. Recent lab data reveals a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL (194 μmol/L), increased from a baseline of 1.5–1.7 mg/dL (134–150 μmol/L). Urinalysis indicates moderate blood and 3+ protein, with urinary sediment containing more than 50 RBCs and 11–20 WBCs per high power field. A: The assessment suggests acute kidney injury potentially related to recent flu-like illness and tacrolimus dosage error. Differential diagnoses include acute transplant rejection and infection-related glomerulonephritis. The increase in creatinine and presence of proteinuria and hematuria are concerning for graft dysfunction. P: The plan includes close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of immunosuppressive medications as needed. The patient is instructed to adhere strictly to the prescribed medication regimen and report any new symptoms or changes in his condition. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to reassess his condition and potentially modify treatment based on his response and lab results. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I have a fractured and discolored tooth in the front of my mouth. It happened three years ago, and I had a trauma to that area about five years back. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other issues with the tooth since the trauma? Patient: Yeah, sometimes I get pus discharge from my gums around the affected teeth, which are the right and left central incisor teeth. Doctor: Thank you for that information. Do you have any other medical issues we should be aware of? Patient: No, my medical history is pretty clear. Doctor: Great. Let's proceed with a clinical examination. *Examines patient* I can see an enamel fracture on tooth #11 and an enamel-dentin-pulp fracture on tooth #21. The prognosis for tooth #21 is guarded, so we will focus on tooth #11 for now. A regenerative procedure will be attempted for tooth #11. *Performs palpation and percussion tests* The tooth doesn't seem tender to palpation and percussion tests. How about sensitivity to cold and electric pulp testing? Patient: I don't feel any sensitivity to either cold or electric pulp testing. Doctor: That's good. There's no evidence of swelling or a sinus tract, and the tooth mobility is within physiological limits. We'll do a radiographic evaluation for further assessment. *Performs radiographic evaluation* The evaluation reveals an immature apex with thinned out root dentin near the apex of the root and periapical radiolucency. We'll also perform a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) Promax 3D to aid in diagnosis and treatment planning. Patient: Okay, sounds good. Doctor: *Reviews CBCT* With the help of the Planmeca Romexis software, I've recorded various linear dimensions of your tooth. The root length is 7.4 mm, and the root dentin thickness in the axial section measures 1.2 mm labially, 0.8 mm mesially, 0.8 mm lingually, and 0.8 mm distally, respectively. The volume of the periapical lesion was also measured using a Volux-Horos viewer for Mac. Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: Based on the findings, we'll proceed with a regenerative procedure for tooth #11 to address the enamel fracture and periapical lesion. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor the progress and ensure proper healing. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any concerns or notice any changes in the tooth, please don't hesitate to contact our office. Take care, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. [/INST] S: The patient presents with a chief complaint of a fractured and discolored tooth (#11 and #21), which occurred three years ago following a trauma five years ago. The patient reports occasional pus discharge from the gums around these teeth. No other medical issues were reported. O: Clinical examination revealed an enamel fracture on tooth #11 and an enamel-dentin-pulp fracture on tooth #21. Palpation and percussion tests showed no tenderness. Radiographic evaluation indicated an immature apex with thinned out root dentin near the apex and periapical radiolucency. CBCT using Planmeca Romexis software showed the root length of 7.4 mm and root dentin thickness measurements as follows: 1.2 mm labially, 0.8 mm mesially, 0.8 mm lingually, and 0.8 mm distally. The volume of the periapical lesion was also measured. A: The primary diagnosis is traumatic dental injuries to teeth #11 (enamel fracture) and #21 (enamel-dentin-pulp fracture). The prognosis for tooth #21 is guarded, while a regenerative procedure is planned for tooth #11 to address the enamel fracture and periapical lesion. P: Initiate a regenerative procedure for tooth #11. Schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor healing and progress. Educate the patient on signs to watch for, such as increased pain or discharge, and instruct to contact the office if these occur. Further treatment for tooth #21 will be considered based on the outcome of the regenerative procedure and ongoing assessments. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see that you've presented with a two-month history of right breast erythema and nipple erosion. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, my right breast has been red and swollen for the past couple of months, and my nipple has also been eroding. Doctor: I understand. We performed a needle core biopsy and it showed a grade two invasive ductal carcinoma. The estrogen receptor is 8/8, progesterone receptor is 4/8, and human epidermal growth factor receptor two is negative via silver in situ hybridization. There was also extensive lymphovascular and dermal invasion. We did a staging workup with axillary ultrasound, chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT), and bone scan, which revealed a conglomerated lymph node mass measuring 1.5 cm in the right level I-II axilla but no distant metastases (cT4dN1M0 [IIIC]). Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What does all that mean? Doctor: It means you have a type of breast cancer that has invaded the lymph nodes in your right axilla. We also noted that 13 years earlier, you had presented with Raynaud's phenomena, arthralgias, alopecia, malar rash, lupus nephritis, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. You were diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria and were treated with plasmapheresis, six months of cyclophosphamide, and 24 months of mycophenolate mofetil. You were then placed on irbesartan and maintenance hydroxychloroquine. Over the years, your SLE has remained stable with no other organ involvement.  Patient: Yes, that's correct. My autoimmune disease has been under control for quite some time now. Doctor: That's good to hear. To treat your breast cancer, you received three cycles of three weekly fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide followed by three cycles of three weekly docetaxel with clinically stable disease. One month later, you had a right total mastectomy, sentinel node biopsy with completion right-sided level I-II axillary dissection, and a prophylactic left-sided mastectomy. Pathology showed a 4-cm residual tumor and 3/15 nodes positive for residual disease (ypT4dN1aM0R0). Patient: How did my surgery go? Doctor: The surgery went well and you healed nicely afterward. We had a thorough discussion about the indications and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in the setting of well-established SLE, and you elected to proceed with RT. Patient: Yes, I remember that discussion. What is the next step for my treatment? Doctor: We will design the setup and treatment fields for RT to minimize lung and cardiac doses. All nonboost RT treatments will be performed accordingly to ensure the best possible outcome while minimizing risks. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your explanation and guidance throughout this process. [/INST] S: The patient reports a two-month history of right breast erythema and nipple erosion. She has a past medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), diagnosed 13 years ago, which has been stable with no recent organ involvement. She has been treated for breast cancer with chemotherapy and surgery. O: Physical examination previously confirmed right breast erythema and nipple erosion. Needle core biopsy revealed grade two invasive ductal carcinoma with extensive lymphovascular and dermal invasion. Hormone receptor status: estrogen receptor 8/8, progesterone receptor 4/8, HER2 negative. Staging workup showed a 1.5 cm conglomerated lymph node mass in the right level I-II axilla, no distant metastases (cT4dN1M0 [IIIC]). Post-surgery pathology indicated a 4-cm residual tumor, 3/15 nodes positive (ypT4dN1aM0R0). A: The primary diagnosis is grade two invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast, stage IIIC, with lymph node involvement but no distant metastases. The patient's history of SLE is a significant comorbidity that influences treatment options and risks, particularly concerning the use of radiotherapy. P: The patient completed initial chemotherapy and underwent right total mastectomy and axillary dissection, with a prophylactic left-sided mastectomy. Postoperative recovery was successful. The next step involves designing radiotherapy (RT) treatment fields to minimize exposure to the lungs and heart, considering her SLE. Continuous monitoring for SLE flare-ups and cancer recurrence will be necessary. Further consultations with rheumatology to manage her SLE during cancer treatment are recommended. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Anderson. How can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I had a minor accident recently. I fell and then a television set fell on the back of my neck. It's been hurting ever since. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you experienced any loss of consciousness, paresthesias, or weakness after the accident? Patient: No, I haven't. But I've been having more falls in the past two years. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history? Patient: I have schizophrenia and have been struggling with polysubstance abuse for a long time. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. What substances are you currently using? Patient: I use heroin and methamphetamine daily, and I also drink alcohol socially. I quit smoking twenty years ago. Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. I'm going to check your vital signs now. Your temperature is 37.3°C, blood pressure is 141/108 mmHg, heart rate is 105 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Patient: Hmm, alright. Doctor: Now I'm going to perform a physical examination. I can see that you're a thin, cachectic African American male. There are no obvious signs of trauma to your head or neck. Your cardiac examination shows sinus tachycardia, but no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Your lungs are clear to auscultation in all fields, and your abdomen is soft without distention or tenderness to palpation in all four quadrants. Your skin doesn't show any rashes, erythema, or trauma. Patient: Yes, it's just the neck pain that's bothering me. Doctor: I understand. In your neurological examination, I noticed cervical spinal tenderness but no step-off or gross deformity. Your strength is diffusely diminished (4/5 throughout bilateral upper and lower extremities), but there's no hyperreflexia or pathologic reflexes (negative Babinski and Hoffman tests). Anal wink is present, and sensation is preserved throughout. Patient: Okay, so what does all that mean? Doctor: Your laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5540/mm3 with normal differential, serum creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL (baseline 0.6 mg/dL), C-reactive protein (CRP) of 25.2 mg/L, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 48 mm/hr. Your urine drug screen is positive for amphetamines and opiates, as you mentioned. HIV testing is negative, but Hepatitis C testing is positive. Patient: Oh no, what should I do now? Doctor: We will need to address your Hepatitis C and monitor your other lab results. It's important to manage your substance abuse, as it can have significant consequences on your health. We will work with you to create a treatment plan that includes counseling and medical support. Additionally, we will need to investigate the cause of your increased falls and take appropriate measures to prevent future accidents. Patient: Alright, Doctor. I'm willing to work on my issues and get better. Thank you for your help. Doctor: You're welcome. We're here to support you through your journey to better health. [/INST] S: Patient reports persistent neck pain following an accident where a television fell on his neck. He denies loss of consciousness, paresthesias, or weakness post-accident but mentions an increase in falls over the past two years. The patient has a history of schizophrenia and long-term polysubstance abuse, currently using heroin, methamphetamine, and alcohol socially. He quit smoking twenty years ago. O: Vital signs show elevated blood pressure (141/108 mmHg), tachycardia (105 bpm), and increased respiratory rate (24 bpm). Physical examination reveals a thin, cachectic appearance with cervical spinal tenderness but no obvious signs of trauma, step-off, or gross deformity. Neurological examination shows diffusely diminished strength (4/5) without hyperreflexia or pathologic reflexes.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see you have a history of hypertension, 20 pack-years of smoking, thyroid cancer in remission with a partial thyroidectomy, and chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD). What brings you in today? Patient: I came to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain. Doctor: I see. We performed an abdominal ultrasound which showed gallstones, but no evidence of cholecystitis or biliary obstruction. You were diagnosed with biliary colic and discharged with a plan to perform an elective cholecystectomy. We also did a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen as part of the preoperative workup. It showed gallstones, small bilateral pleural effusions, and moderate pericardial effusion with high density suggestive of hemorrhage. Consequently, you were referred back to the emergency department for further workup. How are you feeling now? Patient: I'm not feeling any symptoms right now, actually. Doctor: That's good to hear. Upon your arrival, your vital signs were normal, and your physical examination was unremarkable. We did an electrocardiogram (EKG) which revealed a nonspecific interventricular conduction delay. A chest x-ray showed a mildly enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette with prominent perihilar opacities suggestive of a prominent vasculature.  Patient: Hmm, alright. Doctor: Your complete blood count and basic metabolic profile were within normal limits. We also did further laboratory workup, which showed normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, complement level, and procalcitonin, with negative serology for antinuclear antibodies and double-stranded DNA antibodies.  Patient: Okay, what does that mean for me? Doctor: We performed a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) which showed a large pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade, moderate aortic regurgitation, and normal left ventricular ejection fraction and size. Due to the large volume of pericardial effusion, we attempted a pericardial window. Patient: How did that go? Doctor: We successfully drained a total of one liter of hemorrhagic fluid. A pericardial tissue biopsy showed acute and chronic inflammatory cells with a thickened pericardium, but no malignant cells were detected. Patient: That's a relief! Were there any other tests done? Doctor: Yes, we performed a Tuberculosis quantiferon assay, acid-fast bacilli staining, and fungal and bacterial cultures of the pericardial tissue, all of which were negative.  Patient: So what's the source of the pericardial effusion then? Doctor: The source remains elusive. Given the hemorrhagic nature of the pericardial effusion in the absence of recent use of anticoagulation and the negative workup for infectious or autoimmune etiology, we will perform a CT scan of the chest with contrast to further investigate. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We will continue to monitor your condition and keep you informed. Please let us know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of hypertension, 20 pack-years of smoking, thyroid cancer in remission post-partial thyroidectomy, and chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), presented with acute abdominal pain. The patient reports no current symptoms. O: Initial abdominal ultrasound revealed gallstones without signs of cholecystitis or biliary obstruction. CT scan confirmed gallstones, small bilateral pleural effusions, and moderate pericardial effusion with high-density suggestive of hemorrhage. Vital signs were normal, and physical examination was unremarkable. EKG showed nonspecific interventricular conduction delay.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I hope you're doing well today. I understand that you underwent SMILE for myopia in both eyes back in June 2013 when you were 19 years old. Can you tell me if you've had any issues with your vision since then? Patient: Hi doctor, thanks for asking. I haven't had any major complaints about my vision. Doctor: That's good to hear. Now, I see that you have a history of eye rubbing and allergic conjunctivitis. Have you been experiencing any of those symptoms recently? Patient: Yes, I still have eye rubbing and sometimes I get episodes of allergic conjunctivitis. Doctor: I see. It's important to note that before your SMILE procedure, you had no history of pellucid marginal corneal degeneration and no family history of keratoconus or high myopia. Your preoperative characteristics and parameters are summarized in Table, and your preoperative topographies are presented in Fig. Your manifest refraction values were -6.75 DS with 1.00 DC × 45 in the right eye and -6.75 DS with 0.75 DC × 140 in the left eye, and your corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was 20/20 in both eyes. Patient: Hmm, yes, that's correct. Doctor: One month after your SMILE procedure, your uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) was 20/20 in both eyes, which is great. However, corneal topography revealed corneal ectasia. Posterior elevation was +21 μm in both eyes, and respective thinnest corneal thicknesses (TCTs) were 433 mm and 429 mm in the right and left eyes. The pachymetry examination showed a decentred elevation coincident with the thinnest point on the posterior surface. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: At 7.5 months, topography indicated posterior elevation of +29 μm in the right eye and +31 μm in the left. Respective TCTs were 445 mm and 426 mm in the right and left eyes. Patient: Okay. Doctor: At 14 months after SMILE, your UDVA had reduced to 20/32 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left. As you mentioned, you still have eye rubbing and intermittent episodes of allergic conjunctivitis after SMILE.  Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: To address this issue, simultaneous PTK and CXL (PTK + CXL) was performed in both eyes. Before CXL, the central 9.0-mm was assessed. Patient: Got it. Doctor: It's very important that we continue to monitor your vision and eye health, as well as manage your allergic conjunctivitis. Please make sure to attend your follow-up appointments and let me know if you have any concerns or notice any changes in your vision. Patient: Sure, I'll make sure to follow up with you, doctor. Thank you for explaining everything to me. [/INST] S: The patient, who underwent SMILE surgery for myopia in June 2013, reports no major complaints about vision since the procedure. However, the patient continues to experience eye rubbing and intermittent episodes of allergic conjunctivitis. There is no history of pellucid marginal corneal degeneration, keratoconus, or high myopia in the family. O: Preoperative characteristics included manifest refraction values of -6.75 DS with 1.00 DC × 45 in the right eye and -6.75 DS with 0.75 DC × 140 in the left eye, with a CDVA of 20/20 in both eyes. Post-SMILE, the patient's UDVA was 20/20 in both eyes at one month, but corneal topography showed corneal ectasia with posterior elevation of +21 μm and TCTs of 433 mm and 429 mm in the right and left eyes, respectively. At 7.5 months, posterior elevation increased to +29 μm in the right eye and +31 μm in the left, with TCTs of 445 mm and 426 mm. At 14 months post-SMILE, UDVA decreased to 20/32 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left. PTK + CXL was performed to address these issues. A: The primary diagnosis is post-SMILE corneal ectasia, evidenced by progressive posterior elevation and thinning of the cornea, along with a decrease in UDVA. Differential diagnoses could include progression of myopia or other corneal degenerative conditions. The patient's history of eye rubbing and allergic conjunctivitis may exacerbate the condition. P: The management plan includes regular monitoring of the patient's vision and corneal status, management of allergic conjunctivitis to prevent exacerbation of corneal ectasia, and adherence to follow-up appointments. The patient has been educated on the importance of avoiding eye rubbing and is advised to report any changes in vision or discomfort immediately. Further treatment options may be considered based on the progression of the corneal ectasia and response to initial management strategies. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented to our emergency department with right-sided chest pain. Can you tell me more about it? Patient: Yes, it started after I had a session of acupuncture and cupping ('ba guan') at a traditional medicine practitioner to treat my long-standing neck pain and intermittent numbness and tingling of both hands. Doctor: I see. Do you have any history of medical conditions? Patient: I had De Quervain's tenosynovitis of the left hand, which was released seven years ago. And I'm a non-smoker. Doctor: Okay. Did the chest pain occur while you were sitting down after receiving the treatment? Patient: Yes, that's right. I didn't have any trauma to my chest, but I did have some difficulty taking in breaths because of the pain. Doctor: Do you have any fever, cough, runny nose, or sore throat? Patient: No, I don't have any of those symptoms. Doctor: Alright. Based on your physical examination, you were afebrile, had a blood pressure of 99/63 mmHg, a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. You appeared alert, comfortable, and able to speak in full sentences. Your heart sounds were normal, and your breath sounds were slightly decreased on the right side. We also inspected your back and found multiple cupping and needling marks. Your abdomen was soft and non-tender, with no pedal edema. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: We conducted some initial investigations, including a normal complete blood count and metabolic panel. Your electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with no acute ST segment or T wave changes. Patient: That's good to hear. Doctor: However, the chest radiograph taken upon admission revealed a right-sided pneumothorax with an apical-cupola distance of 3.6 cm. Patient: Oh no, what does that mean? Doctor: It means that there is air in the space between your lung and chest wall, causing your lung to collapse partially. This could be the cause of your chest pain and difficulty breathing. Patient: What are the next steps, then? Doctor: We have put you on a non-rebreather mask with a FiO2 to help you breathe better. We will observe your condition closely and decide on further treatment if necessary. Patient: Alright, thank you for the information, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to help you recover. Please let us know if you experience any changes in your symptoms or if you have any concerns. [/INST] S: The patient, a non-smoker with a past medical history of De Quervain's tenosynovitis, presented with right-sided chest pain that started after a session of acupuncture and cupping. The pain occurred while sitting down post-treatment, with associated difficulty in breathing but no trauma. The patient denied any fever, cough, runny nose, or sore throat. O: Physical examination showed the patient was afebrile, with blood pressure at 99/63 mmHg, heart rate at 96 bpm, respiratory rate at 22 per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on room air. The patient appeared alert and comfortable. Heart sounds were normal, but breath sounds were slightly decreased on the right side. Examination revealed multiple cupping and needling marks on the back. The abdomen was soft and non-tender with no pedal edema. Laboratory tests including a complete blood count and metabolic panel were normal. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with no acute changes. Chest radiograph revealed a right-sided pneumothorax with an apical-cupola distance of 3.6 cm. A: Primary diagnosis is right-sided pneumothorax, likely induced by recent acupuncture and cupping therapy. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of acute chest pain, but clinical findings and imaging are consistent with pneumothorax. P: Immediate management includes oxygen therapy via a non-rebreather mask with a FiO2 to improve breathing. Close monitoring of respiratory status and repeat chest radiography will be necessary to assess the progression or resolution of the pneumothorax. Discussion regarding the risks associated with acupuncture and cupping in the context of the patient's symptoms and medical history is advised. Further treatment options may include conservative management with observation or surgical intervention if there is no improvement or worsening of the patient's condition. Patient education on recognizing symptoms of worsening pneumothorax and when to seek immediate care is crucial. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I am the doctor handling your daughter's case. I understand that she is a 2-year and six-month-old female patient from healthy unrelated parents, born at full-term by normal delivery and with a birth weight of 3.2 kg, right? Patient's Parent: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: I see that her perinatal period was unremarkable. However, at around 4 months of age, she was admitted to the local hospital due to vomiting. The laboratory findings showed that she suffered from metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia. She received treatment of potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate for a short time before the therapy was discontinued. Is that accurate? Patient's Parent: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: At about 2.5 years old, she was hospitalized in our renal unit because of recurrent hypokalemia, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and growth retardation. Physical examinations on admission showed her height (84.0 cm, <3rd percentile) and weight (10.1 kg, <3rd percentile) were lower than normal. Biochemical data revealed that she presented hypokalemia (2.7 mmol/l, normal 3.5–5.5 mmol/l), hyperchloremic (115 mmol/l, normal 99-110 mmol/l), and metabolic acidosis (pH 7.28, normal 7.35–7.45). Patient's Parent: Yes, we were really worried about her growth and overall health. Doctor: To make a definite diagnosis, we performed a renal ultrasound and audiological assessment. The renal ultrasound indicated bilateral nephrocalcinosis. The Automated Auditory Brainstem Response (AABR) test revealed that she has bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, with moderately severe (45 dB) on the left ear and severe (80 dB) on the right ear. This was accompanied by EVA on both sides, determined by high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT). Patient's Parent: Oh no, that's terrible. What can we do for her? Doctor: To identify the pathogenic gene mutation causing her condition, we extracted genomic DNA from her peripheral blood and her parents' blood using a Blood genome DNA Extraction kit. This will help us understand the underlying cause and determine the best course of action for her treatment. Patient's Parent: Thank you for doing everything you can to help our daughter. We appreciate it. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor her condition closely and provide the necessary treatment to manage her symptoms. We'll also keep you informed of any updates regarding her diagnosis and treatment plan. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. [/INST] S: The patient is a 2-year and six-month-old female with a history of metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia starting at 4 months, treated with potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate. Recently, she presented with recurrent hypokalemia, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and growth retardation. The parents are concerned about her growth and overall health. O: On physical examination, the patient's height and weight are below the 3rd percentile (height 84.0 cm, weight 10.1 kg). Laboratory findings include hypokalemia (2.7 mmol/l), hyperchloremia (115 mmol/l), and metabolic acidosis (pH 7.28). Renal ultrasound showed bilateral nephrocalcinosis. Auditory tests revealed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, more severe in the right ear (80 dB) than the left (45 dB), with accompanying enlarged vestibular aqueducts (EVA) on HR-CT. Genetic testing is underway to identify the causative mutation. A: The patient is assessed with chronic kidney disease likely due to an underlying genetic disorder, indicated by nephrocalcinosis and sensorineural hearing loss with EVA. Differential diagnoses could include conditions like Bartter syndrome or other tubulopathies. The prognosis depends on the specific diagnosis and response to treatment. P: Continue monitoring electrolytes and acid-base balance. Manage metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia with appropriate electrolyte supplementation. Genetic counseling for the family and further genetic testing to confirm diagnosis. Regular follow-up in renal and audiology clinics is essential. Educate the parents about the importance of treatment adherence and regular monitoring. Prepare for potential interventions based on genetic test results. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I understand you're a cyclist and you had a fall during a race. Can you tell me what happened? Patient: Yeah, I was in a race and a rider ahead of me fell, so I swerved to avoid him but ended up falling on my left side and hitting a tree with my right leg. I was wearing a helmet, so I didn't suffer any head or chest trauma. Doctor: I see. And what brought you to the emergency department today? Patient: After the fall, I felt lightheaded and broke out in a cold sweat. I also have mid-back pain, but no chest pains or shortness of breath. They brought me here in an ambulance right after the accident. Doctor: Okay, let me check your vitals. Your initial blood pressure was 128/69 mmHg, and your pulse was 65 beats per minute. You're not running a fever, and your breathing is normal. I noticed that your right thigh is swollen and tender. We also did an ECG due to your dizziness and diaphoresis, and it showed lateral ST segment elevation. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It could indicate an issue with your heart, so we ran some more tests. Your troponin I level was positive at 0.49ng/mL, and your Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) was 617 U/L. We were initially concerned about a possible cardiac contusion, but you didn't have any chest trauma. We admitted you for further evaluation. Patient: What did you find during the evaluation? Doctor: As an inpatient, we performed an echocardiogram, which showed normal right and left ventricular function and a trace of pericardial effusion. Your troponin levels continued to rise, reaching a maximum of 21ng/mL. We started you on Aspirin, Clopidogrel, a heparin infusion, Lisinopril, and a Beta Blocker. Patient: What's the next step? Doctor: We did a coronary angiography, which revealed a spontaneous coronary artery dissection in your left anterior descending coronary artery. We didn't perform any further diagnostic studies at the time. I also understand from your history that you took several caffeine Jello shots and had an energy drink before the race. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Caffeine can sometimes contribute to heart issues like the one you experienced. For now, we'll continue to monitor your condition and keep you on the medications I mentioned earlier. It's important to follow up with your primary care physician and a cardiologist for further evaluation and management. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything. I'll make sure to follow up with my doctors. [/INST] S: The patient, a cyclist, reports falling during a race, avoiding another fallen rider, and colliding with a tree.

O: Initial vital signs showed a blood pressure of 128/69 mmHg, pulse 65 bpm, normal temperature, and respiration. Physical examination revealed right thigh swelling and tenderness. ECG indicated lateral ST segment elevation. Lab tests showed elevated troponin I at 0.49 ng/mL (normal <0.04 ng/mL) and CPK at 617 U/L (normal 22-198 U/L). Echocardiogram displayed normal ventricular function with a trace of pericardial effusion. Coronary angiography identified a spontaneous coronary artery dissection in the left anterior descending artery. A: Primary diagnosis is spontaneous coronary artery dissection, likely exacerbated by physical trauma and caffeine intake. Differential diagnosis included cardiac contusion, initially suspected due to the patient's symptoms but ruled out by the absence of chest trauma and further diagnostic results. P: Management included administration of Aspirin, Clopidogrel, heparin infusion, Lisinopril, and a Beta Blocker. The patient was advised to continue these medications and monitor his condition closely. Recommendations were made for follow-up with a primary care physician and a cardiologist for ongoing evaluation and management. The patient was educated on the potential impact of caffeine on heart health and advised to moderate intake. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you've been referred to our hospital due to leukocytosis. How have you been feeling lately? Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling okay. I don't have any noticeable symptoms. Doctor: Alright, let's go over your blood examination results. You have eosinophilia with a WBC count of 15.7 × 109/L, which includes 28% neutrophils, 55% eosinophils, 1% basophils, 3% monocytes, and 13% lymphocytes. Your hemoglobin is 13.0 g/dl, and your platelet count is 339 × 109/L. Your LDH levels are a bit high at 232 U/L, with the normal range being 100-220 U/L. However, your liver and renal functions are normal. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: Since we haven't identified any clinical symptoms or organ damage, I suggest a regular monthly follow-up for now. Let's see how your condition progresses. Patient: Okay, that sounds reasonable. (After 4 months) Patient: Doctor, I've developed some respiratory symptoms like cough and dyspnea over the past few months. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll need to do a chest X-ray and a computed tomography (CT) scan to investigate further.  (After the tests) Doctor: Your chest X-ray and CT scanning results show bilateral lung infiltrates. We also performed a bronchoscopy and obtained bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which revealed an increased probability of eosinophils - 20.5% eosinophils, 78.0% macrophages, 1.0% lymphocytes, and 0.5% neutrophils. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: Based on these findings, you've been diagnosed with acute eosinophilic pneumonia. We'll begin treatment with prednisone at a dose of 0.5 mg kg−1 day−1. Patient: Will this treatment help with my symptoms? Doctor: Yes, the treatment with prednisone should improve the shadow of infiltrates on the X-ray and your respiratory symptoms. However, it may not reduce the increased number of eosinophils in circulation. Therefore, we'll carry out a bone marrow examination as well. (After the bone marrow examination) Doctor: The bone marrow examination showed normocellularity with elevated eosinophils at 22.1% of nuclear cells, without blastoid cell proliferation (0%). Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow revealed 46, XY, t(2;5)(q37;q31) [16/20]/46, XY [4/20]. FISH analysis in the peripheral blood leukocytes showed the presence of a split signal at PDGFRB. Additionally, WT1 mRNA was positively expressed at 1,200 copies/μg RNA in the peripheral blood. Patient: What do these results mean for me? Doctor: The detection of PDGFRB rearrangement means that you're a candidate for a targeted therapy called imatinib. This medication will be added to your treatment plan to help manage your condition. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance. [/INST] S: The patient was initially asymptomatic but referred for leukocytosis. Over the past few months, the patient developed respiratory symptoms including cough and dyspnea. O: Initial labs showed WBC 15.7 × 10^9/L with 55% eosinophils, hemoglobin 13.0 g/dl, platelet count 339 × 10^9/L, and LDH 232 U/L. Chest X-ray and CT scan revealed bilateral lung infiltrates. Bronchoalveolar lavage indicated 20.5% eosinophils. Bone marrow examination showed normocellularity with 22.1% eosinophils and cytogenetic analysis revealed 46, XY, t(2;5)(q37;q31). FISH analysis showed a split signal at PDGFRB, and WT1 mRNA was expressed at 1,200 copies/μg RNA. A: The patient is diagnosed with acute eosinophilic pneumonia complicated by an underlying hematological disorder characterized by PDGFRB rearrangement, suggesting a possible myeloproliferative disorder. P: Initiated treatment with prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day for eosinophilic pneumonia. Planned to add imatinib for targeted therapy due to PDGFRB rearrangement. Regular follow-ups are scheduled to monitor the response to treatment and adjust as necessary. Further education on the disease process and treatment plan was provided to ensure patient compliance and understanding. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I was diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma back in 2010. Doctor: I see. Did you have any treatments for that? Patient: Yes, I had a lumpectomy and chemoradiation afterward. Doctor: Alright. What brings you here today? Patient: I'm considering having a mastectomy of my left breast with autologous breast reconstruction. Doctor: Okay. Let's discuss your medical history. Have you had any issues with blood clotting or thrombosis? Patient: Yes, I have a history of heterozygous FVL and a previous lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. I was on warfarin therapy for 2 years. Doctor: Thank you for the information. In your case, we can perform a left completion mastectomy with neurotized DIEP flap reconstruction. However, due to your history of clotting, we need to take some precautions. Patient: What kind of precautions? Doctor: During the surgery, if there is clotting noted prior to performing the anastomosis, we will irrigate the vessels with tissue plasminogen activator solution. Additionally, you will be given an intravenous dose of 3000 units of UFH. Patient: Okay, that sounds reasonable. Doctor: After the surgery, we will need to closely monitor your lab values, including thrombocyte count, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). We will use the TEG 5000 Thromboelastograph Hemostasis System to perform these tests. Patient: Alright. What can I expect during my recovery? Doctor: At your 1-year follow-up, we would expect your flaps and abdominal scar to be inconspicuous. You might need additional symmetry breast revision procedures, as shown in Fig. Patient: I see. Are there any specific medications I should be aware of? Doctor: Your medications will be listed in Table, but we will discuss them in detail before and after the surgery to ensure you are on the proper regimen. Patient: Great. Thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask. We're here to help you through this process. [/INST] S: The patient, previously diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma in 2010, underwent lumpectomy and chemoradiation. She reports a history of heterozygous Factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation and a previous episode of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, treated with warfarin for 2 years. She is currently considering a left mastectomy with autologous breast reconstruction. O: The patient's past medical interventions include lumpectomy and chemoradiation for breast cancer, and warfarin therapy for deep venous thrombosis due to FVL mutation. Proposed surgical plan includes left completion mastectomy with neurotized DIEP flap reconstruction. Precautions for her clotting history involve intraoperative irrigation of vessels with tissue plasminogen activator and administration of 3000 units of unfractionated heparin (UFH) intravenously. Postoperative monitoring will include thrombocyte count, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) using the TEG 5000 Thromboelastograph Hemostasis System. A: Primary diagnosis is a history of infiltrating ductal carcinoma with a current consideration for left mastectomy and autologous reconstruction. The patient's clotting disorder (heterozygous FVL) complicates the surgical approach, requiring specific intraoperative and postoperative management strategies to mitigate thrombosis risk. P: Proceed with the planned left completion mastectomy and neurotized DIEP flap reconstruction, incorporating specified clotting precautions. Postoperative care will include close monitoring of coagulation parameters and potential adjustment of anticoagulation therapy as needed. Discuss detailed medication regimen pre- and post-surgery. Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor recovery and discuss potential need for additional symmetry breast revision procedures. Educate the patient on signs of complications and ensure understanding of medication regimen. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you've been admitted to the emergency department due to chest pain for the past 4 hours. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling lately? Patient: Yeah, actually I've been suffering from fatigue after activity for more than 10 days now. And I've had this chest tightness and chest pain for 4 days before I came in. Doctor: I see. Looking at your medical history, it seems that you are a taekwondo trainee and have a healthy body with no remarkable family history. We performed a computed tomographic (CT) scan which showed a thickened aortic wall, bilateral pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion.  Patient: Oh, what does that mean? Doctor: The cardiac ultrasound also suggested aortic hematoma or dissection. Based on your condition and the examination results, we are considering the possibility of aortic dissection. Patient: That sounds serious. What's the next step? Doctor: After excluding any surgical contraindications, we will perform an emergency operation which includes ascending aortic replacement and aortic arch replacement. We will also develop postoperative treatment measures such as anti-infection, adjustment of cardiac function, nutritional nerve support, and symptomatic supportive treatment. Patient: Okay, and how long will it take for me to recover? Doctor: You should recover well and be discharged after about 15 days. The cause of the aortic dissection is unclear at the moment, but we will extract arterial tissues and pericardial tissues during the surgery for further pathological examination. Patient: Hmm, I see. Doctor: The postoperative pathology of the aortic wall tissue showed aortitis, which includes visible necrosis, granulation tissue hyperplasia, and a large number of acute and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration. Although we didn't initially consider GPA-induced aortitis or aortic dissection as a cause, this event has led us to study it further. Patient: So, what should I do after I get discharged? Doctor: You should come back for a follow-up examination. In fact, on the first day of 2017, you were re-examined for aortic CT because of a 6-day fever and right chest pain. The good news is that the prognosis for your aortic dissection was good after the review. Patient: That's a relief. Thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, a taekwondo trainee, presented with chest pain persisting for 4 hours and associated symptoms of fatigue after activity for over 10 days, and chest tightness for 4 days. The patient has no significant family medical history. O: Vital signs were not provided. CT scan revealed a thickened aortic wall, bilateral pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion. Cardiac ultrasound suggested aortic hematoma or dissection. Postoperative pathology indicated aortitis with necrosis, granulation tissue hyperplasia, and infiltration of acute and chronic inflammatory cells. A: The primary diagnosis is aortic dissection with complications including aortitis. Differential diagnosis initially considered was GPA-induced aortitis. The prognosis is good based on recent follow-up. P: The patient underwent emergency ascending aortic and aortic arch replacement. Postoperative treatment included anti-infection measures, cardiac function adjustment, nutritional nerve support, and symptomatic supportive treatment. The patient is advised to return for follow-up examinations, and further pathological studies of arterial and pericardial tissues are planned to investigate the cause of the aortic dissection. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me what brings you in today? Patient: Hi, I've been having a rash along with muscle pain and fever for about a week now. Doctor: I see. Where exactly is the rash located? Patient: It's on both of my arms, legs, neck, and forehead. Doctor: Hmm, okay. Let me take a closer look. There seem to be multiple open and intact vesicles associated with erythematous subcutaneous tender nodules. I also noticed clear, serous discharge from the vesicles. We'll need to do a biopsy and some laboratory tests to better understand what's going on. Patient: Alright, sure. (After the tests) Doctor: The biopsy of the crusted lesion over your left knee revealed a vesiculated subepidermal layer with histiocytic inflammation of the dermis. Your laboratory examination showed a WBC count of 11.7 × 103/µL with an AEC of 1200 cells/µL. The chest X-ray showed right upper lobe inflammatory infiltration. Patient: What does that mean, doctor? Doctor: It means that there is inflammation in the skin and a slightly elevated white blood cell count, as well as inflammation in the right upper lobe of your lung. We also did a coccidioidal serology test, which showed reactive ID-IgM and weakly reactive ID-IgG. However, your CF antibody titer is <1:2. Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: I'm going to discharge you, but it's important that you follow up with us so we can continue to monitor your condition and determine the best course of action. Patient: Okay, I understand. I'll make sure to follow up. (After some time, the patient is lost to follow-up) Patient's Family Member: Hi, doctor. I just wanted to inform you that my family member, who you treated for a rash and inflammation, has unfortunately passed away. We wanted to thank you for your efforts. Doctor: I'm truly sorry for your loss. Please accept my deepest condolences. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me. [/INST] S: Patient reported experiencing a rash, muscle pain, and fever for about a week. The rash was located on both arms, legs, neck, and forehead.  O: Physical examination revealed multiple open and intact vesicles with erythematous subcutaneous tender nodules and serous discharge. Biopsy of a crusted lesion over the left knee showed a vesiculated subepidermal layer with histiocytic inflammation of the dermis. Laboratory tests indicated a WBC count of 11.7 × 10^3/µL (normal: 4.5-11.0 × 10^3/µL) with an AEC of 1200 cells/µL (normal: 100-500 cells/µL). Chest X-ray demonstrated right upper lobe inflammatory infiltration. Coccidioidal serology was reactive for ID-IgM and weakly reactive for ID-IgG; CF antibody titer was <1:2. A: The patient's clinical presentation and diagnostic findings suggest a severe systemic infection, likely coccidioidomycosis, given the reactive coccidioidal serology. Differential diagnoses could include other infectious or autoimmune etiologies contributing to the vesicular rash and systemic symptoms. The prognosis was uncertain, requiring close follow-up. P: The initial plan included discharging the patient with instructions for follow-up to monitor the condition and adjust treatment as necessary. However, the patient was lost to follow-up and subsequently passed away, as reported by a family member. The importance of adherence to follow-up appointments was critical in this case. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. Can you please tell me what happened to the patient? Patient's family: Our 17-year-old daughter was in a severe accident. She's a bicyclist and was rolled over by a truck. It was a really traumatic experience for her. Doctor: I'm so sorry to hear that. Can you describe her condition when the first responders arrived? Patient's family: Yes, she was awake, alert, and following commands. But when they lifted the truck, she suddenly became unstable as the pressure on her pelvis decreased. Doctor: That must have been very frightening. It sounds like she became hypotensive and needed cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Did they apply a pelvic binder and perform endotracheal intubation at the accident scene? Patient's family: Yes, they did all that before admitting her to your trauma center by ambulance. Doctor: Good, that's important for her treatment. It seems they had some difficulty establishing intravenous access, so they placed an intraosseous needle into her left proximal tibia. Is that correct? Patient's family: Yes, that's right. Doctor: After her arrival, we followed the ATLS® principles for primary survey, applied a pelvic C-clamp, and activated a massive transfusion protocol. She received 10 units of concentrated blood and 10 units of fresh frozen plasma. In cases like this, if the patient doesn't respond, our next step is immediate emergency surgery. Patient's family: So, did you perform the surgery? Doctor: We decided to perform a Venae sectio and establish a REBOA with a surgical approach to her left femoral artery. We used a conventional aortic stent graft balloon catheter as an occlusion device. Patient's family: Was the insertion of the catheter successful? Doctor: The initial insertion was successful, but we couldn't advance the catheter beyond the inguinal region. Due to this complication, we transferred her to the operating room for further treatment. Patient's family: How did the surgery go? Doctor: Unfortunately, despite maximum therapy and after 100 minutes of ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, she passed away before we could complete the surgical steps. Patient's family: That's so heartbreaking. What happened during the surgery? Doctor: We carried out an emergency laparotomy with a standard midline approach and found exsanguinating bleeding in her pelvis. We also discovered the reason for the insufficient catheter placement. Patient's family: What was the reason? Doctor: The catheter had been inserted correctly into her femoral artery, but it couldn't be advanced further. We did everything we could, but her injuries were just too severe. I'm so sorry for your loss. [/INST] S: The patient, a 17-year-old female bicyclist, was involved in a severe accident where she was rolled over by a truck. The family reported that she was initially awake, alert, and following commands at the scene but became unstable and hypotensive after the truck was lifted off her. The family expressed that the experience was traumatic for her. O: Upon arrival at the trauma center, the patient was treated according to ATLS® principles. She had an intraosseous needle placed in her left proximal tibia at the scene and received a pelvic C-clamp and massive transfusion protocol at the hospital, including 10 units of concentrated blood and 10 units of fresh frozen plasma. A Venae sectio and REBOA were attempted via the left femoral artery, but the catheter could not be advanced beyond the inguinal region. Emergency laparotomy revealed exsanguinating bleeding in the pelvis. A: The primary diagnosis was traumatic pelvic injury with severe hemorrhage. The patient underwent multiple resuscitative efforts including massive transfusion and emergency surgery. Despite these interventions, she succumbed to her injuries. Differential diagnosis would consider other trauma-related complications, but the immediate cause of instability and death was hemorrhagic shock secondary to pelvic trauma. P: The management plan included immediate resuscitation, massive transfusion protocol, surgical intervention with REBOA and emergency laparotomy. Following the unfortunate outcome, the plan involves providing support to the family, discussing the events and management steps taken, and offering grief counseling. Further administrative steps will include a review of the case to ensure all appropriate protocols were followed and to learn from the tragic event. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi doctor, I've been having a fever for 10 days now, along with a headache, generalized myalgia, and a rash on my lower limbs. Doctor: I see. Have you taken any antibiotics before the rash appeared? Patient: No, there's no history of antibiotic therapy. Doctor: Have you experienced any vomiting, visual complaints, confusion, or neck pain during this time? Patient: Nope, I haven't suffered from any of those symptoms. Doctor: Can you tell me about your occupation and if you have any contact with animals? Patient: I'm a lorry driver for an oil-palm plantation, and I frequently come into contact with rats around the oil-palm factories. Doctor: Have you had any recent travel or participated in any water-based recreational activities in forests? Patient: No, there's been no report of recent travel or involvement in any such activities. Doctor: Alright. Your medical history seems not significant. Let's proceed with a physical examination. *After examination* Doctor: You appear alert and orientated. Your vital signs show an oral temperature of 39 °C, blood pressure of 110/77 mmHg, pulse rate of 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Your qSOFA score is 0, which is a good sign. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: Upon skin examination, I noticed erythematous macular papular rashes over both lower limbs, sparing the palms and soles. There are no visible eschars. Your eyes appear normal, and there are no palpable cervical lymph nodes, mouth ulcers, or myositis. Patient: Yes, that's what I've been experiencing. Doctor: Your cardio-respiratory examination is unremarkable, and there's no organomegaly detected in the abdominal examination. We'll need to run some laboratory tests to further assess your condition. *After receiving lab results* Doctor: Your initial laboratory parameters show white cell counts of 7.9 × 10^9 cell/L, which is within the reference range of 4.0–12.0 × 10^9 cell/L. You have mild thrombocytopenia at 126 × 10^9 cell/L, with the reference range being 150–440 × 10^9 cell/L. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: Your serum creatinine level is normal at 99 µmol/L, within the reference range of 62–106 µmol/L. However, you have hyponatremia with a sodium level of 127 mmol/L, which is slightly below the reference range of 136–145 mmol/L. Patient: What does that mean, doctor? Doctor: It means you have a low sodium level in your blood. Additionally, your liver enzymes are moderately elevated, which we need to monitor closely. Patient: Alright, so what do I need to do now? Doctor: I'll prescribe appropriate medications for your symptoms, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor your progress. In the meantime, it's essential to maintain proper hygiene and avoid contact with rats. Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to follow your recommendations. [/INST] S: Patient, a lorry driver, presents with a 10-day history of fever, headache, generalized myalgia, and a rash on lower limbs. Denies any history of antibiotic use, vomiting, visual complaints, confusion, neck pain, recent travel, or water-based recreational activities. Reports frequent contact with rats at work. O: Physical examination shows an alert and oriented patient with vital signs: temperature 39 °C, blood pressure 110/77 mmHg, pulse 88 bpm, respiratory rate 18 bpm, and SpO2 98% on room air. Skin examination reveals erythematous macular papular rashes on both lower limbs, sparing palms and soles, no eschars, normal eyes, no palpable cervical lymph nodes, mouth ulcers, or myositis. Cardio-respiratory and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. Lab results indicate WBC 7.9 × 10^9 cell/L, mild thrombocytopenia at 126 × 10^9 cell/L, normal serum creatinine at 99 µmol/L, hyponatremia with sodium at 127 mmol/L, and moderately elevated liver enzymes. A: Differential diagnosis includes viral exanthems, leptospirosis, or other zoonotic infections, considering the patient's occupational exposure to rats. The presence of fever, rash, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, and elevated liver enzymes supports an infectious etiology. The absence of neck stiffness, confusion, and other meningeal signs makes central nervous system infections less likely. P: Initiate empirical antibiotic therapy targeting potential zoonotic infections. Advise the patient to maintain strict personal hygiene and minimize contact with rats. Schedule a follow-up in one week to reassess symptoms and lab parameters. Educate the patient on the signs of worsening infection and instruct to return earlier if symptoms escalate. Consider referral to an infectious disease specialist if no improvement or if diagnosis remains uncertain after initial treatment and evaluation. </s>"

Patient: Hi, I came to the emergency department because my low back pain has been getting worse and I'm having trouble walking and maintaining an upright posture. Doctor: I see. Have you had any fever or issues with bowel and bladder dysfunction? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those problems. Doctor: Can you tell me a bit about your past medical history? Patient: Well, I've had issues with alcohol abuse and pancreatitis. I also have a history of chronic low back and bilateral leg pain. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Have you had any surgeries related to these issues? Patient: Yes, I had a L4-S1 posterior and interbody fusion in 2012 and an extreme lateral interbody fusion of L3-4 four months ago for adjacent segment degeneration and stenosis. Doctor: Alright. I'll perform a physical exam now. *Examines patient* I noticed that you have diffuse weakness in your bilateral lower extremity key muscles, rated 3-4/5. We need to run some tests to rule out infection. We'll check your white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patient: Okay, thank you. *After test results* Doctor: Your test results for infection came back negative. However, we did find some issues in your lumbar x-ray. The L3-4 implanted cage has developed significant cavitation around it, and there are new compression fractures at the vertebral bodies of L1 and L2. Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We also performed a lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast, which demonstrated diffuse edema and enhancement of the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies. This suggests a possible infection as the primary cause. We also did an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out any intra-abdominal involvement, which was negative. Patient: So, what's the plan now? Doctor: Given the findings and the possibility of an acute infection causing segmental instability, we will need to perform a two-stage surgical intervention. In the first stage, we'll remove your existing L4-S1 posterior hardware and perform spinal canal decompression. This will allow us to retrieve the loose L3-4 interbody implant and take tissue samples for culture and pathology. Patient: And what about the second stage? Doctor: In the second stage, we'll achieve spinal stabilization by placing an antibiotic-impregnated temporary polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) spacer. This should help with the suspected infection and provide stability to your spine. Patient: I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll make sure to monitor your progress closely after the surgery and address any concerns that may arise. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask. Patient: Thank you, I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, a middle-aged individual with a history of alcohol abuse, pancreatitis, chronic low back pain, and bilateral leg pain, presented to the emergency department complaining of worsening low back pain and difficulty walking and maintaining an upright posture. The patient denies fever or bowel and bladder dysfunction. Past surgical history includes L4-S1 posterior and interbody fusion in 2012 and extreme lateral interbody fusion of L3-4 four months ago due to adjacent segment degeneration and stenosis. O: Physical examination revealed diffuse weakness in bilateral lower extremity key muscles, rated 3-4/5. Laboratory tests for infection markers (white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) returned negative. Lumbar x-ray showed significant cavitation around the L3-4 implanted cage and new compression fractures at L1 and L2 vertebral bodies. Lumbar MRI with contrast indicated diffuse edema and enhancement of the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies, suggesting a possible infection. Abdominal and pelvic CT scan was negative for intra-abdominal involvement. A: The primary diagnosis is suspected spinal infection at L3-L4 with segmental instability, compounded by mechanical failure of the spinal hardware and new compression fractures. Differential diagnosis includes non-infectious inflammatory processes or mechanical instability without infection. P: The management plan includes a two-stage surgical intervention. The first stage involves removal of the existing L4-S1 posterior hardware, spinal canal decompression, retrieval of the loose L3-4 interbody implant, and tissue sampling for culture and pathology. The second stage will focus on spinal stabilization using an antibiotic-impregnated PMMA spacer to address the suspected infection and provide structural support. Postoperative monitoring and follow-up will be essential to assess recovery and manage any arising complications. Further consultations with infectious disease specialists and continued rehabilitation will be necessary to optimize recovery and functionality. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you presented in 2010 with galactorrhoea and oligomenorrhea that had been going on for 4 years. Can you tell me more about that? Patient: Yes, I had been experiencing galactorrhea since the birth of my last son when I was 31, and my periods were irregular. Doctor: I understand. Your past medical history also includes a right nephrectomy following a road traffic accident as a child, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: When we did an endocrinology assessment, we found that your serum prolactin was raised at 1444 mu/L, with suppressed gonadotrophins and oestradiol. You weren't taking any medication at the time, right? Patient: No, I wasn't taking any medication. Doctor: Your renal function and thyroid function were both normal at that time. We also did a pituitary MR scan, which showed a 6 mm diameter microadenoma with inferior extension towards the sphenoid sinus on the left hand side. You also suffered from headaches and visual disturbance, but the tumour was confined within the sella turcica and was not thought to be causal. Based on these findings, we diagnosed you with a microprolactinoma.  Patient: Yes, I remember that. Doctor: After your eldest daughter passed away in her early 20s in 2013 from ovarian cancer, your family underwent genetic testing. You, your mother, and your half-sister were found to carry a DICER1 gene mutation. There's no other significant family history of pituitary disorders, correct? Patient: That's right. Doctor: As part of the DICER1 follow-up, you've had regular scans of your thyroid, which revealed the expected multinodular goitre. In 2018, you were diagnosed with differentiated papillary carcinoma thyroid. Have you been experiencing any new symptoms or concerns recently? Patient: No, nothing new since then. Doctor: Alright, please continue with the follow-up appointments and inform us of any changes in your condition. We will continue monitoring your thyroid and managing your microprolactinoma.

She also has a family history of ovarian cancer and carries a DICER1 gene mutation, with a diagnosis of differentiated papillary carcinoma of the thyroid in 2018. O: Previous assessments revealed elevated serum prolactin levels at 1444 mu/L, with suppressed gonadotrophins and oestradiol. Renal and thyroid functions were normal. A pituitary MR scan showed a 6 mm microadenoma with inferior extension towards the sphenoid sinus on the left side. The patient's headaches and visual disturbances were noted, but the tumor was confined within the sella turcica and not deemed causal to these symptoms. A: The primary diagnosis is microprolactinoma, with a secondary diagnosis of differentiated papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. The patient's genetic predisposition due to the DICER1 mutation contributes to her complex endocrine profile. The absence of new symptoms suggests stable conditions under current management. P: Continue regular monitoring of the thyroid and management of the microprolactinoma. The patient should maintain scheduled follow-up appointments and report any new symptoms or concerns. Further genetic counseling and surveillance for related conditions due to DICER1 mutation may be advised. Encourage compliance with ongoing treatment and follow-up protocols. </s>"

Patient: I was seen first at 23 weeks 4 days, and then by 27 weeks 5 days, I was admitted for vaginal bleeding. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It seems that after further evaluation by ultrasound, the diagnosis of placenta percreta was made, which was later confirmed by MRI. Have you experienced any other issues? Patient: Yes, at 29 weeks, I had constipation and 2 episodes of urinary retention. I was put on continuous bladder drainage after that. Doctor: It appears that you also developed a urinary tract infection and were treated with appropriate antibiotics based on culture sensitivity. Did the bleeding and constipation continue? Patient: Yes, I continued to have repeated bouts of vaginal bleeding of varying amounts and severe constipation from 31 weeks of gestation. Doctor: It seems that at 32 weeks 4 days, you underwent a cystoscopy. The results showed signs of cystitis with no definite infiltration. You then underwent a classical cesarean section under combined anesthesia with Epidural and General. How did that go? Patient: The umbilical cord was tied near the insertion, and the placenta was left in situ because there was no spontaneous separation. The uterus was closed after that. Doctor: I see that prophylactic temporary bilateral internal iliac artery balloons were inserted and inflated earlier. Uterine artery embolization was performed post cesarean section, and selective angiograms confirmed adequate positioning. Patient: But I still had incomplete embolization with the lower part of the uterus showing some unblocked branches on both sides. Doctor: I understand. Post-operatively, you were transferred to the labor ward, and within 4 hours, you developed clinical features of pulmonary embolism (PE). Some of your symptoms included a drop in O2 saturation to 81%, tachycardia, chest pain, peripheral cyanosis, and signs of respiratory distress. You were then transferred to the ICU and initiated on heparin infusion. Patient: That's right. My chest X-ray didn't show any atelectasis, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion, but I was still very worried. Doctor: An immediate CT scan was done to check for pulmonary embolism, and there was no evidence of it. Additionally, Doppler tests showed no evidence of venous thrombosis in the femoral and popliteal venous systems. This is good news, but we will continue to monitor your condition closely. Patient: Thank you for all the information, doctor. I appreciate your help and will follow all the necessary steps for a healthy recovery. [/INST] S: The patient, a multiparous woman (Gravida 6, Parity 3) with a history of two miscarriages and three cesarean sections, reports current pregnancy complications. She was first seen at 23 weeks 4 days due to issues and admitted at 27 weeks 5 days for vaginal bleeding. She was diagnosed with placenta percreta, confirmed by MRI. At 29 weeks, she experienced constipation and urinary retention, requiring continuous bladder drainage. Despite treatment for a urinary tract infection, she continued to suffer from vaginal bleeding and severe constipation from 31 weeks. She underwent a classical cesarean section at 32 weeks 4 days, where the placenta was left in situ and prophylactic measures like bilateral internal iliac artery balloons and uterine artery embolization were employed. Post-operatively, she developed symptoms suggestive of pulmonary embolism, but subsequent tests ruled out PE and venous thrombosis. O: On examination, the patient showed signs of cystitis without definite infiltration during cystoscopy. Post-cesarean, she exhibited clinical features of pulmonary embolism including a drop in O2 saturation to 81%, tachycardia, chest pain, peripheral cyanosis, and respiratory distress, but CT and Doppler tests were negative for PE and venous thrombosis. Her chest X-ray was clear of atelectasis, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. A: The primary diagnosis is placenta percreta with complications including severe constipation, urinary retention, and suspected but unconfirmed pulmonary embolism post-cesarean section. Differential diagnosis included venous thromboembolism, which was ruled out by imaging. P: The management plan includes close monitoring in the ICU with continuation of heparin infusion to manage the risk of thromboembolic events. Ongoing assessment of bleeding and constipation is necessary, with adjustments to treatment as needed. Further consultations with a hematologist for coagulation assessment and a gastroenterologist for severe constipation management are recommended. Patient education regarding signs of potential complications and the importance of follow-up care is crucial. Compliance with medication and post-operative care will be closely monitored to ensure a healthy recovery. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I understand you've presented with a history of sudden morning numbness in your right limbs, a headache, and vomiting. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. I also had tonic-clonic seizures and lost consciousness. Doctor: I see. On admission, you were somnolent and moderately dehydrated, with right hemiparesis and hemihypoesthesia. Did you notice any decrease in the warmth of your right limbs? Patient: Yes, they felt colder than usual. Doctor: Okay, we conducted a Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging and found symmetrical changes in postero-lateral thalami and medial occipital lobes, as well as smaller areas in the region of the splenium of the corpus callosum and within deep structures of the left cerebral hemisphere (Fig. a–d). We also performed a series of tests for metabolic, autoimmune, and rheumatoid diseases, as well as coagulopathies. None of these tests came back positive. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: After 7 days, your condition deteriorated and you became non-responsive. During a neuro-exam, we observed anisocoria R > L, right-sided central facial palsy, bilateral hemiparesis R > L, and a positive bilateral Babinski sign. We conducted another MR scan and found a new large hyperintense area in the pons and some smaller ones in the cerebellum (Fig. e, f). Patient: That sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it is concerning. A 3D-TOF angiography also showed an embolic mass within the basilar artery (BA) at the level of the left AICA and partial occlusion of P2a segments of both posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs) (Fig. ). Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: During a physical examination, we discovered a loss of your right radial pulse. A Doppler-US revealed normal flow values in the arteries of your right arm and forearm, but a complete occlusion of the right subclavian artery (SA) due to an embolic mass at the origin of the right vertebral artery (VA). The VA was partially occluded but had a tortuous canal of patency in its initial segment. Patient: Is that the cause of my symptoms? Doctor: It could be related. A chest X-Ray also revealed the presence of cervical ribs bilaterally (Fig. ). We then performed a CT-angiography of your subclavian arteries in two typical arm positions (Fig. ). This showed the occlusion of your right SA with a developed suprascapular. Patient: What's the next step, doctor? Doctor: We will need to consult with a specialist to determine the best course of action for your treatment. It's important that we address the occlusion and embolic mass to help alleviate your symptoms and prevent any further complications. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. We will keep you informed and involved in the decision-making process for your treatment. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. [/INST] S: The patient reports sudden onset of morning numbness in the right limbs, accompanied by headache, vomiting, tonic-clonic seizures, and loss of consciousness. The patient also noted decreased warmth in the right limbs. O: Initial examination showed the patient was somnolent, moderately dehydrated, with right hemiparesis and hemihypoesthesia. MR imaging revealed symmetrical changes in the postero-lateral thalami, medial occipital lobes, the splenium of the corpus callosum, and deep structures of the left cerebral hemisphere. Subsequent deterioration led to non-responsiveness, anisocoria R > L, right-sided central facial palsy, bilateral hemiparesis R > L, and a positive bilateral Babinski sign. Further MR imaging identified a new large hyperintense area in the pons and smaller areas in the cerebellum. 3D-TOF angiography showed an embolic mass in the basilar artery and partial occlusion of both posterior cerebral arteries. Doppler-US confirmed complete occlusion of the right subclavian artery with a tortuous canal of patency in the initial segment of the right vertebral artery. Chest X-Ray revealed bilateral cervical ribs. CT-angiography of the subclavian arteries showed occlusion of the right subclavian artery with a developed suprascapular artery. A: The patient presents with complex cerebrovascular and vascular pathology, including embolic occlusions in the basilar artery and right subclavian artery, which are likely contributing to the neurological deficits and symptoms observed. Differential diagnoses could include stroke, embolic events, and vascular malformations exacerbated by the presence of cervical ribs. P: The management plan will involve multidisciplinary consultation, including neurology and vascular surgery, to address the embolic occlusions and assess the need for surgical intervention or anticoagulation therapy. Continuous monitoring of neurological status and vascular integrity is essential. Patient education regarding the nature of the illness, potential complications, and the importance of follow-up care will be provided. Compliance with treatment and follow-up appointments will be emphasized to prevent further complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me how you've been feeling lately? Patient: Hi, I've had a headache for the past 6 months and I'm having trouble seeing on the right side of my vision. Doctor: I see. I understand you've been struggling at school as well? Patient: Yeah, it's been really hard to keep up with my studies. Doctor: Based on your MRI results, you have a suprasellar apoplectic tumor, and your prolactin level is quite high at 30,824 miU/L. We'll start you on a dopamine agonist and monitor you as an outpatient. Patient: Okay, thank you. Doctor: We'll also regularly check your visual field and prolactin levels to track your progress. After a year, please come back for a follow-up. Patient: Alright, I will. *After a year* Patient: Hi again, my vision seems to be getting worse. Doctor: I see, let's take a look at your recent MRI. It shows that your apoplectic tumor has enlarged, despite your prolactin level now being at 63 miU/L. We will need to perform an Endoscopic Transsphenoidal Surgery (ETSS) to prevent further visual loss. Patient: I understand. *After surgery* Doctor: Your surgery was successful. Both your vision and academic performance should return to normal. Patient: That's great to hear, thank you so much! Doctor: You're welcome. The histology report confirmed that your tumor was a prolactinoma with apoplexy. The Ki67 and p53 labelling were not elevated, which is a good sign. Patient: That's a relief. Thank you for all your help, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome! Just make sure to continue with your follow-up appointments and tests to monitor your progress. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to contact us. Patient: Will do. Thanks again! [/INST] S: The patient, a student, reported a persistent headache for the past 6 months and difficulty with right-sided vision, which has negatively impacted academic performance. The patient expressed concerns about worsening vision over the year. O: Initial MRI revealed a suprasellar apoplectic tumor. Prolactin levels were initially extremely elevated at 30,824 miU/L (normal range: 102-496 miU/L for males, 109-557 miU/L for females). Follow-up showed a significant reduction in prolactin levels to 63 miU/L after treatment with a dopamine agonist. However, a subsequent MRI indicated that the tumor had enlarged. Post-surgical MRI and histology confirmed successful removal of a prolactinoma with apoplexy, with normal Ki67 and p53 labeling. A: The primary diagnosis is a prolactinoma with apoplexy, which initially presented with significantly elevated prolactin levels and visual disturbances. The tumor's growth despite medical management necessitated surgical intervention. The prognosis is favorable post-surgery, given the successful tumor resection and normalization of prolactin levels. P: The patient underwent Endoscopic Transsphenoidal Surgery (ETSS) to address the tumor enlargement and prevent further visual impairment. Post-operative management includes regular monitoring of visual fields and prolactin levels. The patient is advised to continue follow-up appointments and tests to monitor progress and ensure no recurrence. Further educational support and adjustments are recommended to accommodate the patient's academic needs during recovery. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've presented to the accident and emergency department. Can you tell me what's been going on with your health lately? Patient: Yes, for the past year, I've been having shortness of breath and my fingers have turned blue. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Has your shortness of breath worsened over time? Patient: Yes, it started off only when I was doing stuff but now it's even when I'm at rest. It gets worse when I walk or sit but gets better when I lie flat or use oxygen therapy. Doctor: That must be quite limiting for you. Does it affect your daily activities, self-care, or sexual intercourse? Patient: Yes, it does. I can't do much of anything anymore. Doctor: I understand. You also mentioned the blue discoloration. Is it just on your hands, or other parts of your body as well? Patient: It's on my hands, feet, mouth, and nose. I've also had hand tremors, mainly during exercises. Doctor: Have you experienced any other symptoms, like headaches, chest pain, cough, or palpitations? Patient: I've had intermittent headaches that feel like pressure, but no chest pain, cough, or palpitations. And I haven't lost consciousness either. Doctor: What about any leg swelling, abdominal distension, pain, vomiting, jaundice, or changes in bowel or urine habits? Patient: No, none of those either. Doctor: Okay, I see in your history that you have chronic viral hepatitis C. Has it been treated? Patient: No, I didn't stick to the treatment. Doctor: Your social history shows that you used to smoke and drink alcohol, as well as use illicit drugs and share needles. Have you quit? Patient: Yes, I quit all of those about a year ago. Doctor: Good. Now, during your physical examination, we found peripheral and central cyanosis, grade 4 clubbing, muscle wasting, needle marks, palmar erythema, and bilateral resting tremor. Have you noticed any of these symptoms? Patient: Yes, I've noticed some of them, like the muscle wasting and tremor. Doctor: We also found scattered telangiectasia on your body. Your abdominal, cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological examinations were normal.  Patient: Okay. Doctor: The initial lab results show that you have a low platelet count of 104 × 109 per L, which is below the normal reference range of 150 – 400 × 109/L. Your white and red cell counts and hemoglobin levels are normal. We'll also check your coagulation profile. Patient: Thank you for letting me know. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your condition and discuss treatment options based on our findings. It's important to address the underlying cause of your symptoms. Please make sure to schedule follow-up appointments as needed. Patient: I will, thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient reports a year-long history of progressive shortness of breath, now present even at rest, and improved by lying flat or using oxygen therapy. The patient also describes peripheral cyanosis affecting hands, feet, mouth, and nose, along with hand tremors during exercise. The patient experiences intermittent pressure-like headaches but denies chest pain, cough, palpitations, loss of consciousness, leg swelling, abdominal distension, pain, vomiting, jaundice, or changes in bowel or urine habits. The patient has a history of untreated chronic viral hepatitis C and past substance abuse, including smoking, alcohol, and illicit drug use with needle sharing, all of which were ceased a year ago. O: Physical examination revealed peripheral and central cyanosis, grade 4 clubbing, muscle wasting, needle marks, palmar erythema, bilateral resting tremor, and scattered telangiectasia. Abdominal, cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological examinations were normal. Lab results showed a low platelet count of 104 × 10^9 per L (normal range: 150 – 400 × 10^9/L); white and red cell counts and hemoglobin levels were within normal limits. Coagulation profile pending. A: The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of advanced cardiopulmonary disease, possibly secondary to chronic hypoxia and/or pulmonary hypertension, which could be exacerbated by untreated chronic viral hepatitis C and a history of substance abuse. Differential diagnoses include heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, or a connective tissue disease. The presence of clubbing and cyanosis raises concerns for chronic hypoxia. P: Plan to monitor the patient's condition closely with scheduled follow-up appointments. Initiate referral to a cardiologist and pulmonologist for further evaluation and management of suspected pulmonary hypertension or other cardiopulmonary pathology. Consider restarting treatment for chronic viral hepatitis C and evaluate the need for supportive therapies such as supplemental oxygen. Educate the patient on the importance of adherence to treatment plans and scheduled follow-ups. Further testing, including echocardiography and possibly a right heart catheterization, may be necessary based on specialist consultations. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented here today with a history of low spirit, bad mood, suicide behaviors, and suspicion prior to hospitalization. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, for the past 4 weeks, I've been feeling really down and have had thoughts of suicide. I've also been suspicious of people around me. Doctor: I understand. Based on your symptoms, you were diagnosed with severe depression and received sertraline and olanzapine as treatment. How has that been working for you? Patient: It didn't really help. In fact, things got worse. My thinking became slower, and I even started having epileptic seizures after 7 days of treatment. Doctor: I see. We did a few tests to understand your condition better. Your CSF pressure was 240 cmH2O, and your leukocyte count was 10 × 106/L. We also found anti-NMDAR antibodies in your CSF and serum at a level of 1:32. Additionally, your initial electroencephalography (EEG) showed epileptic activity with sharp-slow waves in the right anterior frontotemporal region. We did a B-ultrasound and CT scan of your chest and abdomen to exclude any tumors.  Patient: Oh, okay. So what's the plan now? Doctor: We started you on a treatment plan that includes intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; 25 g/day, 5 days), methylprednisolone (1,000 mg, 3 days + 500 mg, 3 days), and prednisolone (0–60 mg, 12 weeks) for two courses. We also prescribed levetiracetam (1,500 mg, bid) and valproic acid (500 mg, bid) to help control your epilepsy. Patient: Did the treatment help with my other symptoms? Doctor: Unfortunately, you developed severe heart and respiratory failure, along with persistent psychiatric symptoms such as visual hallucination, auditory hallucination, and delusion. We tried treating you with olanzapine and aripiprazole, but your symptoms did not improve. In fact, you experienced aggressive behaviors on olanzapine and muscle stiffness and slurred speech on aripiprazole. Patient: That sounds terrible. Did anything help at all? Doctor: Yes, after stopping olanzapine and aripiprazole, we started you on clonazepam (2 mg, bid), and you showed clinical improvement. During your time in the intensive care unit (ICU), we sedated you with midazolam (2–4 mg/h, 45 days) to help manage your symptoms. Patient: I see. What's the plan going forward? Doctor: We'll be starting you on a new medication, quetiapine (50 mg/day to 0.4 g/day), to help manage your psychiatric symptoms. We'll closely monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything. I hope this new medication works better for me. [/INST] S: The patient, a 34-year-old male, reports persistent low spirit, bad mood, suicidal thoughts, and suspicion of others over the past 4 weeks. He has a history of severe depression and was previously treated with sertraline and olanzapine, which he reports were ineffective and led to worsening symptoms including slower thinking and the onset of epileptic seizures. O: The patient's CSF pressure was elevated at 240 cmH2O, and leukocyte count was normal at 10 × 10^6/L. Anti-NMDAR antibodies were detected in both CSF and serum at a titer of 1:32. Initial EEG indicated epileptic activity in the right anterior frontotemporal region. B-ultrasound and CT scans of the chest and abdomen were performed to rule out tumors. Current medications include intravenous immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, levetiracetam, and valproic acid. The patient developed severe heart and respiratory failure, along with persistent psychiatric symptoms including visual and auditory hallucinations and delusions. Previous treatments with olanzapine and aripiprazole were discontinued due to adverse effects including aggression, muscle stiffness, and slurred speech. A: Primary diagnosis is anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, evidenced by the presence of anti-NMDAR antibodies and corresponding clinical presentation. Differential diagnoses initially included severe depression and epilepsy, which are now considered secondary to the primary diagnosis. The prognosis is guarded due to the severity of symptoms and complications including heart and respiratory failure. P: The treatment plan includes continuation of immunosuppressive therapy and antiepileptic drugs. Introduction of quetiapine starting at 50 mg/day, with potential adjustments based on clinical response. The patient will be closely monitored in a medical setting, with adjustments to the treatment plan as necessary based on symptomatology and side effects. Further psychiatric evaluation and regular follow-ups will be scheduled to assess progress and manage any emerging issues. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm here to discuss your 14-month-old daughter's case regarding her neurodevelopmental delay and epilepsy. Can you tell me more about her symptoms? Patient: Hi doctor, she was having some developmental delays and infantile spasms. She was also born at the gestational age of 40 weeks with antecedents of gestational diabetes, and the delivery was by cesarean section. Doctor: Thank you for the information. We've done some tests including a high definition karyotype and the basic metabolic panel. Both of these tests came back normal. We also conducted an EEG, which showed slow waves, sharp waves, and spikes and waves discharges.  Patient: Oh, I see. What about the MRI results? Doctor: The MRI showed a Blake cyst in the posterior fossa, corpus callosum atrophy, and a hyperintense signal in the white matter of the semiovale centrum. This is related to the normal myelinisation process. We started her on a combination of valproic acid and vigabatrin to treat her epilepsy. Patient: Did the treatment work? Doctor: Yes, the combination of valproic acid and vigabatrin induced the remission of the seizures. However, she still has a mild neurodevelopmental delay. Patient: What about the genetic study? Did it show anything? Doctor: The genetic study showed a 207-base deletion due to transcription problems in the EN2 exon 2 (C9 marker) in the region of bases 2976-3182. She also showed a 504-base deletion in the LIS1 marker region of PAFAH1B1 (from 729 to 1232 bases) and a 206-base deletion in the HLIS1 marker of LIS1[PAFAH1B1] coding region 4240-4562 (from 4357 to 4562 bases). No alterations were found in genes PTAFR, PAFAH1B2, PAFAH1B3, FGF8, and PAX2. Patient: What does this mean for her? Doctor: These genetic findings could be contributing to her neurodevelopmental delay and epilepsy. We'll continue to monitor her progress and adjust her treatment as needed. It's essential to keep a close eye on her development and report any new symptoms or concerns. Patient: Thank you, doctor. We'll make sure to follow up and keep you updated on her condition. [/INST] S: The patient's mother reports that her 14-month-old daughter has developmental delays and infantile spasms. The child was born at full term with a history of gestational diabetes, delivered via cesarean section. O: Recent medical tests include a high definition karyotype and basic metabolic panel, both of which returned normal results. An EEG revealed slow waves, sharp waves, and spikes and waves discharges. MRI findings include a Blake cyst in the posterior fossa, corpus callosum atrophy, and a hyperintense signal in the white matter of the semiovale centrum, attributed to normal myelination. Genetic studies identified a 207-base deletion in EN2 exon 2, a 504-base deletion in LIS1, and a 206-base deletion in HLIS1. The child is currently on a combination of valproic acid and vigabatrin, which has successfully induced remission of seizures. A: The primary diagnosis is neurodevelopmental delay and epilepsy, with genetic abnormalities likely contributing to the condition. The imaging and EEG findings support the diagnosis of a complex neurological condition. P: Continue the current regimen of valproic acid and vigabatrin to manage epilepsy. Regular follow-up appointments will be necessary to monitor the child's development and adjust treatment as needed. Genetic counseling may be beneficial to the family to discuss the implications of the genetic findings and potential future considerations. Further assessments by a pediatric neurologist and a developmental specialist are recommended to address and support the child's developmental needs. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you were admitted to our hospital with obstructive jaundice and anorexia. Can you tell me more about your medical history? Patient: Hmm, I worked at a printing company for 18 years, and there was an outbreak of cholangiocarcinoma there. I was exposed to high concentrations of DCP and DCM for 6 years during my employment. Doctor: I see. Have you had any recent medical examinations? Patient: Yeah, six months ago, they detected elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity during a regular medical examination. Doctor: Do you have any history of alcohol consumption? Patient: Yes, I used to consume alcohol heavily. Doctor: Thank you for the information. We have conducted some laboratory tests, and the results show elevated serum total bilirubin concentration (10.7 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (76 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (226 U/L), and γ-GTP (319 U/L). Your carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels are within the reference range (2.0 ng/mL), but carcinoembryonic antigen and s-pancreas-1 antigen are elevated (17.9 ng/mL and 103.7 U/mL, respectively). Patient: Oh, that sounds bad. Doctor: We also performed a dynamic abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. It showed dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts with common bile duct obstruction owing to a tumor. This tumor is suspected to be an enlarged lymph node (maximum diameter, 45 mm) originating in the hepatoduodenal ligament or peripancreatic region (the bulky lymph node) and invading the common bile duct and pancreatic head. There are also enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes present. Patient: What does this mean for me? Doctor: Although the intrahepatic bile ducts are entirely dilated, we identified a cystic dilatation of the intraductal tumor, suspected as an intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB), in the proximal side of the biliary branch in segment 2 (B2) through CT and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Patient: So, what's the diagnosis? Doctor: We also performed biliary cytology with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and adenocarcinoma cells were detected. Based on all these findings, the diagnosis is cholangiocarcinoma as invasive IPNB with extensive lymph node metastases. Patient: What's the next step for my treatment? Doctor: Your case will be discussed with our multidisciplinary team to determine the best course of treatment. We will keep you and your family informed about the progress and any decisions made. [/INST] S: The patient, a former printing company employee with a history of exposure to high concentrations of DCP and DCM, presents with obstructive jaundice and anorexia. He reports a medical history of elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity and heavy alcohol consumption.  O: Laboratory tests reveal elevated serum total bilirubin (10.7 mg/dL), AST (76 U/L), ALT (226 U/L), and γ-GTP (319 U/L). Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels are normal (2.0 ng/mL), but carcinoembryonic antigen and s-pancreas-1 antigen are elevated (17.9 ng/mL and 103.7 U/mL, respectively). Dynamic abdominal CT and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography show dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts, common bile duct obstruction by a tumor suspected to be an enlarged lymph node (45 mm diameter), and enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes. A cystic dilatation of the intraductal tumor, suspected as intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB), is identified in segment 2 (B2). Biliary cytology with ERCP detected adenocarcinoma cells. A: The primary diagnosis is cholangiocarcinoma, classified as invasive IPNB with extensive lymph node metastases. Differential diagnoses were considered based on imaging and lab results but were ruled out by cytology and tumor markers. P: The patient's case will be discussed in a multidisciplinary team meeting to determine the optimal treatment strategy. The plan will include informing the patient and his family about the progress and decisions regarding his treatment. Further consultations with oncology, surgery, and possibly palliative care will be arranged as needed. Compliance with the treatment plan and follow-up will be emphasized to manage and monitor the progression of the disease. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, I understand you have a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, as well as a family history of breast cancer in your brother and maternal aunt. What brings you in today? Patient: I've been having recurrent chest pain and have felt really fatigued for the past few months.  Doctor: I see. Have you been evaluated for any other conditions recently? Patient: Yeah, my primary care physician has been looking into my worsening anemia. Doctor: Okay, let's take a look at your test results. Your hemoglobin was at 6 gm/dl, and your iron panel is consistent with anemia of chronic disease. We also have your electrocardiogram (ECG) results, which show an ""RSR pattern"" in V1 and V2 leads but were otherwise normal. We did a stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) test to check for cardiac ischemia, and it came back negative. Patient: So, what does all that mean? Doctor: The ECG pattern and negative MPI results are good news, as they indicate that your chest pain is not due to a blocked artery. However, we did find something concerning on your transthoracic echocardiogram. There's a 1.6 cm x 1.5 cm mass attached to the anterior wall of your left atrium, which appears to cross the mitral valve in ventricular diastole. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What did you do next? Doctor: We further examined the mass with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). It showed an irregularly shaped, partly mobile mass attached to the atrial septum and extending to the anterior mitral valve leaflet. The segment attached to the septum measured 2.6 cm x 1.43 cm, and the segment attached to the valve measured 1.4 cm x 2.22 cm. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: We also did an MRI of your heart with gadolinium to get a better look at the mass. It confirmed the presence of a circumscribed hypodense mass with a speckled appearance, which originated at the atrial septum and extended along the anterior mitral valve leaflet. Fortunately, the mitral valve flow was normal, with no evidence of obstruction, stenosis, or regurgitation. Patient: So, what's the plan now? Doctor: Based on the location and appearance of the mass, we thought it could be a myxoma. We decided to proceed with a minimal incision valve surgery to resect the mass. Intraoperatively, upon examination of your left atrium, we found that the mass originated from the fossa ovalis region of the interatrial septum and infiltrated the atrial wall down onto the entire anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. We also noticed a fibrotic density surrounding the tumor. Patient: Wow, that's a lot to take in. How did the surgery go? Doctor: The surgery went well. We removed the mass along with a portion of the interatrial septum and the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. We will continue to monitor your recovery and follow up on your other health conditions, like your anemia. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all your help and explanation. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you through this. [/INST] S: The patient reports recurrent chest pain and significant fatigue over the past few months. They have a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and worsening anemia. Family history includes breast cancer in a brother and maternal aunt. O: Hemoglobin measured at 6 gm/dl, indicating severe anemia. Iron panel consistent with anemia of chronic disease. ECG shows an ""RSR pattern"" in V1 and V2 leads but is otherwise normal. Stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) was negative for cardiac ischemia. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a 1.6 cm x 1.5 cm mass on the anterior wall of the left atrium, crossing the mitral valve in ventricular diastole. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed an irregularly shaped, partly mobile mass on the atrial septum and anterior mitral valve leaflet. MRI confirmed a circumscribed hypodense mass with a speckled appearance, originating at the atrial septum and extending along the anterior mitral valve leaflet, with normal mitral valve flow. A: Primary diagnosis of cardiac myxoma based on imaging and intraoperative findings, with differential diagnoses including other cardiac tumors. Complications could have included obstruction of mitral valve flow, but this was not observed. Prognosis is cautiously optimistic post-surgery, pending recovery and ongoing management of anemia and other chronic conditions. P: The patient underwent minimal incision valve surgery to resect the cardiac mass, with removal of part of the interatrial septum and the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Postoperative plan includes close monitoring of recovery and management of anemia and other pre-existing conditions.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I understand you had a primary molar (tooth 75) extracted back in June 2010 for orthodontic reasons. Can you tell me about any symptoms you experienced after the extraction? Patient: Yeah, I developed some pain and swelling that lasted for a while. Doctor: After that prolonged period of pain and swelling, you were referred to a specialist in oral and maxillofacial surgery at Växjö County Hospital, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Based on your symptoms, radiographic images, and a biopsy, you were diagnosed with acute osteomyelitis with periosteal activity in November 2010. You were then treated with clindamycin for the acute osteomyelitis. Do you recall that? Patient: Yes, I remember. Doctor: So, six months later, your clinical and radiographic signs showed diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis. There were no other signs of odontogenic infection, temporomandibular disorder, or impacted wisdom teeth in need of extraction that could explain your symptoms. You were then referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at Skåne University Hospital, Lund, for further diagnosis and treatment. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: You were then treated for five years with corticosteroid and NSAID, but unfortunately, you didn't experience satisfactory pain relief. At that point, other treatment options were discussed, and denosumab was considered due to its shorter half-life compared to bisphosphonate. You were informed of the risk of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) that could be initiated by denosumab. Do you remember discussing this? Patient: Yes, I do. Doctor: In February 2014, you received a subcutaneous injection of 120 mg denosumab. How did you feel after the injection? Patient: Just three days after the injection, I was completely pain-free and didn't need any other pain relief medication. Doctor: That's great to hear. So, during the first three months, you were given 120 mg of denosumab every month. After the initial treatment, the pain started again six months later, but with less intensity. You were given another 120 mg injection of denosumab in May 2015. How did you feel after that? Patient: Three or four days after the injection, I was pain-free again, and it lasted for another five months. Doctor: That's good to know. In October 2015, you received the latest injection of denosumab with the same successful results as before. How have you been feeling since then? Patient: I've been feeling much better, thanks to the treatment. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. Please continue to keep us updated on your progress and reach out if you experience any changes in your symptoms or have any concerns. We're here to help. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient reported initial pain and swelling following the extraction of tooth 75 in June 2010, which was performed for orthodontic reasons. The symptoms persisted, leading to a diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis with periosteal activity in November 2010. Despite treatment with clindamycin and later corticosteroids and NSAIDs, the patient experienced unsatisfactory pain relief. The patient recalls discussions about the risks of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) associated with denosumab treatment. O: The patient was diagnosed with diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis six months post initial symptoms, with no other odontogenic infections or conditions like temporomandibular disorder or impacted wisdom teeth. Initial treatment included clindamycin, followed by long-term corticosteroids and NSAIDs. Subsequent treatment with denosumab (120 mg subcutaneous injections) led to significant pain relief within days of administration. The latest follow-up in October 2015 showed successful pain management with denosumab. A: The primary diagnosis is diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis, initially treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications, which were later switched to denosumab due to inadequate pain control. The patient responded well to denosumab, with rapid and sustained pain relief following each injection. P: Continue monitoring the patient's response to denosumab and assess for any signs of MRONJ or other side effects. Schedule regular follow-ups every six months to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and make adjustments as necessary. Educate the patient on the importance of reporting any new symptoms or concerns, particularly related to jaw pain or dental health, given the risks associated with osteonecrosis. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that you have a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, atherosclerosis obliterans, and spinal canal stenosis. You were referred to our hospital for the treatment of AS. Can you tell me more about your medical background? Patient: Yes, I had undergone living-donor kidney transplantation 13 years ago and have been taking immunosuppressant agents since then. Before the transplant, I was on hemodialysis for 15 years. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We decided to perform TAVI to treat your severe AS due to your medical history. During the preoperative examination for AS, a CT scan showed an abnormal shadow in the right lower lobe. At that time, we suspected it to be an inflammatory nodule, so we planned to follow up on this abnormal shadow through CT. How did the TAVI procedure go? Patient: The TAVI was performed successfully, and I didn't have any postoperative complications. Doctor: That's great to hear. However, the shadow in your right lower lobe enlarged, and lung cancer was suspected. We performed a transbronchial lung biopsy, and the pathologic examination revealed adenocarcinoma. The clinical stage was stage IB. In light of this, we planned to proceed with surgery.  Patient: Okay, so what's the plan for the surgery? Doctor: We performed a right lower lobectomy 9 months after your TAVI. Perioperative heparin bridging was done for the low-dose aspirin therapy you had been taking. Since there was severe diffuse adhesion of the entire surface of the lung and right chest cavity, probably due to pleuritis, thoracotomy was needed. The surgery was carried out without complications. Patient: I see. What was the final diagnosis after the surgery? Doctor: The pathologic diagnosis was squamous carcinoma, pT1bN0M0 stage IB. You had an uneventful postoperative course. Patient: That's a relief. How am I doing now, several months after the surgery? Doctor: Eight months after the surgery, you are doing well without any recurrence. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate all the care and attention I received during this entire process. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, atherosclerosis obliterans, and spinal canal stenosis, underwent a living-donor kidney transplantation 13 years ago and has been on immunosuppressant therapy since. The patient was referred for treatment of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and reported successful Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) without postoperative complications. However, a follow-up for an abnormal shadow in the right lower lobe initially suspected as an inflammatory nodule revealed adenocarcinoma, later diagnosed as squamous carcinoma post-surgery. O: Preoperative CT for AS showed an abnormal shadow in the right lower lobe, suspected to be inflammatory. Post-TAVI, the shadow enlarged, leading to a suspicion of lung cancer. Transbronchial lung biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma, clinical stage IB. Right lower lobectomy was performed, with perioperative heparin bridging for ongoing low-dose aspirin therapy. Pathologic examination post-surgery confirmed squamous carcinoma, pT1bN0M0, stage IB. Eight months post-surgery, the patient shows no signs of recurrence. A: Primary diagnosis is squamous carcinoma of the lung, stage IB, post successful treatment of severe AS with TAVI. Differential diagnosis initially included adenocarcinoma based on biopsy but was later revised post-surgical pathology. The prognosis is currently favorable with no evidence of recurrence. P: Continue regular follow-up with oncology to monitor for any signs of recurrence of lung cancer. Maintain current immunosuppressant regimen and manage other comorbid conditions like hypertension and chronic renal failure with appropriate medications and monitoring. Educate the patient on signs of recurrence or complications and ensure adherence to follow-up schedules. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been having some issues with my left eye. Doctor: What kind of issues have you been experiencing? Patient: I'm not sure, but I feel like there's something wrong with my vision. Doctor: Let's perform some tests to determine what's going on. We'll start with an SD-OCT scan. (After conducting the SD-OCT scan) Doctor: The results show that you have a vitreomacular traction (VMT) in your left eye. You also have an epiretinal membrane (ERM) on the OCT scan. For now, we'll follow a watchful waiting approach for 2 months and see if there's any change. (After 84 days) Patient: My vision seems to be getting worse, doctor. Doctor: Let's check your eye again. Your best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) has decreased to 0.25, foveal thickness is now 580 μm, and the extent of adhesion has increased to 803 μm. I recommend you undergo an intravitreal injection of 0.3 ml 100% C3F8 gas to address the issue. Patient: Okay, if you think that's best. (A week after the procedure) Doctor: How is your eye feeling now? Patient: I don't feel any release of traction, doctor. Doctor: Let's examine your eye again. It looks like there is still no release of traction. I'll need to see you again in 3 weeks for a follow-up. (At the 3-week follow-up) Patient: Doctor, I've started to notice a black shadow in my vision. Doctor: I see that your BCVA has increased to 0.4, but there's still no release of traction and your foveal thickness has increased to 816 μm. There's also a retinal tear with retinal detachment in the periphery at the 6 o'clock position. We'll need to perform a vitrectomy with gas to fix this. Patient: Alright, let's do whatever is necessary to fix my eye. (After the vitrectomy) Doctor: The surgery went well, and the retina is now reattached. Your vision should remain stable at the current outcome. Patient: Thank you, doctor, for taking care of my eye. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: Patient reports issues with left eye, initially presenting with concerns about vision quality. Over time, symptoms progressed with worsening vision and the appearance of a black shadow. O: Initial SD-OCT scan revealed vitreomacular traction (VMT) and an epiretinal membrane (ERM) in the left eye. Follow-up examinations showed a decrease in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from normal to 0.25, with foveal thickness increasing from normal to 580 μm and then to 816 μm. An intravitreal injection of 0.3 ml 100% C3F8 gas was administered without release of traction. Subsequent examination identified a retinal tear with detachment at the 6 o'clock position. Post-vitrectomy, the retina was successfully reattached, and BCVA improved to 0.4. A: Primary diagnosis of vitreomacular traction (VMT) with complications including epiretinal membrane (ERM), retinal tear, and detachment. Differential diagnosis initially considered could have included other causes of visual impairment such as macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy, but findings supported the primary diagnosis. P: Initial management included watchful waiting followed by intravitreal gas injection, which did not resolve the traction. Progression led to surgical intervention with vitrectomy and gas for retinal detachment. Post-operative plan includes regular follow-ups to monitor stability of the retina and BCVA, with potential for additional interventions if new symptoms or complications arise. Patient education on signs of further retinal issues and ensuring adherence to follow-up appointments is crucial. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, how have you been feeling lately? Patient: Well, I've been experiencing shortness of breath and pain during mild exercise. Doctor: I see. Considering your history of HHT and haemoptysis, along with the three previous PAVM embolizations, I'd like to look into this further. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Sure, when I'm resting, I feel okay, but during exercise, my breathing gets more difficult and the pain comes in. Doctor: Alright. We recently conducted a saturation test, and it showed that your saturation at rest was 92% and decreased to 89% during exercise. We also performed a CE test that confirmed a shunt grade of I-II. A CT without contrast was conducted, which showed two new PAVMs. Patient: Oh no, what does that mean? Doctor: Don't worry, we've already taken care of it. We catheterized your right pulmonary artery and performed angiography, which depicted the two PAVMs, one in your right upper lobe and one in your right lower lobe. Both PAVMs had feeding arteries with a diameter of 3.2 mm. Patient: What did you do for the treatment? Doctor: The PAVM in the lower lobe was embolized with a detachable coil, 6 mm in diameter and 10 cm long from Boston Scientific. The PAVM in the upper lobe was engaged coaxially with a 2.8 Fr microcatheter and primarily embolized with an MVP-5Q device from Reverse Medical Corporation, resulting in immediate occlusion. Patient: Were there any complications during the intervention? Doctor: No, there were no complications during the intervention. You were discharged the next day, and we've been monitoring your progress since then. Patient: That's a relief. How am I doing now? Doctor: Your follow-up clinical and CE control showed improved oxygenation up to 96% and no shunt at the six-month CE control. So, everything looks good! Patient: That's great to hear! Thanks for taking care of me, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome! Remember to keep monitoring your symptoms and reach out if anything changes. Take care! [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing shortness of breath and pain during mild exercise, which worsens with activity. The patient feels okay at rest. There is a history of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), haemoptysis, and three previous pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) embolizations. O: Recent tests showed a saturation of 92% at rest, decreasing to 89% during exercise. Contrast echocardiography (CE) confirmed a shunt grade of I-II. CT imaging without contrast revealed two new PAVMs in the right pulmonary artery, specifically in the right upper and lower lobes. The PAVMs had feeding arteries with a diameter of 3.2 mm. Interventional treatment included embolization of the lower lobe PAVM with a 6 mm x 10 cm detachable coil and the upper lobe PAVM with an MVP-5Q device, resulting in immediate occlusion. Post-procedure, the patient's oxygenation improved to 96% with no shunt observed at the six-month follow-up. A: The primary diagnosis is recurrent pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) associated with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). The successful embolization of the new PAVMs has led to improved clinical outcomes, including increased oxygen saturation and resolution of the shunt. No complications were reported post-intervention. P: Continue regular follow-up to monitor for potential recurrence of PAVMs or the emergence of new symptoms. Educate the patient on recognizing signs of decreased oxygenation or new respiratory issues. Encourage adherence to scheduled follow-up appointments and CE controls to ensure early detection and management of potential complications. Advise the patient to maintain a healthy lifestyle and avoid strenuous activities that could exacerbate symptoms. </s>"

And you're a nonsmoker, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: You initially presented with a week-long watery nonbloody diarrhea, diffuse crampy abdominal pain, and generalized weakness. There was no fever nor vomiting, right? Patient: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: You were admitted to a provincial hospital for a week and given an unrecalled antibiotic, which led to the resolution of your symptoms. However, upon discharge, you experienced severe right lower quadrant pain radiating to the back and left lower quadrant for two weeks. There was no history of diarrhea, vomiting, dysuria, and fever during that time, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: You were readmitted to the provincial hospital, and diagnostics revealed anemia and a urinary tract infection. You were given packed red blood cell units and unrecalled intravenous antibiotics, respectively. Blood cultures were initially negative. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, I remember that. Doctor: Abdominal imaging showed bilateral renal parenchymal disease and an infrarenal aortic aneurysm. Appendicitis was ruled out by symptomatology and imaging. You were then transferred to our institution for surgical repair of the aneurysm. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's why I'm here. Doctor: During your admission at the surgical ward, we've titrated your antihypertensive medications to keep your blood pressures less than 120/80.

Patient: No, I don't have any prior psychiatric history. Doctor: Okay. I was informed that emergency medical services brought you in at the request of your mother due to your increased aggression and paranoia at home. Can you tell me more about that? Patient: Yeah, it started a couple of months ago when I left home to stay with my boyfriend. I felt like people were trying to kill me, and I even attacked my mom when she was driving. I also started accusing my family members of being replacements, like in Capgras syndrome. Doctor: That must have been distressing for you and your family. Your mother also mentioned that you've been intrusive towards strangers on the street, reading the Bible, and getting in people's faces. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's true. I've been doing that. Doctor: When you were presented to the hospital, you seemed very confused, internally preoccupied, disorganized, and providing delayed and inappropriate responses to questions. Was this your first psychiatric presentation? Patient: Yes, it was my first time. Doctor: I also noticed that you have an elongated face with small ears rotated backward and exhibit hypernasal speech. Additionally, you appeared to be labile, crying for no apparent reason and then later singing out loud. Can you tell me more about these behaviors? Patient: I don't know, it's just how I've been acting lately. I can't really explain it. Doctor: I see. The patient refused to come out of her room for an initial interview. During the interview, you remained evasive and guarded. Your thought process seemed illogical, and your thought content was delusional. For example, you thought your mother was the devil. Can you tell me more about these thoughts? Patient: It's hard to explain, but I just feel like she's not who she says she is. I also hear Jesus's voice telling me everything's going to be okay. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. You mentioned hearing Jesus's voice, but you denied experiencing visual, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory hallucinations. Have you had any thoughts of suicide or homicide? Patient: No, I haven't had any suicidal or homicidal thoughts. Doctor: I appreciate your honesty. Lastly, you admitted to using illicit drugs in the past, such as marijuana, Ecstasy, Molly, and alcohol. Can you tell me more about your drug use? Patient: Yeah, I've tried those drugs before, but I can't remember the last time I used them. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We will continue to monitor your condition and work on a treatment plan to help you manage these symptoms. It's important to be honest about your experiences so we can provide the best possible care for you. [/INST] S: The patient is a 21-year-old African American female with no prior psychiatric history, presenting with increased aggression, paranoia, and delusional behavior. Symptoms began a few months ago, characterized by a belief that people were trying to harm her and accusatory behavior towards family members, resembling Capgras syndrome. She also exhibited intrusive behavior towards strangers and religious preoccupation. The patient reported auditory hallucinations of Jesus's voice but denied visual, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory hallucinations. She denied suicidal or homicidal ideations. Past drug use includes marijuana, Ecstasy, Molly, and alcohol, though the timing of last use is unclear. O: Upon examination, the patient appeared confused, internally preoccupied, and disorganized with delayed and inappropriate responses. Physical features noted included an elongated face, small backward-rotated ears, and hypernasal speech. Emotional lability was observed, with episodes of unexplained crying and singing. The patient was evasive, guarded, and displayed illogical thought processes with delusional content, specifically thinking her mother was the devil. A: The primary diagnosis is a psychotic disorder, possibly schizophrenia or a drug-induced psychosis, considering the patient's drug history and symptomatology. Differential diagnoses include bipolar disorder with psychotic features and schizoaffective disorder. The presence of physical anomalies may suggest a genetic syndrome that could be contributing to her psychiatric presentation. P: The management plan will include psychiatric evaluation, antipsychotic medication, and monitoring for response and side effects. A drug screen will be conducted to assess recent drug use. Referral to a geneticist is recommended to evaluate for any underlying genetic conditions.

Patient: Yeah, for the past week, I've been experiencing exertional shortness of breath, and it's been getting worse. Doctor: I see. Have you had any other symptoms recently? Patient: Actually, yes. About 4 days ago, I started having some swelling and pain in my right lower leg. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Have you had any chest pain, palpitations, recent weight loss, history of personal or family blood clots, miscarriages, or recent travel? Patient: No, I haven't experienced any of those. Doctor: What medications are you currently taking? Patient: I'm just taking an oral contraceptive pill for my menorrhagia. Doctor: Alright. Based on your symptoms and history, we've performed some tests. Currently, you're hypoxic, which means we need to provide you with 2 liters of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain your oxygen saturation above 90%. Your respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and you're mildly tachycardic with a heart rate of 108 bpm. Your blood pressure is 144/90, and your temperature is 36.6°C. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We also performed a physical examination, which showed morbid obesity and right lower extremity swelling. However, there were no signs of phlegmasia cerulea dolens. Your Troponin I levels were normal, but your BNP was elevated at 704 pg/ml, with the reference range being 0-100 pg/ml. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: We also conducted a 12 lead ECG, which showed a sinus rhythm of 95 bpm with an S1Q3T3 pattern. Your chest X-ray was unremarkable. Based on these findings, we calculated your Wells' score to be 7.5, which indicates a high chance of pulmonary embolism (PE). Patient: Oh no, what do we do now? Doctor: We performed a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) to confirm our suspicion. It demonstrated a saddle-type pulmonary embolus with extension into multiple segmental and subsegmental branches in the bilateral upper and bilateral lower lobes, along with right ventricular (RV) strain. Your RV end-diastolic diameter was increased, with an RV to left ventricular (LV) diameter ratio greater than 1. There was also mild dilatation of your main pulmonary artery at 35mm, with the normal range being less than 29mm. Patient: That sounds serious. What's the plan? Doctor: We will start you on appropriate treatment for your pulmonary embolism and closely monitor your condition. We'll also address your heart strain and other associated issues. It's important that you follow up with your primary care doctor and any specialists as needed. We will provide further instructions and recommendations before you leave the hospital. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. I'll make sure to follow up with my doctors. [/INST] S: The patient, a female with a history of asthma, obesity, and menorrhagia, presented with a chief complaint of exertional shortness of breath worsening over the past week. She also reported recent onset of swelling and pain in her right lower leg starting four days ago. She denies chest pain, palpitations, recent weight loss, personal or family history of blood clots, miscarriages, or recent travel. She is currently taking an oral contraceptive pill for menorrhagia. O: On examination, the patient was hypoxic, requiring 2 liters of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. Her respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, heart rate was mildly tachycardic at 108 bpm, blood pressure was 144/90, and temperature was 36.6°C. Physical examination revealed morbid obesity and right lower extremity swelling, but no signs of phlegmasia cerulea dolens. Laboratory tests showed normal Troponin I levels and elevated BNP at 704 pg/ml (normal 0-100 pg/ml). A 12-lead ECG showed a sinus rhythm of 95 bpm with an S1Q3T3 pattern. Chest X-ray was unremarkable. Wells' score calculated at 7.5, indicating a high probability of pulmonary embolism. CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed a saddle-type pulmonary embolus with extension into multiple segmental and subsegmental branches in bilateral upper and lower lobes, and right ventricular strain with RV end-diastolic diameter increased and RV to LV diameter ratio greater than 1. Mild dilatation of the main pulmonary artery at 35mm was noted. A: The primary diagnosis is acute pulmonary embolism with right ventricular strain. Differential diagnoses considered included deep vein thrombosis and other causes of dyspnea, but these were less likely given the imaging and clinical findings. P: Initiate anticoagulation therapy immediately to manage the pulmonary embolism. Monitor vital signs and oxygen saturation closely. Consider consultation with a cardiologist due to right ventricular strain. Educate the patient on the importance of adherence to the treatment plan and the need for regular follow-up with her primary care physician and possibly a pulmonologist. Discuss potential modifications to her oral contraceptive therapy considering the PE diagnosis. Provide discharge instructions that emphasize signs of worsening symptoms and when to seek immediate medical attention. </s>"

Doctor: You were referred to me for treatment of ICD-10 F41.2 mixed anxiety and depressive disorder. You also have symptoms of anorexia nervosa. Have you been treated for these issues before? Patient: Yeah, I was treated in a private adolescent psychiatric clinic for my anorexia nervosa. Doctor: I understand you come from a relatively stable family. Your father is a physician and your mother is a dentist, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: It seems like you've always been good at school and finishing your duties at home. Your parents encouraged you to play the piano and excel at horse riding competitions, didn't they? Patient: Yeah, they always wanted me to do well in those activities. Doctor: I noticed that your father didn't respond positively when you performed very well but showed disappointment if you didn't get an A in exams. Can you tell me more about that? Patient: Yeah, he just expected me to always do my best, and anything less than an A wasn't good enough. Doctor: It seems that when you were 13, you discovered your father having an affair. Did this event have a significant impact on your life? Patient: Yes, it really affected me. I started overperforming in school and sports while gradually developing an eating disorder. Doctor: I see. So, you started restricting food, which led to abnormally low weight. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, exactly. Doctor: Despite these issues, you managed to maintain satisfying relationships with your friends, your mother, and siblings. Is that still the case? Patient: Yes, I still have good relationships with them. Doctor: Your clinical presentation is primarily classified as Anorexia Nervosa in the context of Personality Difficulty. This means you have some long-standing difficulties in your way of thinking about yourself and the world. These difficulties are insufficiently severe to cause notable disruption in school and most relationships. Does that sound accurate? Patient: Yeah, I guess so. Doctor: You also have prominent features of Negative Affectivity, such as depressivity, shame, and anxiety, as well as Anankastia, which includes perfectionism, concern with meeting obligations, perseveration, deliberativeness, and tight control of your emotional expression. Can you relate to these descriptions? Patient: Yeah, that sounds a lot like me. Doctor: Thank you for sharing this information with me. We'll work together to develop a treatment plan to address your anxiety, depressive disorder, and anorexia nervosa symptoms. It's important to keep an open line of communication so we can make any necessary adjustments as we move forward. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'm looking forward to working with you on this. [/INST] S: The patient, a 19-year-old high school student, presents with symptoms of mixed anxiety and depressive disorder (ICD-10 F41.2) and anorexia nervosa. The patient has a history of treatment for anorexia nervosa at a private adolescent psychiatric clinic. The patient reports a family history of high achievement expectations, particularly from the father, and a significant life event at age 13 involving the discovery of the father's affair, which precipitated the onset of the eating disorder. The patient maintains good relationships with friends, mother, and siblings despite these issues. O: The patient's clinical presentation includes primary classification as Anorexia Nervosa in the context of Personality Difficulty, with prominent features of Negative Affectivity (depressivity, shame, anxiety) and Anankastia (perfectionism, concern with obligations, perseveration, deliberativeness, tight control of emotional expression). No specific vital signs, lab results, or imaging findings are provided in the dialogue. A: The primary diagnosis is Anorexia Nervosa with co-morbid Mixed Anxiety and Depressive Disorder. The patient's personality features and family dynamics contribute to the complexity of the case. The prognosis depends on the effectiveness of the treatment plan and the patient's adherence to it, considering the chronic nature of the disorders. P: The treatment plan will focus on addressing the symptoms of anxiety, depressive disorder, and anorexia nervosa. This will likely include a combination of psychotherapy, possibly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and pharmacotherapy if necessary. Regular follow-ups will be scheduled to monitor progress and make adjustments to the treatment plan. The patient will be encouraged to maintain open communication to facilitate adjustments in therapy. Referral to a nutritionist and continued psychiatric support will be essential components of the comprehensive care plan. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Good morning! How can I help you today? Patient: Good morning, doctor. I'm 42 years old and I've been having trouble with my bite. It's an anterior open bite and has been affecting my ability to chew properly. I also feel pain in my TMJ when I chew and open my mouth. Doctor: I see. Has this issue worsened over time? Patient: Yes, it has been gradually getting worse. I also have this tongue thrust issue. Doctor: Okay. Have you consulted any other specialists about this problem? Patient: Yes, I went to an orthodontist who recommended orthodontic treatment with orthognathic surgery, but I'm not keen on undergoing surgery. Doctor: I understand your concerns. Let's take a closer look at your condition. I'd like to examine your facial appearance and take some intraoral photographs.  Patient: Sure, go ahead. Doctor: Based on your pretreatment facial appearance, I can see a convex profile and hypermentalis activity when you close your lips. The intraoral photographs show a -6.0-mm anterior open bite with occlusal contact only between your second molars. Your right molar occlusal relationship is class II, and the left one is a more severe type of class II. There's crowding in both arches, and your upper dental midline has shifted to the right by 4 mm. Your lower midline, however, coincides with your facial midline. Patient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We also took a panoramic radiograph which revealed the existence of three third molars, except for your upper right third molar. The cephalometric measurements show a severe skeletal class II relationship with an ANB angle of 11.5° and a steep FMA of 47.5°. Your upper incisors have a lingual inclination with a U1-FH angle of 104.6°. Patient: What does that mean, doctor? Doctor: These measurements indicate that you have a severe skeletal class II open bite with TMD. We also conducted an MRI of both TMJs, which showed evidence of DDwoR. Schüller’s view revealed flattening of both condyles but no restriction of jaw movement. Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: I'd like to propose a non-surgical approach to address your TMJ pain. We can use a stabilization occlusal splint before starting orthodontic treatment. This should help reduce the pain in your TMJ. Patient: That sounds like a better option for me. Doctor: Great. We'll need your informed consent before proceeding with the treatment plan. Remember that it's important to follow up with us regularly to monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments. Patient: Of course, doctor. Thank you for explaining everything to me. I appreciate it. Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help. [/INST] S: The 42-year-old patient reports a progressively worsening anterior open bite, affecting chewing and causing pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The patient also mentions a tongue thrust issue and expresses reluctance to undergo recommended orthognathic surgery. O: Examination reveals a convex facial profile and hypermentalis activity. Intraoral photographs indicate a -6.0-mm anterior open bite with occlusal contact limited to the second molars. The right molar occlusal relationship is class II, with a more severe class II on the left. There is crowding in both arches, and the upper dental midline is shifted right by 4 mm, while the lower midline aligns with the facial midline. Panoramic radiograph shows absence of the upper right third molar and presence of other third molars. Cephalometric measurements indicate a severe skeletal class II relationship with an ANB angle of 11.5° and a steep FMA of 47.5°. The upper incisors are lingually inclined (U1-FH angle of 104.6°). MRI of both TMJs shows evidence of disc displacement without reduction (DDwoR), and Schüller’s view reveals flattening of both condyles without movement restriction. A: The primary diagnosis is severe skeletal class II open bite with temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD) and disc displacement without reduction. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of TMJ pain and dysfunction. P: The management plan includes the use of a stabilization occlusal splint to address TMJ pain, followed by orthodontic treatment to correct the open bite. Surgery is not considered at this stage due to the patient's preference. Regular follow-ups will be necessary to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Informed consent will be obtained before initiating treatment. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Good morning. I understand you have a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, alcohol abuse, heroin abuse, and you're currently on methadone for that, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. I also have hepatitis C, latent tuberculosis, and I had a ventral hernia repair done before. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. What brings you to our institution's emergency department today? Patient: I've been having progressive shortness of breath for about a month now. I also noticed my abdominal girth increased within the same duration, which I think worsened my breathing. Doctor: I see. We'll need to do a chest X-ray and some laboratory tests to understand your situation better. The X-ray showed left lower lobe atelectasis. Your lab results indicate hemoglobin: 12.6 g/dL, white blood cell count: 11.5 103/uL, platelet count: 208 103/uL, creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen: 24 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 37 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 52 IU/L, total bilirubin: 0.5 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase: 72 IU/L. Patient: Okay, what does all that mean? Doctor: Your results suggest a COPD exacerbation, which could be contributing to your shortness of breath. We'll admit you to the medical floor for further evaluation and treatment. Regarding your increased abdominal girth, we consulted the surgery team to evaluate it, considering your history of ventral hernia repair. Patient: What did they find? Doctor: An abdominal CT scan was done, and it showed the anterior portion of the left hepatic lobe partially herniating through the ventral hernia, accompanied by hepatic steatosis. During the physical examination, we noticed you were in respiratory distress, with a distended abdomen, a midline scar, and a lump protruding through the midline. Patient: Oh, I see. What were my vital signs during the examination? Doctor: Your vital signs were blood pressure: 145/95 mmHg, heart rate: 133 beats per minute, and respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute. Patient: So, what's the plan now? Doctor: Due to your ongoing medical conditions, we will not perform hernia repair as an inpatient. However, during your hospital stay, your respiratory status improved, and we believe it is safe to discharge you home. You will need to schedule a follow-up appointment with the surgery clinic to discuss hernia repair as an outpatient. Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to follow up on that appointment. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of COPD, diabetes, alcohol and heroin abuse (currently on methadone), hepatitis C, latent tuberculosis, and a previous ventral hernia repair, reports progressive shortness of breath and increased abdominal girth over the past month. O: Physical examination revealed respiratory distress, distended abdomen, and a protruding lump at the midline scar. Vital signs showed BP 145/95 mmHg, HR 133 bpm, RR 30 bpm. Chest X-ray indicated left lower lobe atelectasis. Lab results: Hemoglobin 12.6 g/dL, WBC 11.5 103/uL, Platelets 208 103/uL, Creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, BUN 24 mg/dL, ALT 37 IU/L, AST 52 IU/L, Total Bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, Alkaline Phosphatase 72 IU/L. Abdominal CT scan showed partial herniation of the left hepatic lobe through the ventral hernia and hepatic steatosis. A: Primary diagnosis of COPD exacerbation contributing to shortness of breath. Differential diagnosis includes complications from herniated ventral hernia. The patient's increased abdominal girth likely exacerbates respiratory distress. P: Admit to medical floor for COPD exacerbation management and further evaluation. Consult surgery for hernia evaluation but defer repair to outpatient setting. Schedule follow-up in surgery clinic to discuss potential hernia repair. Educate patient on signs of respiratory distress and importance of follow-up appointments. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 57-year-old African-American male with a history of cerebral palsy. How have you been feeling lately? Patient: Well, I've been feeling severely disoriented and I think I had too much alcohol recently. Doctor: Okay, when you were admitted, your mental status was indeed altered due to alcohol intoxication and diabetic ketoacidosis. Your Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at that time was three. We performed a computerized tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess your condition. The scans revealed a left olfactory groove mass with surrounding hypodensity, which is concerning for vasogenic edema, as well as a right petroclival mass. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it was a serious situation. After treating your diabetic ketoacidosis and alcohol intoxication, we performed a bifrontal craniotomy, resected the left olfactory groove mass, cranialized the frontal sinus, and placed a pericranial flap. You were then treated with antibiotics and a dexamethasone taper. An immediate post-operative MRI showed good resection and expected changes. Patient: Okay, how did I do after the surgery? Doctor: Postoperatively, you did well and remained afebrile. However, we noticed increased swelling at your operative site. On postoperative day (POD) three, you developed markedly elevated leukocytosis. We conducted urinalysis and chest radiographs, which were not concerning for infections. But your blood cultures grew Serratia marcescens, so we started you on intravenous meropenem 2 grams every eight hours. Patient: Oh, I see. What happened next? Doctor: On POD 10, we performed a repeat CT scan which showed an enlarging epidural fluid collection and a new subgaleal fluid collection. We aspirated the subgaleal fluid, which also grew S. marcescens. Patient: What did you do after that? Doctor: We took you back to the operating room for a wound washout. An antibiotic sensitivity analysis was performed on the S. marcescens, revealing a meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of </= 0.25 mcg/mL and a gentamicin MIC of </= 1 mcg/mL. Patient: What happened during the wound washout? Doctor: In the operating room, as soon as we opened the galea, a copious amount of pink-colored purulent material began to spill from the wound. We thoroughly cleaned the wound and continued your antibiotic treatment. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. What do I need to do next? Doctor: You should continue taking your prescribed antibiotics and follow-up with us regularly to monitor your progress. We'll also want to keep an eye on the swelling and ensure that there are no further infections. If you have any concerns or notice any changes in your condition, please don't hesitate to contact us. [/INST] S: The patient is a 57-year-old African-American male with a history of cerebral palsy, presenting with severe disorientation and recent excessive alcohol consumption. He reports postoperative symptoms following a bifrontal craniotomy for resection of a left olfactory groove mass. O: Initial assessment showed a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, altered mental status due to alcohol intoxication and diabetic ketoacidosis. CT and MRI scans revealed a left olfactory groove mass with vasogenic edema and a right petroclival mass. Postoperative MRI confirmed good resection. The patient developed leukocytosis and Serratia marcescens bacteremia, treated with intravenous meropenem. Repeat CT indicated an enlarging epidural and new subgaleal fluid collection, both infected with S. marcescens. Wound washout released purulent material; continued antibiotic treatment is in place. A: Primary diagnosis of left olfactory groove mass with postoperative complications including infection by Serratia marcescens. Differential diagnoses initially included complications from cerebral palsy, alcohol intoxication, and diabetic ketoacidosis. The prognosis depends on effective management of the infection and monitoring for any further complications. P: Continue intravenous antibiotic therapy as prescribed. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor the infection and healing process. Educate the patient on signs of infection or complications to watch for and ensure immediate communication if symptoms worsen. Emphasize the importance of adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen to prevent further complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of prostate cancer. What brings you here today? Patient: Hi, Doc. I've been having black stools for a day and even had an episode of syncope recently. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms like nausea or poor appetite? Patient: Yes, actually. I've been feeling nauseous and lost my appetite for the last four weeks. I even lost fifteen pounds in the past six months without trying. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We ran some tests, and your initial lab workup showed a low hemoglobin level at 11 mg/dL and an elevated serum creatinine of 14.83 mg/dL, which is much higher than your baseline of 1.00 mg/dL. Your urinalysis also eluded to a large amount of dysmorphic red blood cells, 2+ urine protein, but no evidence of an underlying urinary tract infection (UTI). Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We also performed a renal ultrasound, which ruled out obstructive uropathy as the cause. You underwent two separate sessions of hemodialysis, which brought your serum creatinine levels back to baseline. Patient: Okay, that's a relief. Doctor: Given your prior history of prostate cancer, we did a non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) scan of your abdomen and pelvis. It revealed new osteoblastic lesions in your L2 vertebra and an asymmetrical thickening of the bladder wall, which is concerning for a recurred metastatic disease. Patient: Oh, no. What does that mean for me? Doctor: During your admission, you frequently passed melanotic stools, which led to a second syncopal episode and a drastic decline in your hemoglobin levels to 6 mg/dL. You were then transferred to our medical facility for further management. Patient: What happened next, Doc? Doctor: You were initially transfused with two units of packed red blood cells. Following that, you underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed a non-bleeding duodenal ulcer. We remedied it with bipolar cautery and clipping. Patient: I'm glad that was taken care of. Doctor: After the EGD, you were noted to have shortness of breath (SOB). We did a subsequent chest CT scan without contrast, which revealed emphysematous changes in bilateral lung fields, with interstitial fibrosis and nodular formations. Patient: What does all this mean for my health, doctor? Doctor: Your current predicament is concerning, but we will continue to monitor and manage your condition. We'll work closely with you to develop an appropriate treatment plan and ensure you receive the necessary care. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help in managing my health. Doctor: You're welcome. We're here to support you throughout this journey. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of prostate cancer, presents with black stools for one day, recent syncope, nausea, poor appetite for four weeks, and unintentional weight loss of fifteen pounds over six months. O: Initial labs showed hemoglobin at 11 mg/dL (normal: 13.8-17.2 mg/dL for men), serum creatinine elevated at 14.83 mg/dL (normal: 0.84-1.21 mg/dL), with baseline at 1.00 mg/dL. Urinalysis indicated large amounts of dysmorphic red blood cells and 2+ urine protein. Renal ultrasound ruled out obstructive uropathy. Post-hemodialysis, creatinine returned to baseline. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis revealed osteoblastic lesions in L2 vertebra and asymmetrical thickening of the bladder wall. During hospitalization, patient experienced a second syncopal episode, hemoglobin dropped to 6 mg/dL, and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells. EGD identified and treated a non-bleeding duodenal ulcer. Chest CT showed emphysematous changes, interstitial fibrosis, and nodular formations in the lungs. A: Primary diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer recurrence with secondary complications including acute kidney injury (resolved post-dialysis), gastrointestinal bleeding from a duodenal ulcer (treated), and chronic lung disease. Differential diagnoses include other causes of acute anemia and renal dysfunction. P: Continue monitoring hemoglobin and renal function. Maintain hemodialysis as needed. Follow up with oncology for management of metastatic prostate cancer, including potential chemotherapy or radiation. Gastroenterology follow-up for ulcer surveillance. Pulmonology consultation for assessment and management of chronic lung disease. Educate patient on signs of bleeding, renal failure, and respiratory distress. Ensure patient understands the treatment plan and importance of follow-up appointments. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I was diagnosed with a rectal tumor and lung metastasis back in July 2014. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about the treatments you have received so far? Patient: Yes, I was treated with Folfox-Bevacizumab for 2 months and then had radiochemotherapy with a combination of oxaliplatin and 5FU. Doctor: Okay, did you undergo any surgeries? Patient: Yes, in December 2014, I had a total mesorectal excision (TME) and a video-assisted thoracoscopic resection (VATS) of the lung lesion. Doctor: How was the final pathological stage of your cancer? Patient: It was ypT3N0M1 adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Doctor: And did you continue with any further treatment after the surgery? Patient: Yes, I underwent further treatment with Folfox-bevacizumab until the end of March. Doctor: What happened during your follow-up in May 2015? Patient: In May, during the time of planned restoration of bowel continuity, a relapse was noted in the liver and a resection of segment 4B was performed. Doctor: Were there any new developments in your condition after that? Patient: Yes, in November 2015, new liver lesions and a peripancreatic mass were found, and they also found a slight elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) - 5 μg/L. Doctor: How did your treatment progress after that? Patient: I started Folfiri-Bevacizumab, but after two months, a CT scan showed progressive disease with growth of the peripancreatic mass, liver metastases, and occurrence of an aortocaval lymph node. My CEA level had risen to 26 μg/L. Doctor: I see. Did you undergo any molecular analysis of the tumor? Patient: Yes, it was found to be KRAS-NRAS wild type (WT), BRAF mutant with a specific mutation, c.1781A > G (p.(Asp594Gly)) in exon 15 by Next Generation Sequencing (Massively parallel targeted re-sequencing Somatic 1 Multiplicom MASTR assay). Doctor: And what about the immunohistochemical staining? Was there any loss of expression of mismatch repair proteins? Patient: No, there was no loss of expression, suggesting microsatellite stability. The antibodies used were Clone ES05 (Novocastra) for MLH1, Clone 6219–1129 (Roche) for MSH2, and Clone EP49 (DAKO) for MSH6 and PMS2. Doctor: Thank you for providing all this information. Based on your history and test results, I will discuss your case with our team and come up with a suitable treatment plan. Please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we will discuss the next steps in managing your condition. [/INST] S: Patient reports being diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma and lung metastasis in July 2014. Treatments included Folfox-Bevacizumab, radiochemotherapy with oxaliplatin and 5FU, total mesorectal excision, and video-assisted thoracoscopic resection of the lung lesion. Post-surgery, the patient was staged as ypT3N0M1 and continued Folfox-Bevacizumab until March. A relapse in May 2015 led to liver resection. In November 2015, new liver lesions, a peripancreatic mass, and elevated CEA levels were noted. The patient started Folfiri-Bevacizumab, but disease progression was observed. Molecular analysis showed KRAS-NRAS WT, BRAF mutation, and microsatellite stability. O: Final pathological stage was ypT3N0M1. Recent imaging showed progression with new liver lesions, growth of the peripancreatic mass, and an aortocaval lymph node. CEA levels increased from 5 μg/L to 26 μg/L. Molecular analysis confirmed KRAS-NRAS WT, BRAF mutation c.1781A > G, and microsatellite stability with no loss of mismatch repair protein expression. A: The primary diagnosis is metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma with liver and peripancreatic involvement, classified as ypT3N0M1. Differential diagnoses could include other sources of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The prognosis is guarded due to the progressive nature of the disease and elevated CEA levels indicating active disease. P: Continue monitoring with regular imaging and CEA level assessments. Adjust chemotherapy regimen based on the latest response and molecular analysis results. Consider potential clinical trials given the BRAF mutation and progressive disease despite standard treatments. Schedule a multidisciplinary team meeting to discuss further therapeutic options. Educate the patient on signs of progression and when to seek immediate care. Arrange a follow-up appointment to review treatment efficacy and discuss any new symptoms. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that your chief complaint is feeling weak for the past 6 days. Can you tell me more about your family's medical history? Patient: Hi doc, yeah, my parents are first cousins, but they are both healthy. I have a fraternal twin who has no biochemistry or imaging abnormalities. My elder sister died of kidney failure at 23 years old. Doctor: Thank you for that information. We've conducted some tests and I'd like to discuss the results with you. Your height is 159 cm, which is shorter than the average adult male. We've found significant elevations in your levels of serum creatinine (420.0 μmol/L), cystatin-C (2.83 mg/L), and parathyroid hormone (83.38 pmol/L). Your estimated glomerular filtration rate is 14.84 ml/min.1.73m2. Patient: Hmm, okay. What does that mean, doc? Doctor: These results suggest that your kidney function may be impaired. We also performed ultrasound scans of your kidneys. The right kidney size is 9.1 × 4.3 × 4.2 cm and the left kidney size is 9.0 × 3.7 × 3.3 cm. Both kidneys are nearly normal in size, but each has a cortical microcyst (less than 1.5 cm) respectively. Patient: What about my blood pressure and other tests? Doctor: Your blood pressure, urinalysis, serum liver enzyme levels, lipid metabolism markers, serum uric acid level, electrolytes, and immune system markers are all normal. We also conducted computed tomography scans which showed normal abdominal and cerebral structures. Patient: So, did you do a renal biopsy to check my kidneys? Doctor: A renal biopsy was not performed due to the deteriorated kidney function. I'd like to ask about your medical history, have you experienced any issues with your urinary, visual, or auditory systems, such as polydipsia, polyuria, or secondary enuresis? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those problems. Doctor: Alright, we will follow up with you for one year with treatments including medicinal charcoal tablets and rocaltrol. After these treatments, we will re-evaluate your kidney function by checking your serum creatinine level and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patient: Okay, doc. Thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. We will closely monitor your condition and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. If you have any concerns or questions during your treatment, please don't hesitate to contact us. [/INST] S: The patient, a male with a height of 159 cm, reports feeling weak for the past 6 days. He has a family history of consanguinity with parents being first cousins, and a sister who died of kidney failure at 23. The patient denies any issues with urinary, visual, or auditory systems. O: Physical examination and tests reveal: Serum creatinine at 420.0 μmol/L (normal range: 62-106 μmol/L), cystatin-C at 2.83 mg/L (normal range: 0.53-0.95 mg/L), and parathyroid hormone at 83.38 pmol/L (normal range: 1.6-6.9 pmol/L). Estimated glomerular filtration rate is critically low at 14.84 ml/min/1.73m2. Ultrasound shows both kidneys nearly normal in size with a cortical microcyst in each. Blood pressure, urinalysis, serum liver enzyme levels, lipid metabolism markers, serum uric acid level, electrolytes, and immune system markers are normal. Computed tomography scans of abdominal and cerebral structures are normal. A: The primary diagnosis is chronic kidney disease (CKD), likely stage 4 given the significantly reduced eGFR and elevated serum creatinine and cystatin-C levels. Differential diagnosis could include other forms of inherited kidney disease, considering the family history of kidney failure. The presence of microcysts may suggest a polycystic kidney disease variant, though the normal kidney sizes and lack of other typical symptoms make this less likely. P: The management plan includes administration of medicinal charcoal tablets and rocaltrol to manage CKD complications. Close monitoring of the patient's condition with regular follow-ups scheduled yearly to re-evaluate kidney function through serum creatinine levels and eGFR. A renal biopsy is deferred due to deteriorated kidney function. The patient is advised to contact the healthcare provider for any concerns or symptoms during the treatment period. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I understand you were referred to our department due to an abnormal shadow on the left side of your chest wall found on a computed tomography scan. Can you tell me more about your medical history? Patient: Yes, I had a total hysterectomy and radiotherapy for cervical carcinoma 4 years ago. A year after that, I had surgery to remove metastatic lung nodules in both my right and left lungs. Doctor: I see. So you had wedge resection for the upper and lower lobes of your right lung through three-port thoracoscopic surgery, and then another wedge resection for the lower lobe of your left lung via eighth intercostal single incisional thoracoscopic surgery, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: After those surgeries, it seems like an intrathoracic chest wall mass developed and has been gradually increasing in size. Your gynecologist introduced you to our department for possible surgical resection of this mass. Can you tell me more about your family's health history? Patient: My family, including my parents and two sisters, is healthy. We don't have any inheritable diseases. Doctor: Good to know. Have you had any symptoms, drug history, tobacco smoking history, or psychosocial history? Are you a social drinker? Patient: I haven't had any symptoms. I don't have any drug or smoking history and no psychosocial history either. I am a social drinker, though. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Have you been taking any medications since the mass developed and until your admission to our hospital? Patient: No, I haven't taken any medications. Doctor: I understand you've had three operations in the past and you're a carrier of type B hepatitis. How has your general condition been since your admission to our department? Patient: My general condition has been good. I have three operative scars on both sides of my chest and lower abdomen, but my chest sounds are clear and there's no neurological abnormality.

Patient: Yes, for over a month now, I've had diminished vision in my left eye, especially when chewing. But I haven't had any other concomitant symptoms. Doctor: I see. And I noticed that you were diagnosed with hepatic CE back in 2010. Did you receive any treatment for that? Patient: No, I didn't receive any treatment at the time. Doctor: Alright, let's discuss your recent test results. Your magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) of the paranasal sinus revealed a 47 x 44-mm cystic mass in your left infratemporal fossa, which has been determined as type CE2 according to the WHO classification. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Some lesions have infiltrated into the intracranial and orbital areas, and the upper maxillary sinus cavity is compressed, as evidenced by the contrast-enhanced MRI. Patient: What else did you find, doctor? Doctor: A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a rounded cyst measuring 16 x 20 mm with a clear boundary, regular shape, and homogenous hypoecho in your left ventricle myocardium. Your left ventricle systolic function is normal, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 66%. Patient: Alright, and what about the rest of the tests? Doctor: The contrast-enhanced chest CT revealed a low-density mass measuring approximately 33.05 x 12.27 mm within your left ventricle. Your upper abdominal CT scan revealed two round, low-density, echogenic cystic lesions involving segment seven of your liver, with the largest lesions measuring approximately 28.09 x 27.32 mm. Patient: That's a lot to take in. Doctor: Yes, and we also detected multiple small vesicular structures within the lesions, determined to be WHO type CE2. Small lesions were also visible beside the large ones. Patient: Anything else, doctor? Doctor: We found multiple purely unilocular cystic low-attenuation masses in your abdomen, with the largest lesions being type CE1 and measuring approximately 60.44 x 54.40 mm. There is also a low-attenuation multiseptated mass of type CE2 in your pancreatic tail, measuring approximately 44.96 x 51.43 mm. Patient: What about the pelvic CT scan? Doctor: The pelvic CT scan showed an uneven distribution of intracystic density and the presence of WHO type CE3B daughter cysts, measuring 92.02 x 37.21 mm. Patient: I see. What's the next step, doctor? Doctor: Given your diagnosis and the extent of the cysts, we need to discuss a treatment plan for you. I'll consult with a team of specialists and schedule a follow-up appointment to go over our recommendations. In the meantime, please monitor your symptoms and let us know if anything changes. Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient reports diminished vision in the left eye, particularly when chewing, persisting for over a month. No other concomitant symptoms were mentioned. The patient has a history of close contact with dogs and sheep and was diagnosed with hepatic cystic echinococcosis (CE) in 2010 but did not receive treatment. O: MRI and CT scans of the paranasal sinus show a 47 x 44-mm cystic mass in the left infratemporal fossa, classified as WHO type CE2, with infiltration into intracranial and orbital areas and compression of the upper maxillary sinus. Transthoracic echocardiogram reveals a 16 x 20 mm cyst in the left ventricle myocardium, with normal left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction 66%). Chest CT shows a 33.05 x 12.27 mm low-density mass in the left ventricle. Upper abdominal CT identifies two round, low-density cystic lesions in liver segment seven, the largest being 28.09 x 27.32 mm, with multiple small vesicular structures (WHO type CE2). Abdominal CT reveals multiple unilocular cystic low-attenuation masses, the largest being type CE1 and measuring 60.44 x 54.40 mm, and a multiseptated mass of type CE2 in the pancreatic tail, measuring 44.96 x 51.43 mm. Pelvic CT shows an uneven distribution of intracystic density with WHO type CE3B daughter cysts, measuring 92.02 x 37.21 mm. A: The primary diagnosis is disseminated cystic echinococcosis with involvement of the infratemporal fossa, liver, left ventricle, pancreas, and pelvis. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of cystic masses or tumors, but imaging and history strongly suggest echinococcosis. The prognosis depends on the response to treatment and potential complications from cyst rupture or organ dysfunction. P: The management plan includes consultation with a multidisciplinary team to discuss treatment options, which may involve antiparasitic therapy, surgical intervention, or other targeted treatments depending on the cyst location and systemic involvement. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled to review treatment recommendations. The patient is advised to monitor symptoms and report any changes. Education on the nature of the disease and potential complications will be provided to ensure understanding and compliance with the treatment plan. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see you've been admitted to the hospital with epigastric pain and fevers. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've been having this terrible pain in my upper stomach, along with high fevers and just generally feeling unwell. Doctor: I understand. We ran some tests and found that you have an elevated white cell count, which indicates an infection. We also performed an abdominal CT scan which demonstrated evidence of duodenal diverticulitis. We've started you on broad-spectrum IV antibiotics to treat the infection. Patient: Oh, okay. But I still feel really bad, like my condition is getting worse. Doctor: Yes, we noticed that your clinical condition worsened overnight with persistent tachycardia, an increase in your white cell count, and more fevers. Your examination also showed signs of peritonitis. We then performed an interval CT scan which revealed a significant amount of air and fluid in your abdomen, concerning for free perforation. Patient: That sounds serious. What's the next step? Doctor: We've decided that you need to undergo an exploration and a possible pancreatoduodenectomy. This surgery will address the large perforation we found in your 4 cm juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum, which is originating from the posterior-medial wall and causing peritonitis. Patient: Is there any other option? Doctor: Due to the very medial location of the perforation, in close proximity to the insertion of the ampulla, a segmental resection is not possible. The pancreatoduodenectomy is the best option to address the issue. Patient: Alright, if that's what needs to be done. (After surgery) Doctor: The surgery went well. Pathology confirmed the perforation originated from the duodenal diverticulum, and no additional abnormal findings were present. You tolerated the procedure without any complications. Patient: That's a relief. What's the recovery process like? Doctor: You'll need to stay in the hospital for about 10 days to recover. After that, you will be discharged and should continue to recover at home. We'll follow up with you in 2 months to see how you're doing. Patient: Okay, I hope everything goes smoothly. (2 months later) Doctor: How have you been feeling since the surgery? Patient: I've been doing well, actually. I've returned to work and feel so much better. Doctor: That's great to hear! Keep taking care of yourself and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. [/INST] S: The patient, a middle-aged adult, presented with chief complaints of severe epigastric pain, high fevers, and general malaise. The patient described the pain as terrible and located in the upper stomach. The symptoms worsened overnight, and the patient reported feeling that their condition was deteriorating. O: Initial examination revealed an elevated white cell count indicative of infection. An abdominal CT scan showed evidence of duodenal diverticulitis. Subsequent clinical observations noted persistent tachycardia, increased white cell count, and ongoing fevers. A follow-up CT scan indicated a significant presence of air and fluid in the abdomen, suggesting free perforation. Surgical intervention confirmed a 4 cm juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum perforation originating from the posterior-medial wall. Post-operative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged after a 10-day hospital stay. A: The primary diagnosis was perforated duodenal diverticulitis with associated peritonitis. The differential diagnosis initially considered other causes of epigastric pain and infection, but imaging and surgical findings confirmed the primary diagnosis. The prognosis is favorable following successful surgical management, with the patient reporting significant improvement and return to normal activities at the 2-month follow-up. P: The management plan included immediate broad-spectrum IV antibiotics followed by surgical exploration and pancreatoduodenectomy, which was necessary due to the medial location of the perforation and proximity to critical structures. Post-operatively, the patient was advised a 10-day hospital recovery period, followed by home recovery. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for 2 months post-discharge to monitor recovery progress. The patient was advised to maintain regular follow-ups and report any new symptoms or concerns. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi Ms. XY, can you tell me why you presented to the ED today? Patient: Well, I had some mushrooms that I foraged and prepared for dinner. A few hours later, I started having abdominal pain and vomiting. Doctor: I see. How long after eating the mushrooms did you start experiencing these symptoms? Patient: It was between six to eight hours later. Doctor: And how persistent was the vomiting? Patient: It kept happening for the next two to three hours, so I called an ambulance to take me to the hospital. Doctor: Okay. Upon admission, we found that your liver profile was deranged, and you were diagnosed with acute liver failure secondary to the fungi consumption. As a result, you were transferred to the National Liver Unit for an orthotopic liver transplant. Patient: Yeah, I remember that. It was a rough time. Doctor: Unfortunately, your post-operative course was tumultuous. You required admission to the ICU and had input from Hepatic, Renal, Plastics, Rheumatology, and Dermatology teams. We also found an incidental finding on a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Patient: Oh, that's right. After I was discharged from the ICU, I started having painful discolouration at the tips of my fingers and toes. Doctor: Yes, our Dermatology team diagnosed you with skin necrosis post-transplant and microvascular thrombosis of the hands and feet. You also had painful lesions in your right flank region, which required a skin graft performed by the Plastics team. Patient: I remember that. My recovery was complicated by sepsis, and I was treated with antibiotics. Doctor: That's correct. You were also on a prolonged course of steroids for up to six months post-operatively. As you continued to improve clinically, we had a multi-disciplinary team helping with your recovery. However, you mentioned a new onset of groin pain, which caused regression in your mobility. Can you tell me more about that? Patient: Yeah, the pain has been getting worse over the past four weeks, and it's really affecting my progress with physiotherapy. Doctor: We performed a physical exam and noticed that your knee is swollen and erythematous, with a reduced range of motion. We will continue to monitor your progress and work with the multi-disciplinary team to address your pain and mobility issues. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all the help and support. [/INST] S: Ms. XY presented to the ED with abdominal pain and vomiting occurring 6-8 hours after consuming self-foraged mushrooms. She reported persistent vomiting for 2-3 hours post-ingestion. Post liver transplant, she experienced complications including skin necrosis, microvascular thrombosis, and painful lesions requiring skin grafts. She also developed sepsis treated with antibiotics and was on steroids for six months. Recently, she reported worsening groin pain over the past four weeks, impacting her physiotherapy progress. O: Initial examination revealed acute liver failure, leading to an orthotopic liver transplant. Post-operative complications included ICU admission, involvement from multiple specialty teams, and an incidental finding on CT abdomen and pelvis. Current physical exam shows swollen, erythematous knee with reduced mobility. Liver profile was initially deranged. A: Primary diagnosis is acute liver failure secondary to mushroom toxicity, complicated by post-transplant skin necrosis, microvascular thrombosis, and sepsis. Differential diagnosis for current symptoms includes joint infection or inflammation secondary to prolonged steroid use and post-operative complications. P: Continue monitoring liver function and knee symptoms. Manage pain and inflammation with appropriate medication and continue with physiotherapy. Consult Rheumatology for potential steroid-induced complications and Orthopedics for joint assessment. Educate patient on signs of infection and importance of adherence to medication and physiotherapy regimen. Schedule follow-up appointments with Hepatology, Dermatology, and Plastics to manage ongoing post-transplant complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're a 72-year-old Chinese female and a non-smoker. You've suffered from hypertension for over 30 years, chronic bronchitis for over 20 years, and diabetes for 6 years. What brings you here today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I was admitted to the hospital because I had a productive cough for three weeks, and then my symptoms became more severe during the past week. Doctor: I see. During our examination, we found that your respiratory sounds were weak and coarser in the right lung field. Your laboratory examination revealed a high percentage of monocytes, a low level of hemoglobinn, and a low mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. We also performed an F-FDG PET-CTA, which showed a hypermetabolic mass in the upper lobe of your right lung and enlargement of your right hilar and subcarinal lymph nodes. These findings suggest that you may have lung cancer and lymph node metastases. The tumor measured 2.8 × 2.2 × 3 cm and appeared ulcerated. Patient: Oh my. That's quite concerning. Doctor: Yes, we needed to further investigate the tumor. We performed routine histologic sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin, which showed that the tumor cells grew infiltratively in fibrous interstitium and arranged in sheets and syncytial pattern with marked pleomorphism. The neoplastic cells presented a vacuolar nucleus with prominent nucleoli and a marked lymphocytes infiltration. Patient: What does that mean, doctor? Doctor: These findings are similar to those seen in nasopharyngeal lymphoepithelioma, so we first wanted to confirm the absence of a primary lesion in your nasopharynx. We then performed immunohistochemistry staining on formalin-fixed paraffin sections to confirm the diagnosis. The tumor cells were strongly positive for CK5/6 and P40, which helped us exclude large-cell lymphoma. In addition, the tumor cells showed negative immunostaining of Napsin A, TTF1, CD56, CgA, and Syn, further excluding the possibilities of lung adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma. Patient: So what exactly is the diagnosis? Doctor: We found that the latent membrane protein (LMP1) expression of the Epstein-Barr virus was positive in the tumor cells. We also performed chemiluminescence analysis of EB virus antibodies, which showed that EBV-EA IgA and EBV-VCA IgG were both positive. This confirms that your tumor is associated with the Epstein-Barr virus. Patient: I see. What's the next step, doctor? Doctor: We will discuss your case with our team and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. We will keep you informed throughout the process and ensure that you receive the best care possible. It is important to monitor your symptoms and follow-up with us for regular check-ups as well. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance during this difficult time. [/INST] S: The patient, a 72-year-old Chinese female with a history of hypertension, chronic bronchitis, and diabetes, presented with a chief complaint of a productive cough lasting three weeks, which worsened over the past week.

F-FDG PET-CTA indicated a hypermetabolic mass in the upper lobe of the right lung, measuring 2.8 × 2.2 × 3 cm, with right hilar and subcarinal lymph node enlargement. Histologic examination confirmed infiltrative growth of tumor cells with marked pleomorphism and lymphocyte infiltration. Immunohistochemistry was positive for CK5/6 and P40, negative for Napsin A, TTF1, CD56, CgA, and Syn. EBV-related markers (LMP1, EBV-EA IgA, EBV-VCA IgG) were positive. A: The patient is diagnosed with Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the lung, with lymph node metastasis. Differential diagnoses such as large-cell lymphoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and neuroendocrine carcinoma have been excluded based on immunohistochemistry. P: The treatment plan will be developed in consultation with a multidisciplinary team and tailored to the patient's specific needs. Regular monitoring and follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and manage any arising complications. The patient will be educated about the nature of her diagnosis, treatment options, and the importance of adherence to the prescribed management plan. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 22-year-old African American male who initially presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of fever, chills, sore throat, and odynophagia. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, I've had a high fever, chills, a really sore throat, and it's been painful to swallow. Doctor: During your examination at the emergency department, you were found to be febrile with a temperature of 104°F and tachycardic. There was localized tenderness over your neck, and hyperemic and hypertrophic bilateral tonsils with whitish exudate. A CT scan of the neck with contrast was done and showed acute tonsillitis with no peritonsillar abscess. Blood cultures and throat cultures were sent as part of a routine workup of a febrile patient. You were discharged from the emergency department on amoxicillin/clavulanate for acute tonsillitis. Did you take the prescribed medication? Patient: No, I actually haven't taken any medications in the past two days. Doctor: I see. We called you back because your blood cultures showed growth for Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, and there was also growth of beta-hemolytic streptococcus on throat cultures. On readmission, a new set of blood cultures were drawn, and you were started on intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam. How have you been feeling since starting the new medication? Patient: Well, after five days of antibiotics, I still have a persistent fever, leukocytosis, throat pain, and dysphagia. Doctor: During your physical examination, you had increased localized tenderness over your neck, without any fluctuating mass. At this point, another CT scan of the neck with contrast was repeated to rule out any drainable collection. The repeat CT scan showed rim-enhancing left peritonsillar collections with adjacent thrombophlebitis. Additionally, an axial contrast-enhanced chest CT scan revealed multiple new patchy cavitary nodules of the lung, which are suspicious for septic emboli. The Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria from your initial emergency department visit were later identified as Porphyromonas asaccharolytica. Repeat blood cultures did not show growth of any microorganism. Patient: So what's the next step in my treatment? Doctor: We will continue the intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam, and we're adding metronidazole to your treatment regimen. It's important that you take the prescribed medications as directed and follow up with us regularly to monitor your progress. Patient: Alright, I understand. I'll make sure to take the medications and keep track of my symptoms. Thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: 22-year-old African American male presents with a three-day history of high fever, chills, severe sore throat, and painful swallowing (odynophagia). The patient reports persistent symptoms despite initial treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate, which he discontinued two days after discharge from the emergency department. He has not experienced any improvement with the current regimen of intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam started five days ago. O: Initial examination revealed a temperature of 104°F, tachycardia, localized neck tenderness, hyperemic and hypertrophic bilateral tonsils with whitish exudate. CT scan indicated acute tonsillitis without peritonsillar abscess. Recent examinations show persistent fever, leukocytosis, and increased localized neck tenderness. Repeat CT scan shows rim-enhancing left peritonsillar collections with adjacent thrombophlebitis. Chest CT scan reveals multiple patchy cavitary nodules in the lungs, suggestive of septic emboli. Blood and throat cultures initially grew Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria (Porphyromonas asaccharolytica) and beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Recent blood cultures show no growth. A: The primary diagnosis is complicated acute tonsillitis with suspected septic emboli secondary to Porphyromonas asaccharolytica infection. Differential diagnoses include other sources of infection or non-infectious causes of similar symptoms. The presence of septic emboli complicates the prognosis, requiring aggressive and prolonged antibiotic therapy. P: Continue intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam and add metronidazole to the treatment regimen. Emphasize the importance of medication adherence and regular follow-up to monitor therapeutic response and potential complications. Educate the patient on the signs of worsening infection or new symptoms. Arrange for a follow-up appointment in one week, or sooner if symptoms do not improve or worsen. Consider referral to an infectious disease specialist if there is no improvement or further complications arise. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you were referred to our hospital with a chief complaint of swelling in the alveolar region of a maxillary anterior tooth. Can you tell me how long this has been going on? Patient: Yes, the swelling has been present for about a month prior to coming here. Doctor: Alright, let's do an intraoral examination first. I can see alveolar swelling on the labial side of the maxillary anterior tooth region. The mucosa of the retromolar region has a normal color and no evident swelling (Fig. a). I think we should do a panoramic radiographic examination to get a better look at the issue. Patient: Okay, sounds good. Doctor: The panoramic radiographic examination revealed well-demarcated radiolucent lesions in the maxillary anterior tooth and the right retromolar regions (Fig. b). We will need to do a computed tomography (CT) scan as well to get a clearer picture. Patient: Alright, let's do it. Doctor: The CT scan shows well-demarcated low-density areas, measuring 35 × 30 mm and 17 × 12 mm, in the maxillary anterior tooth and right retromolar regions (Fig. c). Based on these findings, the lesions were clinically diagnosed as a radicular cyst of the left lateral incisor and an additional suspected tumor of the right retromolar region. We will need to perform a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Patient: Okay, I understand. Doctor: The pathological examination of the biopsy specimens revealed a radicular cyst of the left maxillary lateral incisor, and a suspected case of odontogenic myxoma in the right retromolar region. We will need to schedule a surgery in May to resect the maxillary cyst and the tumor in the retromolar region under general anesthesia. Patient: Alright, let's do it. Doctor: The surgery was successful, and we resected the mucosa lining the retromolar region and the soft tissue of the bone defect. I'm happy to report that there was no recurrence of either condition at the final follow-up examination, 2 years later. Patient: That's great news! Thank you, doctor. Doctor: The histopathological examination of the removed tissue identified stellate-shaped and spindle-shaped fibroblasts interspersed in an abundant myxoid matrix. Sparsely intercalated fibrous connective tissue was also observed (Fig. a, b). Alcian blue and periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) staining of the mucinous substrate of the tissue demonstrated a positive reaction with Alcian blue and a negative reaction with PAS (Fig. c). Sparse formation of reticular fibers was observed via the silver impregnation method (Fig. d). S-100 positive cells were not identified in immunohistochemistry. Patient: I see. So, what does all that mean for my future health? Doctor: These findings indicate that the surgery was successful in removing the cyst and tumor, and there is no sign of recurrence. You should continue to have regular check-ups and maintain good oral hygiene to prevent any future issues. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient presented with a chief complaint of swelling in the alveolar region of a maxillary anterior tooth, which had been ongoing for about a month. The patient reported no other symptoms during the consultation. O: Initial intraoral examination showed swelling on the labial side of the maxillary anterior tooth region, with normal mucosa in the retromolar region. Panoramic radiography revealed well-demarcated radiolucent lesions in the maxillary anterior tooth and right retromolar regions. Subsequent CT scan confirmed low-density areas measuring 35 × 30 mm in the maxillary anterior tooth and 17 × 12 mm in the right retromolar region. Biopsy confirmed a radicular cyst of the left maxillary lateral incisor and a suspected odontogenic myxoma in the right retromolar region. Surgery was performed to resect both lesions, with histopathological examination confirming the initial diagnoses. Follow-up over 2 years showed no recurrence. A: The primary diagnosis was a radicular cyst of the left maxillary lateral incisor and odontogenic myxoma in the right retromolar region. Differential diagnoses considered included other types of cysts and tumors, but were ruled out by biopsy and histopathological examination. P: The management plan included surgical resection of the cyst and tumor under general anesthesia, which was successfully completed. Post-operative care involved regular follow-ups and maintaining good oral hygiene to prevent recurrence.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 26-year-old male non-hypertensive patient. Can you tell me why you were hospitalized on August 11, 2016? Patient: Yes, I was hospitalized because of my 8-year history of elevated SCr, and I've been on maintenance HD for 7 years. Doctor: I understand. I can see that the next day you were transplanted with a deceased kidney donor due to your preoperative SCr of 893 umol/L and BUN of 27.32 mmol/L (shown in Additional file: Figure S2). Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Following the transplantation, you received standard triple immunosuppression as well as regular follow-up assessments, correct? Patient: Yes, I did. Doctor: It seems that Cyclosporine A (CsA) was substituted for Tac in your treatment plan, but your renal graft still gradually developed DGF with SCr of 534 umol/L and BUN of 30.06 mmol/L (Additional file: Figure S2). Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: I see that on post-op day 38, a USG-guided renal biopsy was employed (Fig. b). The biopsy detected deposition of diffuse CaOx crystals as well as acute TCMR (2015 Banff 2A) in the renal graft (Fig. c, 200X HE and polarized light). However, there were no oxalate crystals in the ZHIB. Can you confirm this? Patient: Yes, that's what the biopsy found. Doctor: Molecular genetic testing was conducted and identified two mutations in the AGXT gene: exon 1: c.33dupC (p. Lys12fs), frameshift PV; and exon 2: c.215A > T (p. Asn72Ile), missense VUS. Additionally, one mutation in the MUT gene (Exon11: c.1897G > C (p. Val633Leu), missense VUS) was detected. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with PH1. Does that sound accurate? Patient: Yes, that's the diagnosis. Doctor: It appears you were treated with PN (400 mg, iv, QD) and temporary intensive HD for your PH1. Can you confirm this? Patient: Yes, that's the treatment I received. Doctor: Lastly, I noticed that you were dealing with anemia as well, with hemoglobin levels (HGB) ranging from 57 to 62 g/L. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, I've been struggling with anemia. Doctor: Thank you for the information. We will continue monitoring your condition and adjust your treatment plan as necessary. It's important to keep up with your follow-up assessments and report any new symptoms or concerns to your healthcare team. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to keep in touch with my healthcare team and follow up as needed. [/INST] S: The patient is a 26-year-old male with an 8-year history of elevated serum creatinine (SCr) and has been on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) for 7 years. He was hospitalized for a kidney transplant from a deceased donor due to preoperative SCr of 893 umol/L and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 27.32 mmol/L. Post-transplant, he developed delayed graft function (DGF) with current SCr of 534 umol/L and BUN of 30.06 mmol/L. He reports receiving standard triple immunosuppression therapy and regular follow-ups. He also has a history of anemia with hemoglobin levels ranging from 57 to 62 g/L. O: Postoperative day 38 ultrasound-guided renal biopsy showed deposition of diffuse calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals and acute T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) Banff 2A in the renal graft. Molecular genetic testing revealed two mutations in the AGXT gene and one mutation in the MUT gene, confirming a diagnosis of Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (PH1). The patient's treatment includes Pyridoxine (PN) 400 mg intravenously daily and temporary intensive HD. A: The primary diagnosis is Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (PH1) with complications including delayed graft function and anemia. Differential diagnoses previously considered likely included other causes of chronic kidney disease and transplant rejection. P: Continue monitoring renal function and adjust immunosuppressive therapy as needed. Maintain Pyridoxine treatment and intensive hemodialysis regimen. Manage anemia with appropriate interventions. Regular follow-up assessments are crucial, and patient education on symptom monitoring and timely reporting is essential. Referral to a genetic counselor may be beneficial given the genetic findings. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, Case 3 (Fig.). I understand that you're currently incarcerated for committing brutal violence, such as injuring a shop owner just to get his money. Is that correct? Patient: Yeah, that's right. Doctor: Have you been suffering from any symptoms or dysfunction recently? Patient: No, I don't feel any suffering or anything like that. Doctor: I see. I understand you're seeking rehabilitation for your dependency on cocaine, which has caused you certain problems while imprisoned, such as withdrawal symptoms and symptoms of intoxication like tremor and dry mouth. Is that accurate? Patient: Yeah, that's true. It's been quite a problem in here. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. We recently conducted a psychiatric evaluation on you, and it concluded that your personality features meet the ICD-10 criteria for F60.2 Dissocial Personality Disorder, including some characteristic psychopathic traits like callousness and exploitativeness, and narcissistic traits like entitlement. Are you aware of these traits in yourself? Patient: Hmm, yeah, I guess that sounds about right. Doctor: Can you tell me a bit about your childhood? What kind of relationship did you have with your parents, especially your father? Patient: I don't remember much, but my father was extremely physically abusive towards me and my mother. I was always emotionally detached from them. Doctor: I see. How about your friendships? Do you experience anything positive from them or do you only value them for the favors they can provide you? Patient: Honestly, I don't care much about friendships unless they can do something for me. Doctor: You also mentioned that you're not ashamed of admitting that you don't care about harming others and that you're even proud of it. Is that correct? Patient: Yeah, that's true. I don't feel any emotional or physical pain, and I don't have any remorse for what I've done. Doctor: Based on your clinical presentation, we've classified your condition as Severe Personality Disorder with prominent features of Dissociality, Disinhibition, and some Detachment. Your past history and future expectation of causing severe harm to others, along with your lack of genuine value for friendships and self-view characterized by entitlement, contribute to this classification. Moderate Personality Disorder would not apply in your case. Patient: Okay, I understand. Doctor: We'll work on a treatment plan to address your Severe Personality Disorder, focusing on your Dissociality, Disinhibition, and Detachment traits. This plan will include therapy and possibly medication to help manage your symptoms and improve your overall well-being. It's important that you're committed to this treatment to achieve the best possible outcome. Patient: Alright, I'll give it a try. [/INST] S: The patient, currently incarcerated, reports no physical suffering but acknowledges issues related to cocaine dependency, including withdrawal symptoms and intoxication symptoms such as tremor and dry mouth. He has a history of severe physical abuse from his father and describes a lack of emotional connection with his parents and friends, using relationships primarily for personal gain. The patient admits to a lack of remorse for his actions and expresses pride in his capacity to harm others without feeling emotional or physical pain. O: Psychiatric evaluation aligns with ICD-10 criteria for F60.2 Dissocial Personality Disorder, noting traits of callousness, exploitativeness, and narcissism. The patient's clinical presentation supports a diagnosis of Severe Personality Disorder with prominent features of Dissociality, Disinhibition, and Detachment. A: Primary diagnosis is Severe Personality Disorder with significant Dissocial, Disinhibitory, and Detached traits. Differential diagnosis could consider other personality disorders, but the severe nature of the symptoms and the patient's history support the current diagnosis. The prognosis is cautious, given the patient's history and current lack of remorse, but engagement in treatment could improve outcomes. P: The treatment plan will focus on managing the patient's Severe Personality Disorder through therapy and potential medication. Emphasis will be on addressing Dissociality, Disinhibition, and Detachment. The plan includes regular psychiatric consultations and possible involvement in a rehabilitation program for substance abuse. Patient education will aim at increasing awareness of the disorder's impact and the importance of compliance with the treatment plan to improve overall well-being. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, I see that you're a 14-year-old male patient who presented with dizziness since yesterday. Have you experienced any loss of consciousness, weakness in your extremities, or seizures? Patient: No, I haven't experienced any of those things. Doctor: I noticed you also complained of non-bloody, nonbilious, and projectile vomiting. Do you have any abdominal pain or diarrhea? Patient: No, there's no pain or diarrhea. Doctor: I see that you had similar complaints of dizziness one and a half months ago after falling off your bicycle. Can you tell me more about that? Patient: Yes, I felt dizzy after the fall, but it went away after a while. Doctor: Alright. I understand your parents had a nonconsanguineous marriage, and your father unfortunately suffered a premature cardiovascular death at the age of 35. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: When you first came to the clinic, you were in a hemodynamically stable state, and your neurological evaluation was normal without any complaints of weakness, positive Babinski sign, or sensory involvement. We admitted you for a thorough evaluation of your vertigo. Local causes of vertigo were ruled out after an ear, nose, and throat consultation. An ophthalmology evaluation was done to rule out causes of raised intracranial tension, and there was no evidence of papilloedema on indirect ophthalmoscopy. Your anthropometric review showed an increased arm length more than your height. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: You then suddenly became drowsy with complaints of right-sided weakness and continuous hiccups with high fever spikes. We decided to move you to the pediatric intensive care unit. Your neurological assessment showed upper motor neuron facial nerve palsy, evident from right-sided hemiparesis. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it is concerning. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral cerebellar non-hemorrhagic infarcts. Unfortunately, your condition deteriorated, and you developed respiratory distress, pooling of secretions, hoarseness of voice, and deviation of the uvula to the right side with an absent gag reflex. This suggests a medullary component with ninth and tenth nerve involvement. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: We're doing our best to manage and treat your condition. Other examinations, including complete blood count, coagulation profile, 2D echocardiogram, and electrocardiogram, were found to be normal. This helps us rule out arrhythmias for syncope workup. The antinuclear antibody assessment was negative, which helps rule out any autoimmune causes. Patient: Alright, so what's next for me? Doctor: Our team will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide the appropriate treatment and care. We will keep you and your family informed of any changes and developments in your condition. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you were admitted to our hospital suffering from chronic lumbar pain for ten years, and it has been aggravating after physical labour. Can you tell me more about your recent symptoms? Patient: Yes, about 4 months ago, I had violent low back pain and numbness in my left leg. It started from my left hip and went all the way down to my foot. Doctor: I see. During your physical examination, we found tenderness of interspinal areas in your low lumbar and hypesthesia to pinprick in the L5 and S1 dermatomal distribution, as well as a positive straight leg raising sign. Your routine spinal X-rays showed L4 spondylolisthesis and spondylolysis on both sides. The CT scan reconfirmed these findings and also showed evidence of disc protrusion and lumbar stenosis at L4/5 and L5/S1, compressing your left L5 and S1 root. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, as a result, you underwent a posterior lumbar decompression surgery at L4-S1, internal fixation, and intervertebral fusion at L4/5 and L5/S1. You were discharged on the 6th day after the surgery, and the outcome seemed satisfactory. However, before your discharge, we noticed a black shadow at the surgical place on your routine X-ray. Patient: I remember that. Then, 10 days later, I had an uncontrolled lumbar sprain and started having trouble with excretion. Doctor: That's correct. You were readmitted to our hospital, and we performed a CT and MRI which detected a gas pseudocyst compressing the dura sac. We took laboratory studies before the revision surgery to rule out the possibility of infection. Patient: What did you do about the gas pseudocyst? Doctor: We performed a debridement surgery to remove it. During the procedure, we heard a sound of rushing air when the deep fascia and muscle were opened through the previous route. We found a thin, blister-like membranous structure surrounded by a little clot organization in the surgical field, which was significantly compressing the dural sac. However, there was no sign of infection. Patient: So, you removed the membranous structure and clot organization, right? Doctor: Yes, we removed them until the dura sac was no longer compressed. How are you feeling now? Patient: I feel much better, thank you. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. It's important to continue monitoring your progress and follow up with any necessary treatments or check-ups. If you experience any new symptoms or worsening pain, please reach out to us immediately. Patient: I will. Thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, who has a history of chronic lumbar pain for ten years, exacerbated by physical labor, reported an onset of violent low back pain and numbness in the left leg starting from the hip to the foot approximately four months ago. The patient describes the pain as having started suddenly and mentions difficulty with excretion following a lumbar sprain post-surgery. O: Physical examination revealed tenderness in the interspinal areas of the low lumbar region, hypesthesia to pinprick in the L5 and S1 dermatomal distribution, and a positive straight leg raising sign. Spinal X-rays and CT scans showed L4 spondylolisthesis, spondylolysis, disc protrusion, and lumbar stenosis at L4/5 and L5/S1, compressing the left L5 and S1 root. Post-surgical X-rays indicated a black shadow at the surgical site. Subsequent CT and MRI identified a gas pseudocyst compressing the dura sac. Laboratory studies ruled out infection. A: The primary diagnosis is chronic lumbar pain due to L4 spondylolisthesis and spondylolysis with complications of disc protrusion and lumbar stenosis. The patient underwent successful posterior lumbar decompression surgery, internal fixation, and intervertebral fusion, followed by a second surgery for debridement of a gas pseudocyst. No infection was found. P: The patient is advised to continue post-operative care and monitoring. Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to assess progress and detect any potential complications early. The patient should avoid strenuous physical activity and follow prescribed physical therapy to aid recovery. Immediate medical attention is required for any new symptoms or worsening pain. Further consultations with a neurologist may be considered if neurological symptoms persist or worsen. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello there, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I'm a 22-year-old unmarried South Asian female. I've been experiencing some issues with my right eye for the past four months. Doctor: I see. Can you describe the issues you've been experiencing? Patient: Yes, it all started with a headache that lasted one day and then I began to notice metamorphopsia in my right eye. Like, when I look at the straight grid lines on Excel, they appear wavy. Doctor: Hmm, that's concerning. Have you had any issues with your vision before this? Patient: Yeah, I've had refractive errors in both my right (-1.00 dioptre sphere, DS) and left (-0.50 DS) eyes for three years now. Doctor: Okay, let's perform an ocular examination first. *After the examination* I found that your best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the right eye is 6/24. Your left eye has a visual acuity of 6/18 and a BCVA of 6/6. Patient: Is that bad, doctor? Doctor: It's not ideal, but let's see what else we find. *After the fundus examination* I noticed 2+ vitreous cells and a slightly elevated area of yellow-white active retinitis of two to three disc diameters (DD) over the macula in your right eye. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It means there's some inflammation and retinitis in your right eye. We'll need to perform a fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) to get a better understanding. *After FFA* The results show a hyperfluorescent patch of increasing intensity of 2DD temporal to the optic disc in your right eye. Patient: What's the next step? Doctor: We'll conduct an axial optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan. *After OCT scan* The scan revealed an irregular, thickened surface of the retina with loss of foveal contour and pigment epithelial detachment in your right eye. These findings are highly suggestive of a choroidal neovascular membrane. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: It's a condition that can cause vision problems like the ones you've been experiencing. I also performed an optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and it revealed a patch of abnormally dilated, hyperfluorescent vessels at the level of the outer retina in your right eye. Patient: Is there any connection to other health issues? Doctor: We've ruled out clinical manifestations of systemic Toxoplasma infection. There's no history of ocular trauma, comorbid condition, or any significant past medical and surgical history. There's also no history of drug use, allergies, addiction, or blood transfusion. How's your sleep? Patient: My sleep is normal, doctor. Doctor: That's good. We'll need to monitor your condition and discuss treatment options to address the choroidal neovascular membrane in your right eye. It's essential to attend follow-up appointments to track your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything, doctor. I'll make sure to attend my follow-up appointments.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I'm a 53-year-old man who received a deceased donor kidney transplant 16 years ago due to hypertension. Recently, I've been experiencing redness, pain, and swelling in my left arm. Doctor: I see. Have you had any trauma to the area recently? Patient: No, nothing like that. But I was trimming shrubs and plants about a week ago. I've also had intermittent fever and chills lately. Doctor: Hmm, have you had any significant animal contact or recent travels? Patient: No, not at all. Doctor: What medications are you taking currently? Patient: I'm on cyclosporine and mycophenolate for immunosuppression, but I haven't used any corticosteroids recently. Doctor: Okay, let's evaluate your condition. Your temperature is 100.3 °F, heart rate is 99 beats/min, respiration is 20 cycles/min, and blood pressure is 109/71 mmHg. Upon skin examination, I see erythema, tenderness, and swelling on the medial aspect of your left arm and forearm. You also have a wound on your left forearm, which you think might have been due to an insect bite or an injury related to your recent gardening? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: I also noticed an old unused dialysis graft on your forearm, which seems to be unaffected. There's no significant lymph node enlargement and the examination of your other systems is completely unremarkable. We'll perform an ultrasound imaging of your left arm to get a better understanding of your condition. *After the ultrasound* Doctor: The ultrasound shows hypoechoic, tubular type structures in the subcutaneous fat, the largest measuring 8 × 5 mm, which is consistent with an abscess. We also took two views of your chest radiograph, which was normal. Patient: Okay, what's the next step? Doctor: You will undergo incision and drainage of the long abscess tract, which measures approximately 35 cm. Frank purulent drainage will be expressed from the tract and sent for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures. In the meantime, we'll start you on empirical intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin while awaiting the culture results. We're considering sporotrichosis as a strong differential, but we'll defer antifungal therapy until the culture results are available. Patient: Alright. What were the significant laboratory findings? Doctor: Your white blood cell count is 12.2 × 109/L, and your blood urea nitrogen is 56 mg/dL. Patient: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll keep monitoring your condition and adjust the treatment accordingly. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, please tell me about the incident that brought you here today. Patient: Well, I'm a 40-year-old construction worker, and about a week ago, I slipped and fell from a height of 3 meters. I got a deep penetrating wound on the right side of my neck when I fell on a sharp piece of iron rod. Doctor: That sounds very painful. How did you manage the injury at the scene? Patient: I quickly pulled the iron rod out when I got up from the floor. The bleeding wasn't too bad, and it stopped by the time I got to the local hospital. Doctor: I see. Did you experience any hemiplegia, paraplegia, or quadriplegia after the accident? Patient: No, I didn't have any of those issues. Doctor: Good. Are you known to be hypertensive, and did you consume any alcohol prior to the fall? Patient: No, I'm not hypertensive, and I didn't have any alcohol before the fall. I do drink occasionally, though. Doctor: Noted. Have you had any previous accidents or injuries? Patient: Yes, I had a left femoral fracture at the age of 24 and a right femoral fracture at the age of 32. Both were treated successfully with surgery. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Now, let me examine you. [After examination] You appear to be conscious, alert, and acutely ill with your neck in a cervical collar. Your general and neurological examinations are normal, including your pupils' reaction to light and cranial nerves. Your limb strength and reflexes are also normal. Your digital rectal examination shows a normal spinster tone. Additionally, your ECG, CXR, and other routine lab tests are normal. Patient: That's a relief. Doctor: However, the neck CT-scan done at the local hospital revealed fractures on the right side of your C2-C4 transverse processes, a fracture at the right lamina of C3, and a dissection of your right common carotid artery. The CT-scan of your head showed no abnormalities. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We also performed a three-dimensional reconstruction plain and enhanced scan imaging of your cervical spine, chest, and abdomen. It revealed two segmental stenoses of your right common carotid artery. Patient: What does that mean for me, doc? Doctor: It means that we need to closely monitor your condition and plan the appropriate treatment for your fractures and artery dissection. We'll discuss your options with you and ensure that you receive the best possible care. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient is a 40-year-old male construction worker who reports a fall from a height of 3 meters one week ago, resulting in a deep penetrating wound on the right side of his neck from a sharp iron rod. He self-extracted the rod and the bleeding ceased by the time he reached the hospital. He denies any symptoms of hemiplegia, paraplegia, or quadriplegia post-accident. The patient denies hypertension and alcohol consumption prior to the accident but admits to occasional drinking. He has a history of two femoral fractures requiring surgical intervention. O: Physical examination shows the patient is conscious, alert, and acutely ill with a cervical collar in place. General and neurological examinations are normal, including pupil reaction, cranial nerve function, limb strength, and reflexes. Digital rectal examination shows normal sphincter tone. Routine labs, ECG, and CXR are normal. CT scans from the local hospital show fractures on the right C2-C4 transverse processes, a fracture at the right lamina of C3, and a dissection of the right common carotid artery, with no head abnormalities. Further imaging revealed two segmental stenoses of the right common carotid artery. A: The primary diagnosis is traumatic injury to the cervical spine and right common carotid artery, including fractures of the C2-C4 transverse processes and right lamina of C3, and dissection with stenosis of the right common carotid artery. Differential diagnoses would consider other vascular injuries or complications from the neck trauma. P: The management plan will include close monitoring of the patient's neurological status and vascular integrity. Consultation with neurosurgery and vascular surgery is necessary to evaluate the need for surgical intervention or stenting. Pain management, maintenance of cervical spine stabilization, and anticoagulation therapy will be initiated.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you presented to the ED with a 24-hour history of nausea, diarrhoea, lack of appetite, and abdominal pain. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really sick for the past day. I've had nausea, diarrhoea, and I just can't eat anything. The pain in my stomach is mostly on the right side. Doctor: Thank you for that information. We detected SARS-CoV-2 from the PCR of your NP swab. When you came to the ED, we noted pain and tenderness on the right side of your abdomen during the examination. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We performed an abdominal ultrasound, and the findings were consistent with acute complicated appendicitis. To treat this, we started you on empiric IV antimicrobial treatment with cefotaxime and metronidazole. Patient: Okay, so that's to help with the appendicitis? Doctor: Yes, exactly. We also took you to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy to remove your inflamed appendix. Patient: Got it. And how did that go? Doctor: The surgery went well. We took an abdominal fluid culture during the procedure, which revealed E. coli. We admitted you to the hospital within the first 24 hours from the onset of your symptoms. Patient: I see. So, what now? Doctor: During the surgery, we found intraoperative findings of peritonitis and broad intra-abdominal inflammation. This may indicate that your acute COVID-19 infection could have sped up the disease course of your acute appendicitis. Patient: Oh, I didn't realize that could happen. Doctor: Yes, it's not very common, but it can occur. We will continue to monitor your recovery and adjust your treatment accordingly. It's important to follow up with us and let us know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to do that. Doctor: You're welcome. We're here to help you through your recovery. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. [/INST] S: The patient, a 24-year-old male, presented with a 24-hour history of nausea, diarrhea, lack of appetite, and right-sided abdominal pain. He reported feeling ""really sick"" and unable to eat. O: On examination in the ED, the patient exhibited right-sided abdominal pain and tenderness. A PCR test of an NP swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed acute complicated appendicitis. During laparoscopic appendectomy, intraoperative findings included peritonitis and broad intra-abdominal inflammation. Abdominal fluid culture grew E. coli. A: The primary diagnosis is acute complicated appendicitis, exacerbated by a concurrent acute COVID-19 infection. The presence of peritonitis and intra-abdominal inflammation suggests a severe infection, potentially accelerated by COVID-19. P: The patient was started on empiric IV antimicrobial treatment with cefotaxime and metronidazole and underwent a successful laparoscopic appendectomy. Post-operative management includes continued monitoring of recovery and adjustment of treatment based on clinical progress. The patient is advised to follow up regularly and report any new or worsening symptoms. Further consultations with infectious disease specialists may be necessary to manage the COVID-19 aspect and its interaction with the appendicitis. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been having some issues with my bowel movement lately. It's been really painful and seems to be obstructing. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. When did this start happening? Patient: It started around May this year. Doctor: Considering your symptoms, we decided to perform an emergency surgery called left hemicolectomy in May. The examination of the tissue revealed a well-to-moderately differentiated, type 2, intermediate-type tubular adenocarcinoma measuring 70 × 40 mm in your descending colon. The lesion was associated with serosal invasion (pSE), an infiltrative growth pattern (INFβ), moderate lymphatic invasion (ly2), and moderate venous invasion (v2). There was no involvement of the proximal margin (pPM0, 150 mm), no distant metastasis (pDM0, 120 mm), and no lymph node metastasis (0/27). A liver biopsy revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma, indicating colon cancer with liver metastasis. Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What does this mean for me? Doctor: It means that you have advanced colon cancer that has spread to your liver. We need to start treatment as soon as possible. Before we discuss treatment options, can you tell me about your medical history? Patient: I had a gastric ulcer back in 2003. I don't have any personal or family history of kidney disease, autoimmune disease, or asthma. I work in an office, smoke about five cigarettes a day for 50 years, and drink alcohol socially. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. One month after your surgery, we started hepatic arterial infusion therapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) from June to October 2007. Then, you received five courses of simplified l-leucovorin plus 5-FU (sLVFU). However, you had strangulating intestinal obstruction and underwent another emergency surgery in January 2008.  Patient: Yes, I remember that. What happened after that? Doctor: We started second-line treatment with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) in October 2008, but it was terminated in May 2009 due to renewed progression. From June 2009, you received third-line treatment with modified leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin regimen (mFOLFOX-6) plus bevacizumab. Patient: Did that help with my condition? Doctor: Unfortunately, a computed tomography (CT) scan in June 2010 showed progression of liver metastasis again. As you have already been treated with combination chemotherapies like FOLFIRI and mFOLFOX-6 and considering the wild-type RAS status of your primary tumor, we decided to start you on bi-weekly treatment. Patient: I see. What's the next step for me? Doctor: We will closely monitor your condition and make adjustments to your treatment as needed. It's important to maintain regular check-ups and communicate any changes in your symptoms to us. Also, try to maintain a healthy lifestyle and consider quitting smoking, as it may help improve your overall health. Patient: Thank you for explaining everything to me. I will do my best to follow your advice and stay in touch with any updates. Doctor: You're welcome. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help you through this journey. [/INST] S: The patient reports painful and obstructive bowel movements starting in May of the current year. He has a history of gastric ulcer in 2003, smokes five cigarettes daily for 50 years, and drinks alcohol socially.

O: The patient underwent a left hemicolectomy in May, revealing a well-to-moderately differentiated, type 2, intermediate-type tubular adenocarcinoma (70 × 40 mm) in the descending colon with serosal invasion, moderate lymphatic and venous invasion, but no lymph node or distant metastasis. A liver biopsy confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma. Post-operative treatments included hepatic arterial infusion therapy with 5-FU, sLVFU, FOLFIRI, and mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab. A CT scan in June 2010 showed progression of liver metastasis. The patient's primary tumor has a wild-type RAS status. A: The primary diagnosis is advanced colon cancer with liver metastasis. The patient has undergone multiple lines of chemotherapy with evidence of disease progression. The prognosis is guarded due to the advanced stage of cancer and the presence of liver metastasis. P: Continue bi-weekly treatment with close monitoring of the patient's condition. Regular check-ups are essential to track any changes or progression of the disease. Lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, are recommended to potentially improve overall health.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented to our hospital with the chief complaint of hematochezia and malaise. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've had fresh bloody stools twice. Once on the day of admission and another time 10 days earlier. I've been feeling really weak too. Doctor: I understand. Have you had any previous surgeries or medical issues? Patient: Yes, I had open surgery for an AAA 20 months ago. Doctor: Alright, thank you for the information. We conducted a computed tomography (CT) scan and an abdominal examination. There was nothing remarkable and no tenderness. Your blood pressure is 122/75 mmHg, heart rate is 86/minute, body temperature is 36.6 °C, breathing rate is 16 per minute, and your hemoglobin level is 9.0 g/dL. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: We also performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and total colonoscopy to investigate the bleeding. They revealed colon diverticula but no source of the bleeding. Patient: So, what's next? Doctor: The contrast-enhanced CT scan showed gas within the aneurysm sac and adhesion between the graft and the intestinal tract in three areas. There was an adhesion between the ileum and the anastomosis of the left branch of the graft and left common iliac artery, the jejunum to the middle of the graft body, and the duodenum to the anastomosis between the aorta and the proximal graft. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Enterococcus faecium was isolated from your blood culture, which suggests communication between the intestinal tract and aorta at the attached sites, possibly due to an infection of the graft. Your vital signs are stable, so we will schedule surgery after treating you with antibiotics. Patient: Alright, I hope that works. Doctor: After admission, you produced another fresh bloody stool, but the bleeding ceased immediately. However, 18 days after the second fresh bloody stool, you suddenly went into a state of shock, experienced massive fresh bloody stool and hematemesis, and then went into cardiac arrest. Patient: What happened next? Doctor: Despite intensive cardiopulmonary resuscitation, unfortunately, you passed away due to hemorrhagic shock. An autopsy was performed with consent from your family. Patient's Family: What did the autopsy reveal? Doctor: The autopsy revealed an ulcerative fistula in the distal ileum that adhered to the anastomosis between the left branch of the graft and the left common iliac artery. This was the cause of the severe bleeding and subsequent complications. Our deepest condolences to your family. [/INST] S: The patient reported experiencing hematochezia and malaise, with two episodes of fresh bloody stools, one on the day of admission and another 10 days earlier. The patient also felt weak and had a history of open surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) 20 months prior. O: Vital signs were stable with blood pressure at 122/75 mmHg, heart rate at 86/minute, body temperature at 36.6 °C, and breathing rate at 16 per minute. Hemoglobin was low at 9.0 g/dL (normal range: 13.8-17.2 g/dL for men, 12.1-15.1 g/dL for women). CT scans and endoscopic examinations showed colon diverticula but no active bleeding source. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed gas within the aneurysm sac and adhesions between the graft and the intestinal tract. Blood cultures isolated Enterococcus faecium, indicating possible graft infection. The patient experienced a massive hemorrhagic event leading to cardiac arrest and was declared deceased post-resuscitation efforts. A: The primary diagnosis was a graft infection leading to an ulcerative fistula between the graft and the intestinal tract, specifically the distal ileum, which caused severe bleeding and hemorrhagic shock. Differential diagnosis initially included colon diverticula as a potential source of bleeding. P: The management plan included stabilization with antibiotics targeting Enterococcus faecium and monitoring in a critical care setting. Surgical intervention was planned to address the graft infection and adhesions. Post-mortem, the family was informed about the autopsy results, which confirmed the cause of death and the source of bleeding. Bereavement support and counseling were offered to the family. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been having some swelling below my tongue and pain during meals. Doctor: I see. Let's do an examination to find out what's causing the issue.  Patient: Okay. Doctor: *After examining* I can feel a hard swelling on the left submandibular gland duct. We will need to take an occlusal radiograph to confirm what's causing the swelling. Patient: Sure, let's do that. Doctor: *After taking radiograph* The radiograph confirms that there is radio-opacity medial to teeth 46 and 47. I have diagnosed the swelling as left submandibular salivary gland duct sialolithiasis, which means you have a stone in your salivary gland duct. Patient: Oh, I see. So what's the next step? Doctor: We will perform a minor procedure to remove the stone while you are under local anesthesia. We will place a stay suture to prevent the stone from gliding posteriorly, then make an incision over the stone to expose the calculi and facilitate its removal.

Doctor: That's good to hear. We'll need to look into her medical history and perform some tests to determine the cause of the seizure.  Patient: Alright. So, what did you find out? Doctor: After reviewing her history and conducting further tests, we diagnosed her with insulinoma and hyperparathyroidism in MEN-1. A computed tomography scan showed a vascularity-rich tumor, 20 mm in diameter, located in the head of her pancreas. Patient: Oh no. What does that mean? Doctor: It means that there's a tumor in her pancreas which might be causing her symptoms. We also checked the feeding artery of the tumor but it wasn't clearly demonstrated through angiography and selective arterial calcium injection. Patient: What are the next steps? Doctor: We are considering extended surgical procedures like pancreatoduodenectomy, depending on the intraoperative findings. We will be performing open abdominal surgery rather than laparoscopic surgery to address this issue. Patient: What about her parathyroid hormone levels? Doctor: Her intact parathyroid hormone level is 66.0 pg/ml, which is slightly elevated, and her adjusted serum calcium level is 10.3 mg/dL. However, the parathyroid ultrasound examination didn't reveal any parathyroid tumor. Patient: Are there any other tumors? Doctor: We didn't detect any other tumors associated with MEN-1 in her case. The results of other preoperative examinations were unremarkable. Patient: What about her blood glucose management during surgery? Doctor: We inserted an Enlite™ sensor of MiniMed™ 620G Diabetes SCGM system into her upper arm the day before surgery. Although it's combined with an insulin pump, we didn't use the pump. The system was calibrated using a OneTouch® UltraVue™ Blood Glucose Meter from Johnson & Johnson. Patient: Okay, and what about premedication? Doctor: No premedication was given, and she walked into the operating room. Her capillary BG was 80 mg/dL and the SCGM system was calibrated. We started continuous glucose infusion during the procedure. Patient: Thank you for explaining everything. We appreciate your help and guidance during this difficult time. [/INST] S: The patient, a 12-year-old female, presented with a recent history of a seizure and loss of consciousness. She was treated with glucose and regained consciousness. There were no significant comorbidities reported prior to this incident. O: The patient was diagnosed with insulinoma and hyperparathyroidism as part of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1). CT scan revealed a 20 mm vascularity-rich tumor in the head of the pancreas. Her intact parathyroid hormone level was slightly elevated at 66.0 pg/ml (normal range: 15-65 pg/ml), and her adjusted serum calcium level was 10.3 mg/dL (normal range: 8.5-10.2 mg/dL). Parathyroid ultrasound did not show any tumors. No other tumors associated with MEN-1 were detected. Preoperative examinations were otherwise unremarkable. Continuous glucose monitoring was set up with an Enlite™ sensor, and her capillary blood glucose was 80 mg/dL before surgery. A: Primary diagnosis is insulinoma associated with MEN-1, complicated by hyperparathyroidism. The presence of a pancreatic tumor likely explains the hypoglycemic seizure. The absence of additional MEN-1 related tumors and normal preoperative examinations are favorable, but the conditions require careful surgical and medical management. P: The management plan includes an extended surgical procedure, specifically a pancreatoduodenectomy, to address the pancreatic tumor. Open abdominal surgery is planned rather than laparoscopic surgery. Continuous glucose monitoring and infusion will be maintained during surgery to manage blood glucose levels. No premedication was administered prior to surgery. Further follow-up will be necessary to monitor her condition postoperatively and adjust her treatment plan as needed. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm reviewing your case and I see that you are a 28-year-old right-handed woman who has been experiencing a severe depressive episode. Can you tell me when you first started having these episodes? Patient: Yeah, my first depressive episode started about 10 years ago, and I also had panic attacks back then. Doctor: I see. It seems that since then, you've had alternating phases of depression and sporadic episodes of elation. This led to a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder-II. Have you noticed any pattern to your depressive episodes? Patient: Yes, they usually get worse during autumn or winter. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. I also noticed that you reported low consumption of alcohol in social circumstances and sporadic use of cannabis during your adolescence. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Now, regarding your eating disorder, it appears that you've been experiencing binging behaviors since your first diagnosis of depression. These behaviors seem to vary in intensity and severity. Can you tell me more about that? Patient: Sure. Binge eating tends to happen more during my depressive phases, like almost daily. I never had any compensatory behaviors though. Doctor: I understand. It seems that your first Binge Eating Disorder diagnosis was given at our center during your last depressive episode. You mentioned that you used to go out after dinner and buy and rapidly eat large amounts of high-fat food. This caused both physical and psychological distress. Is that still the case? Patient: Yes, that's still happening. Doctor: In your past, you've had various pharmacological therapies prescribed, including valproate, fluoxetine, citalopram, venlafaxine, and bupropione. Currently, you are on clomipramine (150 mg daily) and pregabalin (225 mg daily). How are these medications working for you? Patient: I'm still struggling with my depressive symptoms, to be honest. Doctor: I understand. Your depressive symptoms at baseline are indeed severe according to both MADRS and HAMD assessments. We will continue to monitor your progress and consider adjusting your medication if necessary. Please keep in touch with us and let us know if there are any changes in your condition or if you have any concerns. Patient: Okay, thank you for your help, Doctor. [/INST] S: The patient is a 28-year-old right-handed female with a history of Bipolar Disorder-II, first diagnosed 10 years ago, characterized by depressive episodes and sporadic elation. She reports that depressive episodes typically worsen during autumn and winter. The patient acknowledges low alcohol consumption and past sporadic cannabis use. She has a history of Binge Eating Disorder, with increased binge eating during depressive phases, and no compensatory behaviors. Current symptoms include severe depression and ongoing binge eating behaviors, despite pharmacological treatment. O: The patient is currently prescribed clomipramine 150 mg daily and pregabalin 225 mg daily. Previous medications include valproate, fluoxetine, citalopram, venlafaxine, and bupropione. Assessments using MADRS and HAMD indicate severe baseline depressive symptoms. A: Primary diagnosis is Bipolar Disorder-II with a current severe depressive episode. Secondary diagnosis includes Binge Eating Disorder. Differential diagnoses to consider could include Major Depressive Disorder and Seasonal Affective Disorder, given the seasonal pattern of her depressive episodes. The patient's response to current pharmacotherapy is suboptimal, indicating a need for reassessment of her treatment plan. P: Continue monitoring the patient's response to clomipramine and pregabalin. Consider psychiatric consultation for possible adjustment of her medication regimen. Psychotherapy, specifically Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), may be beneficial for managing her depressive symptoms and binge eating. Nutritional counseling should be considered to address her eating disorder. Regular follow-up appointments should be scheduled to assess progress and make necessary adjustments to her treatment plan. Encourage the patient to maintain a mood diary to better understand the patterns and triggers of her mood fluctuations and eating behaviors. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I understand you've been experiencing some shortness of breath and a progression of a mass in your right chest wall/breast area. Can you tell me more about it? Patient: Yes, I've had this mass since childhood, but it has been getting worse for several months now. It's become enlarged, firm, and tender to touch, and there are some overlying skin changes. Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any new masses or other symptoms? Patient: Yes, I've noticed a new mass in my right axilla and I've unintentionally lost 15 pounds over the past year. I've also had urinary retention and frequency for a few months. Doctor: Thank you for the information. During your physical examination, we found a large 4-cm firm, fixed right breast mass with skin thickening and retraction. We also observed firm right axillary lymphadenopathy, diminished right-sided breath sounds in your right lung field, and prominence of your left breast. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We performed an admission chest X-ray and found complete opacification of your right lung, which is compatible with a large pleural effusion. We also conducted a computed tomography scan of your chest, which revealed a 6 to 7 cm mass in your right breast with right axillary adenopathy, a large right pleural effusion, and a 7-mm soft tissue nodule at the left lung base. Patient: What about the mammography? Doctor: The mammography couldn't assess your right breast due to the inability to obtain adequate compression. However, it did reveal marked gynecomastia of your left breast.  Patient: So what did you do next? Doctor: You underwent a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis. The pleural fluid studies were consistent with an exudative effusion. The cytology results showed metastatic adenocarcinoma of breast primary. Patient: Oh no, that's terrible news. Doctor: I'm sorry to inform you of this. We also performed an ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the right breast mass. The pathology results revealed invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2, and positive for estrogen receptor (ER) 90%, progesterone receptor (PR) 1% to 5%, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive. Patient: What does all that mean for me? Doctor: It means that your cancer is aggressive and has spread to other areas of your body. We will need to discuss treatment options and next steps with you, and you may want to involve your family in these discussions as well. Our team is here to support you through this difficult time. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll talk to my family and get back to you about the next steps. [/INST] S: The patient reports a longstanding mass in the right chest wall/breast area, which has recently become enlarged, firm, and tender with overlying skin changes. Additionally, the patient has noticed a new mass in the right axilla, unintentional weight loss of 15 pounds over the past year, and symptoms of urinary retention and frequency. O: Physical examination revealed a 4-cm firm, fixed right breast mass with skin thickening and retraction, firm right axillary lymphadenopathy, and diminished right-sided breath sounds. Chest X-ray showed complete opacification of the right lung, suggestive of a large pleural effusion. CT scan confirmed a 6-7 cm right breast mass with right axillary adenopathy, a large right pleural effusion, and a 7-mm soft tissue nodule at the left lung base. Mammography indicated marked gynecomastia of the left breast but was inconclusive for the right breast. Diagnostic thoracentesis indicated an exudative effusion with cytology confirming metastatic adenocarcinoma of breast origin. Ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the right breast mass identified invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2, ER 90%, PR 1%-5%, HER2 positive. A: The primary diagnosis is metastatic breast cancer, specifically invasive ductal carcinoma with involvement of the right breast, right axilla, and pleural cavity. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of metastatic cancer or primary pleural diseases, but these are less likely given the biopsy results and imaging findings. P: The management plan will include multidisciplinary consultation involving oncology, surgery, and possibly radiation oncology for comprehensive cancer treatment. The patient will be started on targeted therapy based on the hormone receptor status, and chemotherapy will be considered to address systemic disease. Supportive care for symptoms like pain and urinary issues will be provided, and a social worker will be involved to assist with psychological support and logistics. The patient will be educated about the nature of the disease, treatment options, and potential outcomes to ensure informed decision-making. Family involvement in discussions about care and treatment planning is encouraged to provide additional support. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you were admitted to Shandong Sunshine Union Hospital on November 10, 2017, due to chest tightness and breathing shortness after activity for 1 year and coughing for 2 months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, I started having chest tightness and breathing shortness after general physical activity about a year ago. And I've been coughing, mostly dry coughs, for the past 2 months. Doctor: Have you noticed anything else related to your cough? Patient: A small amount of white sputum comes out after a severe cough, and it gets worse at night but lighter during the daytime. Doctor: I see. You were diagnosed with ""severe aortic stenosis"" using color Doppler echocardiography. The diagnosis of ""severe aortic stenosis (bicuspid deformity) and left ventricular outflow tract stenosis"" was then confirmed using transthoracic echocardiography. Do you have any history of medical conditions? Patient: Yes, I have a history of hypertension for 10 years, and I usually take antihypertensive drugs to control my blood pressure. Doctor: Your physical examination revealed a clear respiratory sound of bilateral lungs without rhonchus and moist rales, and a systolic 3/6 grade murmur in the third intercostals of the left border of sternum. The liver was not enlarged and there was no swelling in both lower extremities. The laboratory examination of brain natriuretic peptide was normal. Patient: Okay, so what did the other tests show? Doctor: Transthoracic echocardiography showed asymmetric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with a maximum thickness of 20 mm, the diameter of the left ventricular outflow tract of 13 mm, and the anterior flow velocity of the aortic valve of 4.3 m/s. Patient: And what about the Cardiac MRI? Doctor: The Cardiac MRI revealed myocardial hypertrophy, left ventricular outflow tract stenosis, aortic stenosis, and bicuspid deformity, which indicated the requirement of aortic valve replacement and left ventricular outflow tract dredging. Patient: So what happened during the surgery? Doctor: Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography showed aortic stenosis and left ventricular outflow tract stenosis. However, the aortic valve was found to be normal without stenosis or insufficiency. The asymmetrically hypertrophic myocardium under the aortic valve caused left ventricular outflow tract stenosis, so the diagnosis was changed to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Patient: Oh, I see. So what's the plan now? Doctor: With this new diagnosis, we will adjust your treatment plan accordingly. This might include medication adjustments and close monitoring of your condition. It's important to continue taking your antihypertensive drugs to control your blood pressure and follow up with your healthcare team regularly. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. I'll make sure to follow your advice. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Take care! [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing chest tightness and shortness of breath after physical activity for approximately one year and a dry cough for the past two months, occasionally producing a small amount of white sputum, worsening at night. The patient has a 10-year history of hypertension, managed with antihypertensive medication. O: Physical examination revealed clear bilateral lung sounds, no rhonchus or moist rales, and a systolic 3/6 grade murmur at the left sternal border. No liver enlargement or lower extremity swelling was noted. Laboratory tests showed normal brain natriuretic peptide levels. Transthoracic echocardiography indicated severe left ventricular hypertrophy with a maximum thickness of 20 mm, a narrowed left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) diameter of 13 mm, and an increased anterior flow velocity across the aortic valve at 4.3 m/s. Cardiac MRI confirmed myocardial hypertrophy, LVOT stenosis, aortic stenosis, and a bicuspid aortic valve. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography during valve surgery revealed the primary issue to be hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), not aortic stenosis. A: The primary diagnosis is hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, initially misdiagnosed as severe aortic stenosis with bicuspid deformity. Differential diagnosis included aortic stenosis, which was ruled out intraoperatively. P: The treatment plan includes adjustment of current medications, continued use of antihypertensive drugs to manage hypertension, and regular follow-up with the healthcare team to monitor the progression of HOCM. The patient is advised to maintain close communication with healthcare providers and report any new symptoms or concerns. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I'm a 50-year-old female with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. I've been receiving pembrolizumab treatment for my PD-L1+ cancer, and I've noticed some petechiae after the third cycle. Doctor: I see. Pembrolizumab is an anti-PD-1 treatment, which can sometimes cause hematologic irAEs like autoimmune hemolytic anemia, acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and acquired hemophilia. Thrombocytopenia is relatively infrequent, affecting between 1 to 28% of patients. Let's discuss your symptoms and medical history to determine what might be causing your petechiae. Patient: Okay, sure. Doctor: Have you had any recent drug or toxin exposures, or viral infections that you're aware of? Patient: No, I don't think so. Doctor: Alright. We'll need to consider other causes for your thrombocytopenia during your ICI therapy, such as bone marrow suppression, infiltration, platelet destruction, or platelet sequestration. We should also evaluate the possibilities of myelodysplastic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, ICI-mediated thrombocytopenia, acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenia (TTP), and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Your CBC results showed normal hemoglobin with grade 2 thrombocytopenia - your platelet count is 70,000/μl. Your renal function is normal, and there's no evidence of platelet consumption or hemolysis on your peripheral blood smear. Hemolysis labs, including serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, and CBC, were all normal. You've also tested negative for HIV, hepatitis B/C virus, and H. pylori. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is ICI-mediated immune thrombocytopenia. We decided to hold your ICI treatment for 2 weeks, and a repeat CBC showed no improvement in your platelet count until we started you on prednisone at 1 mg/kg/dose. At your 2-week re-evaluation, your platelet count improved to 90,000/μl, which is grade 1 thrombocytopenia. Patient: Oh, that sounds better. Doctor: Yes, it is an improvement. We're going to taper your prednisone dosage over the next 4 weeks, and then you should be able to recommence pembrolizumab treatment. Most patients with low-grade thrombocytopenia improve with ICI withholding and initiation of oral corticosteroids like prednisone. Patient: That's good to know. Doctor: However, if you experience higher-grade toxicities, we will involve a hematology service for further evaluation and management. It's essential to monitor your condition and report any new or worsening symptoms promptly. Patient: Alright, I understand. Thank you for the information and help, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care, and I'll see you at your next appointment. [/INST] S: 50-year-old female with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, PD-L1+, currently on pembrolizumab, reports petechiae after the third cycle of treatment. Denies recent drug or toxin exposures, viral infections. No improvement in platelet count after holding ICI treatment, but improvement noted with prednisone initiation. O: Vital signs stable. CBC shows normal hemoglobin, grade 2 thrombocytopenia with platelet count at 70,000/μl, improving to 90,000/μl (grade 1) after prednisone treatment. Renal function normal. No evidence of platelet consumption or hemolysis on peripheral blood smear. Hemolysis labs including LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin normal. Negative for HIV, hepatitis B/C, H. pylori. A: Primary diagnosis of ICI-mediated immune thrombocytopenia. Differential diagnoses considered included bone marrow suppression, myelodysplastic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic uremic syndrome, but less likely given lab findings and clinical presentation. P: Hold pembrolizumab treatment temporarily. Initiate prednisone at 1 mg/kg/dose, with a plan to taper over 4 weeks. Monitor platelet count and general condition closely. Plan to recommence pembrolizumab if condition stabilizes with low-grade thrombocytopenia. Refer to hematology if higher-grade toxicities develop. Patient education on symptom monitoring and prompt reporting of new or worsening symptoms. Follow-up appointment scheduled to reassess condition and treatment efficacy. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you have been referred to our clinic because you've developed some pallor and vision field loss in your left eye. Can you tell me more about when this started? Patient: Yes, it started a few months ago. I noticed that my vision in my left eye was getting worse, and it seemed a bit pale. Doctor: I understand. Based on the information provided, you are a 65-year-old hyperopic female. Your best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is 1.0 with correction of +4.5 DSph in your right eye and 0.5+ with correction of +4.5 DSph in your left eye. Your intraocular pressure (IOP) is 15 mmHg in your right eye and 16 mmHg in your left eye. We performed a gonioscopy and found that your angle is narrow (I/II deg.), but neither acute nor prodromal glaucoma were confirmed. Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for me? Doctor: Since glaucoma was not confirmed, we performed an MR to investigate further. The MR revealed a left optic nerve sheath meningioma, which is a tumor. It measures 11 x 12 x 7 mm and is involving your optic nerve canal. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it is a serious condition. However, the tumor was totally removed by a left craniotomy, and the pathology report confirmed a diagnosis of psammomatous meningioma. You are now stable and being continuously observed.  Patient: That's a relief. How is my vision now? Doctor: Your BCVA 2 years after the surgery is the same as before, 1.0 in your right eye and 0.4 in your left eye. We will continue to monitor your condition.  Patient: I appreciate that. Can you explain more about the angle closure you mentioned earlier? Doctor: Certainly. The suspicion of acute angle closure in the past could have potentially delayed the MR. After an acute angle closure in the optic disc, more pallor than cupping may be observed. However, in your case, the MR was performed, and the meningioma was discovered and treated promptly. Patient: I see. I'm glad it was caught in time. What do I need to do for follow-up care? Doctor: You will need to come in for regular checkups so we can monitor your condition and ensure that there are no further complications. It's important to report any changes in your vision, as well. Patient: Alright, I will make sure to do that. Thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. Take care! [/INST] S: The patient, a 65-year-old hyperopic female, reports progressive vision loss and pallor in the left eye starting a few months ago. She has a history of suspected acute angle closure, which was later ruled out. O: Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is 1.0 in the right eye and 0.4 in the left eye with a correction of +4.5 DSph for both eyes. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is 15 mmHg in the right eye and 16 mmHg in the left eye. Gonioscopy shows a narrow angle (I/II deg.). MR imaging revealed a left optic nerve sheath meningioma measuring 11 x 12 x 7 mm, which was surgically removed via left craniotomy. Pathology confirmed psammomatous meningioma. A: The primary diagnosis is left optic nerve sheath meningioma, post-surgical status with stable condition. The differential diagnosis initially included acute angle closure glaucoma, which was ruled out. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the successful removal of the meningioma, but ongoing monitoring is required due to potential vision changes or tumor recurrence. P: The patient will continue with regular follow-up appointments to monitor her vision and any potential recurrence of the meningioma. She is advised to report any new changes in vision immediately. Further education on symptoms of meningioma recurrence and the importance of regular ophthalmic evaluations will be provided during follow-up visits. </s>"

Doctor: And if I recall correctly, your first baby was induced owing to intrauterine fetal death, but the details were unknown? Mother: Yes, unfortunately, we still don't know why it happened. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. There's no family history of congenital abnormalities on either side of the family, right? Mother: No, there isn't. Doctor: And you and your husband are not related, and you don't have any history of tobacco, alcohol, or substance abuse? Mother: No, we are not related, and I have never smoked or used any drugs. Doctor: That's good to hear. During your pregnancy, you had gestational diabetes, correct? Your blood glucose was maintained between 6.1 mmol/l and 8.1 mmol/l without any drug treatment? Mother: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Your baby was delivered at a gestational age of 37 weeks and 3 days by vaginal delivery, correct? Mother: Yes, that's right. Doctor: And the newborn's weight was 4910 grams, with Apgar scores of 6 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively? Mother: Yes. Doctor: I see. After the birth, the baby experienced dyspnea, and we noticed a perineal defect during the examination in the NICU. It's a moist red sulcus, about 1 cm long, 0.1 cm wide, and 0.1 cm deep, extending vertically downward from the base of the vaginal fourchette to the anterior rim of the anus at the 12 o'clock position. There are no signs of malformation, bleeding, infection, or other complications in the genital area. Mother: Oh, I see. Is that something to be concerned about? Doctor: It's not an immediate concern, but we will keep an eye on it. During the baby's admission, she had normal excretory functions. Her vital signs were as follows: temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 110 beats/min, respiratory rate of 65 breaths/min, and blood pressure of 75/39 mmHg. Mother: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Doctor: We have diagnosed the baby with asphyxia neonatorum, neonatal wet lung disease, fetal macrosomia, cephalohematoma of the newborn, PDA, myocardial injury, and congenital perineal groove. She is also considered a neonate of a diabetic mother. Mother: Oh, that sounds worrisome. What do we need to do now?

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented with urosepsis and acute urinary retention. Can you tell me about your history of urinary symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've had hesitancy and frequency for a long time, and I've recently had abdominal pain and hematuria for about a week. Doctor: I understand that attempts to place a transurethral catheter failed, so a supra-pubic catheter was inserted. We've treated you for urosepsis with intravenous ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam in the intensive care unit, and you've shown clinical improvement. Can you tell me about your past medical history? Patient: I've had infertility and an unknown abdominal surgical procedure when I was very young. I started puberty at 14, and I had normal sexual activity and regular erections up to two months before coming here. Doctor: Our urology service attempted a bedside cystoscopy, which demonstrated a normal distal urethra and obliteration of the entire lumen on entrance into the bulbar urethra. We also performed a computed tomography (CT) scan that showed bilateral adrenal masses consistent with myolipomas, unchanged in size from a 2001 CT scan, and an enlarged pelvic mass arising from what was thought to be the adnexa compressing the urinary bladder. Upon physical examination, we noted hypospadias and absent testicles. Do you have any information about the unknown procedure you had as a child? Patient: No, I don't have any further information, and I never had any follow-up. Doctor: Based on these clinical and radiographic findings, we conducted karyotype testing during your admission and found that you have a mosaic 45,X/47,XXX/46 XX karyotype. Due to the abnormal laboratory values, the endocrinology service was consulted, and you've been diagnosed with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) due to 11-hydroxylase deficiency. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: Your lab values confirmed the diagnosis of 11-hydroxylase deficiency, showing elevated estradiol, testosterone, androstenedione, dihydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS), 11-deoxycortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This means that your body has difficulty properly producing certain hormones, which can result in various symptoms and health issues. Patient: What can I do about it? Doctor: We will work closely with the endocrinology service to determine the best course of treatment for you. This may include medications to help regulate your hormone levels and address any related symptoms. It's important that you attend regular follow-up appointments to monitor your condition and adjust treatment as needed. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything. I'll make sure to follow up with the endocrinology service and attend my appointments. [/INST] S: The patient reports a long history of urinary hesitancy and frequency, recent abdominal pain, and hematuria for approximately one week. The patient has a past medical history of infertility and an unknown abdominal surgical procedure in childhood. The patient started puberty at 14 and had normal sexual activity and regular erections until two months ago. The patient has no further information about the childhood surgery and never had any follow-up. O: Physical examination revealed hypospadias and absent testicles. Failed transurethral catheter placement led to the insertion of a supra-pubic catheter. Bedside cystoscopy showed a normal distal urethra and obliteration of the entire lumen at the entrance into the bulbar urethra. CT imaging indicated bilateral adrenal masses consistent with myolipomas and an enlarged pelvic mass compressing the urinary bladder. Laboratory tests confirmed elevated levels of estradiol, testosterone, androstenedione, DHEAS, 11-deoxycortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and ACTH. Karyotype testing revealed a mosaic 45,X/47,XXX/46 XX karyotype. The patient was treated for urosepsis with intravenous ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam in the ICU and showed clinical improvement. A: The primary diagnosis is Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) due to 11-hydroxylase deficiency, complicated by urosepsis and acute urinary retention. Differential diagnoses initially included other forms of adrenal hyperplasia and potential complications from the unknown childhood surgical procedure. The prognosis depends on effective management of CAH and regular monitoring of hormone levels and adrenal function. P: The management plan includes continued collaboration with the endocrinology service to regulate hormone levels using appropriate medications. The patient is advised to attend regular follow-up appointments to monitor the condition and adjust treatment as necessary. Education regarding the importance of compliance with the treatment regimen and follow-up is crucial. Referrals to urology for management of urinary symptoms and potential surgical consultation for the pelvic mass are also planned. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, what brings you in today? Patient: Hi, doctor. My 8-year-old son has been experiencing swelling in his upper right front tooth region for about a year now. Doctor: I see. Let me perform an extraoral examination to check the swelling. Hmm, there's slight swelling present on the right side of his face, causing elevation of the right ala of his nose. I'll also check for any general issues and facial asymmetry. The other findings appear to be noncontributory, and there's no history of trauma. We'll need to take a panoramic radiograph to get a better understanding of the issue. Patient: Okay, doctor. (After taking the radiograph) Doctor: The radiograph shows that your son has mixed dentition with tooth buds at different developmental stages. There's a large radiolucent lesion, about 2 x 2 cm in size, in the right side of his face area in relation to the periapical region of teeth 54 and 55. The tooth bud of tooth 14 is being pushed close to the region of the floor of the orbit, and the tooth bud of 15 is being pushed posteriorly. Patient: Oh, that sounds concerning. Doctor: Yes, the borders of the lesion are ill-defined. We also performed a coronal computed tomography, which showed a radiolucent lesion in relation to the right maxillary sinus area with the tooth bud being displaced close to the region below the floor of the orbit. Considering the clinical and radiologic presentations, we have determined a provisional diagnosis of a dentigerous cyst. Patient: What does that mean for my son? Doctor: It means that your son will need to undergo surgery to remove the cyst. The surgery will be performed under general anesthesia. During the procedure, a mucoperiosteal flap will be opened, and the entire cyst lining will be enucleated along with the fibrous capsule. The removed cyst will then be sent for histopathological examination. Patient: Alright, doctor. What were the results of the histopathological examination? Doctor: The histopathological examination revealed an odontogenic epithelial lining with a thickness of 6 to 9 cells, which exhibited a wavy appearance. The basal epithelial layer was composed of palisaded columnar cells. Additionally, there was the presence of small satellite cystic islands of odontogenic epithelium seen in the fibrous connective tissue. These findings are suggestive of a KCOT. Patient: So what does that mean for my son's condition? Doctor: KCOT, or keratocystic odontogenic tumor, is a benign but potentially aggressive jaw cyst. The good news is that it has been removed, and we will closely monitor your son's condition during follow-up visits to ensure there are no complications or recurrences. Patient: Thank you, doctor. We really appreciate your help and guidance. [/INST] S: The patient's mother reports that her 8-year-old son has been experiencing swelling in the upper right front tooth region for about a year. There is no history of trauma associated with the swelling. O: Physical examination revealed slight swelling on the right side of the face, elevating the right ala of the nose. Panoramic radiograph showed a large radiolucent lesion approximately 2 x 2 cm in size in the periapical region of teeth 54 and 55, with displacement of adjacent tooth buds. Coronal computed tomography confirmed the presence of a radiolucent lesion in relation to the right maxillary sinus area. Histopathological examination of the removed cyst showed an odontogenic epithelial lining with features suggestive of a keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT). A: The primary diagnosis is keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT), a benign but potentially aggressive jaw cyst. The lesion's ill-defined borders and the displacement of tooth buds were key factors leading to this diagnosis. P: The management plan included surgical removal of the cyst under general anesthesia, with enucleation of the cyst lining and fibrous capsule. The cyst was sent for histopathological examination to confirm the diagnosis. The patient will undergo regular follow-up visits to monitor for any complications or recurrence of the cyst. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, what brings you in today? Patient: Hi, I've been dealing with this non-healing ulcer on my left leg for over a year. It's causing me pain and swelling, and it hasn't really responded to any conventional treatment. Doctor: I see. Are you a smoker or drinker? Patient: No, I'm a non-smoker and non-drinker. Doctor: Okay. Have you had any history of trauma, varicose veins, or calf pain? Patient: No, but I do have a history of vascular disease. Doctor: Alright. Let me examine your leg. *Examines leg* I can see a single, irregular, large, almost rectangular shaped ulcer, about 6.8 x 4.3 cm in size. There's shiny granulation tissue on the surface and mild eczematous changes on the surrounding skin. I also noticed a moderate amount of purulent foul-smelling discharge from the wound, with surrounding edema. Does the pain worsen while walking? Patient: Yes, it does hurt more when I walk. Doctor: In that case, I'm going to refer you to the angiology service for wound management. They will help you with proper treatment for the ulcer. Patient: What kind of treatment can I expect? Doctor: They will likely prescribe a combination of anabolic and topical antimicrobial agents such as clostebol, neomycin, gentamicin, and silver sulphadiazine, as well as topical corticosteroids like betamethasone dipropionate. Debridement and dressing of the ulcer will also be done to promote healing. Patient: Okay, and what if the ulcer doesn't heal? Doctor: If the ulcer remains a recurrent chronic wound, the angiologist may prescribe a magistral formulation of a 2% Punica granatum peel ethanolic extract (PGMF) based on a hydrophilic cream and zinc oxide. This will be applied to the ulcer once a day after obtaining your written informed consent. Patient: Will I need any other treatments? Doctor: Along with the PGMF application, oral iron therapy and diuretics will be initiated. Tramadol will be prescribed as a pain reliever, but no antibiotics will be given during this course of treatment. Patient: What happens after the application? Doctor: After applying the PGMF, the ulcer will be dressed with cotton gauze. You should notice a significant decrease in the size of the ulcer within six weeks, and it should be completely healed six weeks later. Patient: That sounds promising. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. Let's get you referred to the angiology service and start the healing process. [/INST] S: Patient reports a non-healing ulcer on the left leg, present for over a year, causing pain and swelling.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've been referred here because of a 20-year history of intermittent headaches and dizziness, accompanied by blurred vision in both eyes for the past 10 years. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Do you have any family history of glaucoma? Patient: No, I don't. Doctor: Alright. We performed an ophthalmic examination, which showed that your best corrected visual acuity values were 0.8 and 0.5 in your eyes. The intraocular pressure was normal, but the superior visual field was narrowed in both eyes, likely due to drooping upper eyelids. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We also conducted a neurological examination. Your muscle strength and muscle tension in the limbs were normal, and Babinski's sign, Kernig's sign, and Brudzinski's sign were negative. Patient: Okay. Doctor: A CT scan and an MRI of the sella revealed a mass in the sellar-suprasellar-parasellar region. This mass is likely to be a meningioma, which compressed your left optic nerve. Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it is a serious condition. We performed a craniotomy using the anterior cranial base approach. During the operation, we opened the frontal sinus apex and found the tumor surrounding your left optic nerve, close to the internal carotid artery and the oculomotor nerve. Patient: Was the surgery successful? Doctor: Yes, the operation was successful. We removed as much of the tumor as possible, sealed the top of the frontal sinus with bone wax, and sutured the epidural. Patient: That's a relief. Doctor: A postoperative CT showed that the lesion in the saddle area had been removed, and a small amount of blood and effusion accumulated under the dural membrane of the left frontotemporal region. Patient: Oh, okay. Doctor: On the third day after the operation, you complained of swelling and pain in your left eye, accompanied by difficulty opening the left eyelid. Is that right? Patient: Yes, it's been very uncomfortable. Doctor: Our examination revealed proptosis with ptosis in the left eye, eyelid swelling, and increases in intraorbital pressure and intraocular pressure. Patient: What can be done about this? Doctor: We will monitor your condition closely and provide appropriate treatment to manage the swelling, pain, and pressure. It's important to follow up with us regularly to ensure your recovery goes smoothly. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient reports a 20-year history of intermittent headaches and dizziness, with blurred vision in both eyes for the past 10 years. The patient denies any family history of glaucoma. Postoperatively, the patient complains of swelling and pain in the left eye, difficulty opening the left eyelid, and discomfort. O: Ophthalmic examination revealed best corrected visual acuity of 0.8 and 0.5 in the eyes, normal intraocular pressure, and narrowed superior visual fields due to drooping upper eyelids. Neurological examination showed normal muscle strength and tension, with negative Babinski's, Kernig's, and Brudzinski's signs. CT and MRI identified a mass in the sellar-suprasellar-parasellar region compressing the left optic nerve. Post-craniotomy CT confirmed removal of the lesion with residual blood and effusion under the dural membrane of the left frontotemporal region. Recent examination indicated proptosis with ptosis in the left eye, eyelid swelling, and increased intraorbital and intraocular pressures. A: Primary diagnosis is a meningioma compressing the left optic nerve, with postoperative complications including proptosis, ptosis, and increased intraorbital and intraocular pressures. Differential diagnosis could include other causes of increased intraorbital pressure. P: Continue close monitoring of the patient's postoperative condition. Manage swelling, pain, and increased pressures with appropriate medications and interventions. Regular follow-ups are essential to assess recovery and manage any ongoing or new symptoms.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of psoriatic arthritis and you were referred to our hospital with fever, nausea, headache, asthenia, and visual disturbances. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. I've been feeling unwell since I competed in a triathlon four days ago. I've also been kayaking, cycling, and running in the forest for weeks before that. Doctor: I see. We've conducted a general clinical and neurological examination, and the results were normal. However, your blood analyses on admission showed some concerning results. Your C-reactive protein is increased at 247.9 mg/l, and you have mild thrombocytopenia with 74,000 platelets per microliter. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does that mean? Doctor: It indicates that there may be some inflammation or infection in your body. Additionally, four days later, we found high creatinine levels at 2.02 mg/dl, high urea levels at 66 mg/dl, and eosinophilia at 1600/μl. We performed an MRI of your brain due to your increasing headaches to rule out cerebral vein thrombosis. Patient: What did the MRI show? Doctor: The axial diffusion-weighted image showed a high signal intensity in the splenium of corpus callosum at high b-value (b = 1000 s/mm2) with low apparent diffusion coefficient values. The axial T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery images showed a slight hyperintense signal in the same location. However, there was no abnormal contrast enhancement or cerebral venous thrombosis. Patient: So, what does all that mean, doctor? Doctor: We detected anti-Puumala virus IgM antibodies in your blood using an enzyme immunoassay, which confirmed that you have an acute PUUV infection. This infection is likely the cause of your symptoms and the MRI findings. Patient: Oh, I see. What's the treatment plan for this infection? Doctor: You were discharged eight days after admission, and the MRI findings had resolved completely in a follow-up study three weeks later. The diagnosis is a cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum (CLOCC), which is related to the PUUV infection. Patient: So, is everything okay now? Do I need to do anything else? Doctor: Yes, it seems that your body has successfully fought off the infection, and the MRI findings have resolved completely. However, it's important to monitor your health closely and return for follow-up appointments as needed. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to keep an eye on my health and come back if I experience any issues. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns in the future. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of psoriatic arthritis, presented with fever, nausea, headache, asthenia, and visual disturbances following participation in a triathlon and other outdoor activities. Symptoms started four days post-triathlon. O: Clinical and neurological examinations were normal. Blood tests revealed elevated C-reactive protein at 247.9 mg/l (normal <5 mg/l), mild thrombocytopenia with platelets at 74,000/μl (normal 150,000-450,000/μl), increased creatinine levels at 2.02 mg/dl (normal 0.6-1.2 mg/dl), high urea levels at 66 mg/dl (normal 20-40 mg/dl), and eosinophilia at 1600/μl (normal 0-500/μl). MRI showed high signal intensity in the splenium of corpus callosum, consistent with cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum (CLOCC). Anti-Puumala virus IgM antibodies were positive, confirming acute PUUV infection. A: The primary diagnosis is acute PUUV infection, presenting with CLOCC secondary to the infection. Differential diagnoses initially considered included cerebral vein thrombosis and other systemic infections, which were ruled out by imaging and serological tests. P: The patient was treated supportively during hospitalization and monitored with follow-up MRI, which showed resolution of the CLOCC. The patient was advised to monitor health closely and return for follow-up appointments as needed, with emphasis on monitoring renal function and platelet count due to initial abnormalities. Education on PUUV infection and its transmission was provided to prevent future occurrences. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you've arrived at the emergency room. Can you please tell me what's bothering you? Patient: Hi, I've been having this intermittent pain on my right lower abdomen for about 36 hours now. I also lost my appetite, vomited a few times, and have a high-grade fever. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any pathological personal or family medical history that we should be aware of? Patient: No, not really. Doctor: Alright, let's examine your abdomen. *Examines right iliac fossa* It appears tender to palpation, but I don't see any peritoneal signs. We'll need to run some tests. *After tests* Doctor: Your initial laboratory evaluation showed leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and an elevated C-reactive protein. We also performed an ultrasonography of your abdomen, which revealed a 40x37mm heterogeneous lesion within the colon, no appendix, and some swollen mesenteric nodes of at least 10mm. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We needed more information, so we did an abdominal CT scan. The findings were suggestive of ileocolic intussusception with an invagination area of about 6.6x4.9cm. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It's a condition where part of the intestine slides into an adjacent part. After a surgical consult, you underwent an exploratory laparoscopy, which required laparotomy conversion. We found a well-defined, 5cm mass at the ileo cecal valve and multiple hard pericecal lymph nodes.  Patient: What happened next? Doctor: During the surgery, we observed preserved permeability between the ileum and colon, complete integrity of the cecum wall, and a lack of vermiform appendix. The possibility of an auto-digested appendix and a cecal tumor were discussed. The surgeons decided to resect the retrocecal and pericecal lymph nodes and send the samples to pathology before any further intervention. Patient: So, what's the plan now? Doctor: You were admitted to the inpatient floor, and we started antibiotic therapy based on ampicillin sulbactam and metronidazole. We consulted the oncology department, and they ordered some complementary laboratory exams, including liver and renal function tests, uric acid, electrolytes, lactic dehydrogenase, and quantiferon-TB tests. Only your lactic dehydrogenase was altered. Patient: Is there anything else I should know? Doctor: We also did a chest x-ray to rule out any mediastinal masses, and there were no alarming findings. However, on your second day of hospitalization, you presented with gastric distension, abdominal pain, and fever. The content inside your suprapubic JP drain changed from a serohematic aspect to a dense cloudy fluid. Patient: What will you do about that? Doctor: We collected a culture and performed a cytochemical analysis of the peritoneal fluid to better understand what's going on. We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan accordingly. Rest assured, we will do our best to help you recover. [/INST] S: The patient, a 34-year-old male, presented to the emergency room with a chief complaint of intermittent right lower abdominal pain for 36 hours, accompanied by loss of appetite, vomiting, and high-grade fever. He denies any significant personal or family medical history. O: Physical examination revealed tenderness in the right iliac fossa without peritoneal signs. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein. Abdominal ultrasonography identified a 40x37mm heterogeneous lesion within the colon, swollen mesenteric nodes, and absence of the appendix. CT scan suggested ileocolic intussusception. Exploratory laparoscopy, converted to laparotomy, revealed a 5cm mass at the ileocecal valve and multiple hard pericecal lymph nodes. Post-operative findings included altered lactic dehydrogenase levels, normal chest x-ray, and a change in JP drain content to dense cloudy fluid suggestive of infection. A: The primary diagnosis is ileocolic intussusception secondary to a possible cecal tumor. Differential diagnoses include infectious or inflammatory conditions given the leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers. The presence of a mass and lymphadenopathy raises concerns for malignancy. P: The patient underwent surgical intervention with lymph node resection and mass biopsy, pending pathology results. He was started on antibiotic therapy with ampicillin-sulbactam and metronidazole. Further evaluations by oncology and continued monitoring of liver and renal function, uric acid, electrolytes, and lactic dehydrogenase are planned. A culture and cytochemical analysis of the peritoneal fluid from the JP drain were initiated due to suspected infection. The treatment plan will be adjusted based on culture results and ongoing clinical assessment. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I'm here because I've been having these erythematous and desquamative papular eruptions on my face and genital region for about a year now. They're mostly around my mouth and eyes. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with these eruptions? Patient: No, not really. But the eruptions have caused me to feel very self-conscious, and I've been avoiding social situations like parties and school events because of them. Doctor: I understand. That must be very difficult for you. Have you tried any treatments for these eruptions? Patient: Yeah, we tried a bunch of things, like corticosteroids, imidazole, immunomodulators, and even antibiotic therapy with cephalosporins. But nothing seems to work. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's take a closer look at your skin. We will need to conduct a histopathological examination of a facial skin sample to better understand the underlying cause. [After examination] Doctor: The examination showed chronic and granulomatous findings. There was dermal edema, vascular ectasia, and lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrates around your sebaceous follicles, which form small granulomas surrounded by occasional neutrophils.  Patient: Oh, wow. What does that mean? Doctor: It means that your skin is showing signs of inflammation, which is causing the eruptions. The previous topical agents you've used may have also caused local irritation, burn, and pinching complaints. We will try a different approach. I'm going to prescribe topical tacrolimus 0.03% as a monotherapy for your condition. Patient: Okay, will that help with the eruptions? Doctor: Yes, it should help improve the erythema and overall appearance of your skin. After one month, we will evaluate your response to the therapy and make any necessary adjustments. [After one month] Patient: Hi, I'm back. My face has improved a lot, but now I have new lesions on my upper trunk and left upper limb. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that your facial skin has improved. However, the appearance of new lesions elsewhere is concerning. In addition to the topical tacrolimus, I'm going to prescribe oral azithromycin at a dose of 320mg/day for five days. Patient: Will that help with the new lesions? Doctor: Yes, this combination should help provide disease remission and address the new lesions. Please update me on your progress after you finish the course of azithromycin. Patient: Alright, I will. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. I hope you continue to see improvements in your skin. [/INST] S: The patient reports having erythematous and desquamative papular eruptions on the face and genital region for about a year, particularly around the mouth and eyes. The patient has tried multiple treatments including corticosteroids, imidazole, immunomodulators, and cephalosporins without success. The eruptions have significantly impacted the patient's social interactions. O: Physical examination revealed chronic and granulomatous skin changes with dermal edema, vascular ectasia, and lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrates around sebaceous follicles. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of small granulomas surrounded by occasional neutrophils. Initial treatment with topical tacrolimus 0.03% showed improvement in facial skin but the patient developed new lesions on the upper trunk and left upper limb. A: The primary diagnosis is a chronic granulomatous dermatitis with complications including spread to new areas despite initial treatment success. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of dermatitis or infectious etiologies that mimic granulomatous inflammation. P: Continue topical tacrolimus 0.03% for ongoing management of facial lesions. Introduce oral azithromycin at a dose of 320mg/day for five days to address new lesions on the upper trunk and left upper limb. Schedule a follow-up after the course of azithromycin to assess response and adjust treatment as necessary. Educate the patient on the importance of adhering to the treatment regimen and encourage reporting of any new symptoms or adverse effects. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello! So, what brings you in today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I'm an 11-year-old girl, and I've been seeing some floaters in my right eye lately. Doctor: I see. Do you have any history of medical or ophthalmological conditions, such as hypertension or thrombocytopenia, which could cause bleeding in the eye? Patient: No, I don't have any medical history like that. Doctor: Have you experienced any trauma or taken any medications recently? Patient: No, I haven't. Doctor: Alright, let's check your vision. Please read the Snellen chart for me. Patient: Okay, I can read up to the 20/20 line with both eyes. Doctor: Great. Now let me check your intraocular pressure. It's 15 mmHg in your right eye and 16 mmHg in your left eye. Let's do a slit lamp examination to check the health of your eyes. Patient: Sure, go ahead. Doctor: The examination revealed no specific findings in the anterior segment of both eyes, and no relative afferent pupillary defect. However, I did find -3.5 diopters of myopia in both eyes. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: I also did a fundus examination and optical coherence tomography, which showed a tilted disc, intrapapillary hemorrhage, peripapillary subretinal hemorrhage, and mild vitreous hemorrhage in your right eye. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: It may look concerning, but don't worry too much just yet. We also did a fluorescein angiography, which showed blocked fluorescence due to peripapillary subretinal hemorrhage at the early phase, but no definite leakage or new vessels were noted at the late phase. Patient: So, what does that mean, Doctor? Doctor: It means that although there is some hemorrhage in your eye, it doesn't appear to be actively leaking or causing new blood vessel growth. I would recommend further evaluations, including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to rule out any other issues. Patient: Hmm, I think I'll just stick to ophthalmological evaluations for now, if that's okay. Doctor: That's fine. We can monitor your condition and see how it progresses. After 4 weeks, the hemorrhage in your right eye had partially resolved without any treatment. Patient: Oh, that's good news! Doctor: Yes, and after 3 months, complete resolution was noted, with a BCVA of 20/20 in your right eye. Patient: Wow, that's great! Thank you, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome! If you notice any changes in your vision or have any concerns, don't hesitate to come back for a follow-up. [/INST] S: An 11-year-old girl presents with complaints of seeing floaters in her right eye. She denies any relevant medical history, trauma, or recent medication use. She reports no symptoms of hypertension or thrombocytopenia. O: Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes. Intraocular pressure measures 15 mmHg in the right eye and 16 mmHg in the left eye. Slit lamp examination shows no abnormalities in the anterior segment and no relative afferent pupillary defect. The patient has -3.5 diopters of myopia in both eyes. Fundus examination and optical coherence tomography reveal a tilted disc, intrapapillary hemorrhage, peripapillary subretinal hemorrhage, and mild vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye. Fluorescein angiography indicates blocked fluorescence due to peripapillary subretinal hemorrhage in the early phase, with no leakage or new vessel formation in the late phase. Follow-up after 4 weeks shows partial resolution of the hemorrhage, and after 3 months, complete resolution with a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/20 in the right eye. A: The primary diagnosis is vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye, likely secondary to peripapillary subretinal hemorrhage. Differential diagnoses initially considered included trauma and hypertension-related complications, which were ruled out based on history and clinical findings. The prognosis is favorable given the spontaneous resolution of the hemorrhage and maintenance of 20/20 vision. P: The management plan includes monitoring the patient's condition with regular ophthalmological evaluations. No immediate treatment is necessary given the spontaneous resolution of the hemorrhage. The patient is advised to return for follow-up or sooner if she notices any changes in her vision or develops new symptoms. Further imaging studies like brain MRI were considered but deferred per patient's preference to focus on ophthalmological assessments. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you were admitted with recurrent episodes of retrosternal chest pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath. You also have an elevated troponin T level. Can you tell me more about these episodes? Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling these pains in my chest and getting tired and short of breath pretty often lately. Doctor: I understand. Were you aware that you had suffered an acute episode of myocarditis four years ago that required hospital admission? Patient: Yes, I remember that. Doctor: Do you have any relevant medical history or family history of cardiac disease? Patient: No, I don't have any other medical issues, and there's no family history of cardiac disease. Doctor: Okay, that's good to know. Also, are you a smoker or do you consume alcohol? Patient: I'm a nonsmoker, and I drink alcohol occasionally. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Your clinical examination didn't show any evidence of heart failure or systemic disease. Your ECG showed normal sinus rhythm without any ischemic changes, and your chest X-ray showed no evidence of infection or heart failure. Patient: That's a relief. Doctor: Your routine blood tests, including antinuclear antibody, creatinine kinase, rheumatoid factor, and C-reactive protein, were all within normal limits. However, your cardiac troponin T was elevated with a peak value of 2700 ng/l, which is significantly higher than the normal level of less than 14 ng/l. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We also did further extensive inflammatory, viral, and autoimmune screening, which was carried out and found to be negative. Your coronary angiogram showed normal coronary arteries, and your transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55% with trace mitral regurgitation. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It means that your heart function is generally normal, but there are signs of inflammation in your heart muscle. The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive subepicardial and midwall late enhancement typical of myocarditis in the anterior, lateral, and inferior walls, along with extensive fibrosis. Patient: So how do we treat it? Doctor: We treated you with a short course of steroids and anti-inflammatory medication as an inpatient, which resulted in the resolution of your myocarditis symptoms. Your troponin T level normalized, and you were discharged with a plan to repeat the cardiac MRI in six months. Patient: That sounds good. Doctor: On follow-up as an outpatient, it was decided to refer you to rheumatology for an opinion regarding ongoing immunomodulatory therapy. At this juncture, you mentioned that you also had symptoms of stiffness and aching in your calf muscles for quite some time but didn't consider it relevant. Patient: Yeah, I didn't think it was related to my heart issues. Doctor: Despite persistently normal skeletal muscle enzyme levels, we performed an MRI of your lower legs, which showed active myositis involving the gastrocnemius muscles bilaterally. As you have ongoing myositis despite minimal symptoms, we'll need to keep monitoring your condition and consider further treatment options. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient reports recurrent episodes of retrosternal chest pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath. He has a history of acute myocarditis four years ago and denies any other medical issues or family history of cardiac disease. He is a nonsmoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. O: Clinical examination showed no signs of heart failure or systemic disease. ECG indicated normal sinus rhythm with no ischemic changes. Chest X-ray was normal. Routine blood tests were within normal limits except for an elevated cardiac troponin T level at 2700 ng/l (normal <14 ng/l). Inflammatory, viral, and autoimmune screenings were negative. Coronary angiogram and transthoracic echocardiography were normal, but cardiac MRI revealed extensive subepicardial and midwall late enhancement and fibrosis, indicative of myocarditis. MRI of the lower legs showed active myositis in the gastrocnemius muscles bilaterally. A: The primary diagnosis is recurrent myocarditis with associated myositis. Differential diagnoses were ruled out through extensive testing. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic with appropriate management, though the recurrence of myocarditis and presence of myositis require careful monitoring. P: The patient was treated with steroids and anti-inflammatory medication, which normalized the troponin T levels and alleviated myocarditis symptoms. He was discharged with a follow-up plan including a repeat cardiac MRI in six months. Referral to rheumatology for evaluation of ongoing immunomodulatory therapy was made. Ongoing monitoring of myositis and consideration of further treatment options are necessary. The patient is advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle, avoid smoking, and moderate alcohol consumption. </s>"

Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: During your physical examination, you were found to be febrile and tachycardic. We also noticed left testicular edema and pain on epididymal palpation. We conducted some laboratory tests and found neutrophilic leukocytosis with 24.2 x103/uL WBC and 87% neutrophils. Your chest X-ray showed thickening of the bronchial walls, but no concomitant parenchymal abnormalities. The urinalysis showed an increase in white blood cells and a few Gram-negative bacteria. Have you been informed about these results? Patient: Yeah, the doctor mentioned something about that. Doctor: We also performed a testicular ultrasound which revealed an abscess in the tail of your left epididymis. Because of this, we started you on oral doxycycline therapy. However, on the fourth day, you developed worsening respiratory symptoms and inadequate metabolic control with HbA1c at 8.7% and central glycemia at 510 mg/dL. This required your transfer to the intermediate-care unit for management of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.  Patient: I remember that, it was a tough time. Doctor: We then conducted a CT of your abdomen and pelvis, which was normal. However, a follow-up chest X-ray showed multiple bilateral nodular lesions and left pleural effusion. Your blood and urine cultures came back positive for K. pneumoniae, which is sensitive to penicillin, quinolone, and carbapenem.  Patient: Oh, I didn't know about that. Doctor: A CT of your chest confirmed the presence of multiple bilateral nodules with halo sign and reversed halo sign. Given the presence of an extrapulmonary infective focus, your respiratory symptoms, the isolation of bacteria in your blood, and the multiple bilateral nodules in the chest CT scan, we considered the diagnosis of SPE secondary to epididymitis. As a result, we decided to suspend the doxycycline and start intravenous ciprofloxacin. Patient: Okay, so what's the plan now? Doctor: Your clinical evolution after a 14-day antibiotic course has been satisfactory. There's been an improvement in your respiratory symptoms and a marked decrease in your testicular pain and edema. Your chest X-ray also showed improvement. We will continue to monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. Patient: That's good to hear. Thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, a male with a history of insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, stage 3 chronic renal disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, reports experiencing left-sided testicular pain for about a month, accompanied by a dry cough. Over the past four days, he has developed a fever, general weakness, fatigue, and decreased appetite. O: Physical examination revealed fever, tachycardia, left testicular edema, and pain on epididymal palpation. Laboratory tests showed neutrophilic leukocytosis (WBC 24.2 x103/uL with 87% neutrophils), urinalysis indicated increased white blood cells and presence of Gram-negative bacteria. Chest X-ray demonstrated bronchial wall thickening without parenchymal abnormalities. Testicular ultrasound revealed an abscess in the tail of the left epididymis. Follow-up imaging included a CT of the abdomen and pelvis (normal), and chest X-ray and CT showing multiple bilateral nodular lesions, left pleural effusion, and halo signs. Blood and urine cultures were positive for K. pneumoniae, sensitive to penicillin, quinolone, and carbapenem. The patient's HbA1c was 8.7% and central glycemia was 510 mg/dL. A: The primary diagnosis is septic pulmonary embolism (SPE) secondary to epididymitis, complicated by hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Differential diagnoses included other sources of infection due to immunocompromised state from chronic conditions. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the current improvement with treatment. P: The management plan includes continuation of intravenous ciprofloxacin with close monitoring of antibiotic efficacy and potential side effects. The patient's diabetes and other chronic conditions will be managed aggressively to prevent further complications. Regular follow-up imaging and labs will be conducted to monitor the resolution of pulmonary and testicular findings. Education on infection signs, glucose control, and compliance with the treatment regimen will be reinforced. Referrals to endocrinology for diabetes management and urology for ongoing testicular issues are planned. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been having a severe generalized headache and some loss of vision on my right side. Doctor: I see. Let's start by getting a Head CT to check for any abnormalities.  (After receiving the results) Doctor: Your Head CT shows that you have an acute left parieto-occipital intracerebral hemorrhage.  Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We will need to monitor your condition closely. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently? Patient: Well, about two months ago, I developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Doctor: Were you treated for those seizures? Patient: Yes, I was treated with levetiracetam. Doctor: Okay, good. Upon examination, it seems you also have mild ideomotor apraxia. Have you had any head injuries in the past? Patient: Yes, when I was just 4 weeks old, I had a significant head injury that caused a left parietal skull fracture. I was later diagnosed with post-traumatic focal epilepsy and treated with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine. Doctor: I see. And have you had any surgeries related to that injury? Patient: Yes, at 3 months old, I underwent a left parietal craniectomy and cadaveric dural repair. Doctor: Thank you for that information. We performed a Brain MRI after your intracerebral hemorrhage, and it showed several left temporal lobar microbleeds. We also conducted digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which revealed subtle nonspecific vascular abnormalities around the craniectomy.  Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It's not entirely clear yet, but we'll continue to monitor your condition. Imaging done 3 months later showed an acute left superior parietal hemorrhage, but there were no new vascular abnormalities on the repeat DSA. Patient: And what about my most recent MRI? Doctor: The MRI performed 15 months later showed regression of the left temporal hematoma, and mild gyral swelling in the temporal and parietal parenchyma with abnormal sulcal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal, local leptomeningeal enhancement, and additional microbleeds. Patient: I see. What else did you find? Doctor: We also performed an 18F-Florbetapir amyloid PET, which demonstrated widespread cortical amyloid deposition. Furthermore, your CSF analyses showed low levels of Aβ1-42, total tau, and phospho-tau, but normal 14-3-3 and S100β. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: These findings suggest that you may be at risk for dementia. We performed next-generation sequencing for mutations in genes associated with dementia, but the results are not yet available. We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as needed. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient reports severe generalized headache and partial vision loss on the right side. He has a history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures treated with levetiracetam, a significant head injury at 4 weeks old resulting in a left parietal skull fracture, post-traumatic focal epilepsy treated with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine, and a left parietal craniectomy with cadaveric dural repair at 3 months old. O: Head CT revealed an acute left parieto-occipital intracerebral hemorrhage. Brain MRI showed left temporal lobar microbleeds, mild gyral swelling in the temporal and parietal parenchyma, abnormal sulcal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal, local leptomeningeal enhancement, and additional microbleeds.

An 18F-Florbetapir amyloid PET scan demonstrated widespread cortical amyloid deposition. The patient also exhibits mild ideomotor apraxia. A: Primary diagnosis is acute left parieto-occipital intracerebral hemorrhage with complications including potential early signs of dementia, indicated by amyloid deposition and CSF biomarkers. Differential diagnoses include progression of post-traumatic epilepsy and vascular abnormalities secondary to previous surgeries and injuries. P: Continue monitoring neurological status and repeat imaging studies as needed to assess progression or resolution of hemorrhage and microbleeds. Maintain antiepileptic therapy with levetiracetam and consider adjustments based on seizure control and side effects. Initiate consultations with neurosurgery and neurology for management of intracerebral hemorrhage and potential surgical interventions. Educate the patient on signs of dementia progression and ensure regular follow-up for cognitive assessment. Await genetic testing results to further guide management and counseling regarding dementia risk. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I understand you've been referred for an evaluation of a mass on your left wrist. Can you tell me more about it? Patient: Yeah, my parents noticed a soft tissue mass about 4-5 mm in diameter four months ago, and it's been progressively enlarging. Doctor: I see. Do you have any history of trauma, vascular access, or inherited vascular, collagen, or rheumatologic disorders? Patient: No, I had a benign birth history and no history of any of those disorders. Doctor: Alright. Upon examination, I can see a 1 cm bluish, non-tender, pulsatile mass over your left radial artery. We performed a Doppler-assisted Allen test which raised concerns regarding the patency of the involved artery. We then conducted an arterial duplex which revealed a 9 x 9 mm suspected true aneurysm with normal flow distally.  Patient: Oh, okay. Doctor: To further examine the issue, we did a Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) which demonstrated a 1.1 x 0.8 x 1.0 cm mass arising off the radial artery with retrograde filling from the superficial palmar arch and thrombosis proximal to the lesion. Patient: Hmm, what does that mean? Doctor: It means that there's a mass connected to your radial artery, which is filled with blood from the palmar arch, and there's a blood clot near the lesion. Due to these findings, we recommended surgical excision with possible reconstruction. Patient: I see. How did the surgery go? Doctor: Intraoperatively, we found that the arterial lesion was multi-lobular, focally bluish, and adhered to the flexor carpi radialis sheath. Trial clamping of the radial artery proximally and distally demonstrated maintenance of brisk distal capillary refill throughout, confirming a complete, patent arch. Patient: So, what did you do next? Doctor: We excised the abnormal segment, and robust arterial backflow was noted from the distal stump of the radial artery following transection. We decided that reconstruction with a vein graft was not necessary, as it would result in significantly prolonged anaesthesia time for a young patient like you. So, we simply ligated the radial artery. Patient: Alright, and what did the histopathology show? Doctor: The histopathology of the specimen exhibited medial attenuation with large areas of complete media loss, consistent with a pseudoaneurysm. We also noted intimal fibroplasia with incorporating mural thrombus. These changes were most consistent with fibromuscular dysplasia. Patient: So, what does that mean for me now? Doctor: It means that we've removed the mass and addressed the issue. We'll continue to monitor your recovery and provide any necessary follow-up care. If you have any concerns or notice any changes, please don't hesitate to contact us. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, referred for evaluation of a progressively enlarging mass on the left wrist, reported noticing the mass four months ago, initially about 4-5 mm in diameter. The patient denies any history of trauma, vascular access, or inherited vascular, collagen, or rheumatologic disorders. O: Physical examination revealed a 1 cm bluish, non-tender, pulsatile mass over the left radial artery. Doppler-assisted Allen test indicated concerns about arterial patency. Arterial duplex showed a 9 x 9 mm suspected true aneurysm with normal flow distally. Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) demonstrated a 1.1 x 0.8 x 1.0 cm mass arising off the radial artery with retrograde filling and proximal thrombosis. Intraoperative findings confirmed a multi-lobular, focally bluish mass adhered to the flexor carpi radialis sheath. Histopathology indicated medial attenuation, areas of complete media loss, intimal fibroplasia, and mural thrombus, consistent with a pseudoaneurysm and fibromuscular dysplasia. A: The primary diagnosis is a pseudoaneurysm of the left radial artery secondary to fibromuscular dysplasia. Differential diagnosis initially included a true aneurysm. P: Surgical excision of the mass was performed without the need for arterial reconstruction. The radial artery was ligated after confirming the maintenance of distal capillary refill. The patient is advised to monitor the surgical site and general wrist function, and report any abnormalities. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to ensure proper recovery and to monitor for potential complications. Further education on the signs of compromised blood flow to the hand and when to seek immediate care will be provided. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello there, sweetie. Your parents have told me that you've been experiencing some developmental delay, and you're having a hard time at school. Can you tell me about your school performance and if you've had any problems walking? Patient: Yeah, I don't do well in school, and I used to have trouble walking, but it's better now. Doctor: I see. We've conducted an MRI to look into these issues, and it showed a hyperintense signal, particularly in the right semi-oval center. This has been consistent in all the successive MRI studies we've done. Although your gait impairment has improved, there is still a certain degree of motor clumsiness. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: As for your learning problems, they seem to have worsened, and now you need a curricular adaptation. The school reports suggest that you may have borderline intelligence or mild mental retardation. Patient: Oh, that's not good. Doctor: We've also found some abnormalities in the transcription of your EN2 gene, which implies the deletion of 182 bases, specifically between 1944 and 2125 of the complementary sequence, marked as C5. This may be related to your developmental issues. Patient: So, what does that mean? Doctor: It means that there is a genetic factor contributing to your developmental delay and learning difficulties. However, we didn't find any alterations in genes LIS1, PTAFR, PAFAH1B2, PAFAH1B3, FGF8, and PAX2, which is a positive sign. Patient: What can we do about it? Doctor: We will continue to monitor your progress and work closely with your school to provide you with the necessary support and adaptations to your curriculum. This will help you improve your learning experience and overall development. Patient: Okay, thank you. Doctor: You're welcome. Stay strong and keep working hard. We'll be here to support you every step of the way. If you or your parents have any concerns, don't hesitate to contact us. Patient: Thanks, doctor. We will. [/INST] S: The patient, a child, reports poor academic performance and a history of walking difficulties, which have recently improved. The patient acknowledges ongoing motor clumsiness and worsening learning problems, necessitating curricular adaptations. O: MRI findings indicate a hyperintense signal in the right semi-oval center, consistent across successive studies. Genetic testing reveals a deletion of 182 bases in the EN2 gene (positions 1944 to 2125 of the complementary sequence, marked as C5). No alterations were found in genes LIS1, PTAFR, PAFAH1B2, PAFAH1B3, FGF8, and PAX2. A: The primary diagnosis is developmental delay with motor clumsiness and learning difficulties, likely influenced by the identified genetic abnormality in the EN2 gene. Differential diagnosis could include other genetic or neurological conditions, but these are less likely given the specific findings and absence of alterations in other tested genes. P: The management plan includes ongoing monitoring of the patient's development and academic progress. Collaboration with educational institutions to adapt the curriculum and provide necessary support for learning difficulties. Genetic counseling for the family to understand the implications of the EN2 gene deletion and discuss potential genetic contributions to the patient's condition. Regular follow-up appointments to assess progress and adjust the management plan as needed. Encouragement of patient and family to contact healthcare providers with any concerns or questions regarding the condition or treatment plan. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that you had an operation for TOF by Professor Shigeru Sakakibara in Tokyo when you were 10 years old. How have you been since then? Patient: Hi, after the operation I didn't have any difficulty performing daily activities, so I stopped visiting the hospital a few years later. I got married when I was 25 and even had two children at 29 without needing any special gynecological care. Doctor: It's great to hear that you've been able to lead a normal life. Have you experienced any symptoms related to your heart since then? Patient: Not really, I was able to work and raise my children without any issues. But when I was 70, a health examination showed I had low oxygen saturation. I didn't seek any hospital care though. Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any changes in your health recently? Patient: Yes, when I turned 72, I developed dyspnea and leg edema. A local clinic diagnosed me with heart failure and started me on diuretics. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Since you've been referred to our hospital for further evaluation, let me go over your current symptoms and test results. Your symptoms of heart failure are comparable with NYHA functional class III. Your oxygen saturation is 88% on room air at rest. During the heart examination, we noticed a continuous murmur (Levine III/VI) and a systolic ejection murmur (IV/VI) in the second right sternal border. Patient: Hmm, okay. What about the other test results? Doctor: Your laboratory data shows the following values: hemoglobin level of 15.7 g/dl, hematocrit of 44.5%, platelet count of 19.7 × 104/μl, prothrombin time of 11.4 seconds or 98.5%, D-dimer level of 1.2 μg/dl, creatinine level of 1.35 mg/dl, and serum brain-type natriuretic peptide level of 210 pg/ml. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We also performed a chest radiograph which revealed a cardiothoracic ratio of 66%, right-sided aortic arch, and prominently dilated PA without pulmonary congestion. Lastly, the electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a prolonged PR interval and ST-T. Patient: So, what does all this mean, doctor? Doctor: These results indicate that you are experiencing heart failure, which is consistent with your symptoms of dyspnea and leg edema. It is important that we continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as needed to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Patient: Alright. What should I do next? Doctor: We will schedule regular follow-up appointments to keep an eye on your condition and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. It's important for you to stay in touch with us and let us know if you notice any changes in your symptoms or overall health. Patient: Okay, I understand. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll work together to help you manage your heart failure and maintain the best possible quality of life. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. [/INST] S: The 72-year-old patient reports a history of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) corrected at age 10. She experienced normal health post-surgery, leading an active life without hospital visits until age 70, when low oxygen saturation was noted during a routine health examination. At 72, she developed symptoms of dyspnea and leg edema, and was diagnosed with heart failure at a local clinic, where she was started on diuretics. O: Current examination reveals NYHA functional class III heart failure symptoms. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air at rest. Heart auscultation shows a continuous murmur (Levine III/VI) and a systolic ejection murmur (IV/VI) at the second right sternal border. Laboratory results include hemoglobin 15.7 g/dl, hematocrit 44.5%, platelet count 197,000/μl, prothrombin time 11.4 seconds (98.5%), D-dimer 1.2 μg/dl, creatinine 1.35 mg/dl, and serum brain-type natriuretic peptide 210 pg/ml. Chest radiograph shows a cardiothoracic ratio of 66%, right-sided aortic arch, and dilated pulmonary artery without pulmonary congestion. ECG indicates sinus rhythm with prolonged PR interval and ST-T changes. A: The patient is diagnosed with heart failure, likely secondary to long-term sequelae of corrected TOF. The presence of a continuous murmur and systolic ejection murmur, along with imaging and lab findings, supports this diagnosis. Differential diagnoses could include pulmonary hypertension or recurrent cardiac issues related to her original TOF. P: The management plan includes regular follow-up appointments to monitor heart function and adjust treatment as necessary. The patient will continue on diuretics and may require additional heart failure medications based on ongoing evaluations.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. How can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I'm having pain and swelling on the medial aspect of my right ankle, and it's difficult for me to walk. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me how this injury happened? Patient: I'm a karate coach, and I got injured while umpiring a competition. I stepped on the floor with my ankle dorsiflexed and my knee flexed to avoid a player, and I immediately felt pain and heard a snapping sound in my ankle. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any past medical history I should know about? Patient: No, I don't have any other medical history. Doctor: Do you smoke or drink alcohol? Patient: I don't smoke, but I do drink alcohol moderately. Doctor: Alright. We have conducted a physical examination and observed that your right ankle is swollen, and there is marked tenderness at the posterior of the medial malleolus (Fig.). We also performed varus stress, valgus stress, and anterior drawer tests, and there was no ankle instability confirmed. Patient: Oh, okay. Doctor: We manually reduced the dislocated tibialis posterior tendon using local anesthesia (1% xylocaine) around the medial malleolus (Fig.). There was no neurological deficit observed. Patient: That's good to hear. Doctor: We also took standard radiographs of your ankle, and the appearance was normal (Fig.). However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an anterior subluxated tibialis posterior tendon that laid on the medial malleolus. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It means that the tendon has shifted forward from its normal position. Additionally, signal changes shown in the transverse plane of T2-weighted MRI scans revealed suspected fluid or bleeding at the retromalleolar groove (Fig.). Patient: So, what's the diagnosis, Doctor? Doctor: Based on the examination and imaging, we have diagnosed a dislocation of the tibialis posterior tendon. Patient: What's the next step? Doctor: We performed surgical treatment 4 days after your injury. Intraoperatively, the flexor retinaculum was detached from the medial malleolus, and a tendon sheath tear was noted. The tibialis posterior tendon was dislocated anteriorly from the medial malleolus groove. The tendon was torn longitudinally and sutured using 4-0 nylon. Patient: I see. Thank you, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. Make sure to follow up with us for any further care or concerns. [/INST] S: The patient, a karate coach, reports pain and swelling on the medial aspect of the right ankle, with difficulty walking. The injury occurred during a karate competition when the patient stepped awkwardly, causing immediate pain and a snapping sound.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 38-year-old nulliparous woman who presented to our emergency unit with right lower abdominal pain. Can you tell me more about your pain? Patient: Yeah, it's been really bothering me. It's in my lower right side and it's been quite painful. Doctor: I understand. We've checked your biochemistry and there were no significant changes. Your negative pregnancy test, normal C-reactive protein, and lack of other infection signs are helpful in ruling out some possible causes. We also performed an abdominal ultrasound, which showed a non-echogenic cyst in your right flank. To get more information, we did a computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous and oral contrast, which confirmed the presence of a right lower abdominal cystic formation. It has a diameter of approximately 38 by 33 millimeters and a density of 24 Hounsfield units. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: The imaging also revealed a narrow approximation of the cyst with the colon ascendens and the psoas muscle, as well as a very discrete infiltration of the perilesional fat tissue. Based on these findings, we considered a few possible diagnoses, such as enteric duplication cyst, mesenterial cyst, peritoneal inclusion cyst, and appendiceal mucocele. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: We also conducted a gynecological examination that showed a normal cervix in speculo. A bimanual vaginal examination reported a mobile uterus with normal adnexa. Additionally, a vaginal ultrasound showed an intrauterine device in your uterine cavity, a normal left ovary, but the right adnex could not be visualized. Patient: Oh, that's interesting. Doctor: To further investigate the origin of your abdominal pain, we hospitalized you and planned an explorative laparoscopy a few days after the first symptoms appeared. During the laparoscopy, we found that your appendix was normal, without mucocele. The cecum was located deep in the right fossa. Patient: What about my internal genitals? Doctor: Exploration of your internal genitals showed a unicornuate uterus and a normal left fallopian tube and ovary. The right fallopian tube and ovary could not be visualized in the right pelvis but were found to be infrahepatically. Both the ovary and fallopian tube were positioned upon the psoas muscle, which was also crossed over by the right ureter. Patient: Oh, wow. Doctor: We also observed a firm spherical formation over the course of the left round ligament, which is most likely a rudimentary part of your unicornuate uterus. Patient: So, what does this all mean? Doctor: In summary, we believe that the cyst and the abnormal position of your right adnexa may be contributing to your abdominal pain. We'll discuss with you the next steps and possible treatment options to address these issues. [/INST] S: The patient is a 38-year-old nulliparous woman presenting with right lower abdominal pain. She describes the pain as quite painful and localized to the lower right side. O: The patient's biochemistry showed no significant changes. A negative pregnancy test, normal C-reactive protein levels, and absence of infection signs were noted. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a non-echogenic cyst in the right flank. CT scan confirmed a right lower abdominal cystic formation measuring 38x33 mm with a density of 24 Hounsfield units, closely approximated to the colon ascendens and the psoas muscle, with slight infiltration of the perilesional fat tissue. Gynecological examination showed a normal cervix and mobile uterus with normal adnexa; however, the right adnex could not be visualized. Vaginal ultrasound confirmed the presence of an intrauterine device and a normal left ovary. Explorative laparoscopy showed a normal appendix and cecum, a unicornuate uterus, a normal left fallopian tube and ovary, and infrahepatically positioned right fallopian tube and ovary over the psoas muscle. A: The primary diagnosis is abdominal pain likely due to a right lower abdominal cyst and abnormal positioning of the right adnexa. Differential diagnoses considered include enteric duplication cyst, mesenterial cyst, peritoneal inclusion cyst, and appendiceal mucocele. The unicornuate uterus and infrahepatic position of the right adnexa are additional anatomical findings contributing to the symptomatology. P: The management plan includes discussing treatment options for the cyst and the abnormal positioning of the right adnexa. Further consultations with a gynecologist and a general surgeon are planned to evaluate surgical options and manage the patient's anatomical abnormalities. Patient education regarding the findings and potential treatment implications will be provided to ensure understanding and compliance.

Mother: The doctor reassured me and suggested changing her milk formula, which seemed to help for a week. Doctor: But then she started having recurrent vomiting and irritability, right? Mother: Yes, that's when we took her for a computed tomography (CT) scan, and they found a large posterior fossa tumor with obstructive hydrocephalus. Doctor: I see. So, she was admitted to King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah at 20 days old. She was presenting with frequent vomiting, poor feeding, and an increasing head circumference. Is that correct? Mother: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: During the physical exam, your baby appeared irritable and emaciated, falling in the second percentile of weight for her age. Her head circumference had increased to 45 cm, with visibly dilated scalp veins and a bulging anterior fontanel. The neurological exam showed a conscious baby with spontaneous movement of her upper and lower extremities, but with mild spasticity. Did the doctors mention anything about her cranial nerves? Mother: They said there was something called Parinaud's syndrome, but I don't really understand what that means. Doctor: Parinaud's syndrome is a condition that affects the eye movement. The pupillary reflex was sluggish to light, but her vision was normal, and no papilledema was detected. The routine laboratory screening tests were within normal limits. An MRI scan revealed a 60x55x45 mm midline tumor filling most of the posterior fossa, causing an anterior displacement of the brain. Mother: Oh, that sounds serious. What can be done for my baby? Doctor: The next step is to discuss the treatment options with a specialist. They will be able to guide you through the process and determine the best course of action for your baby's condition. We will make sure your baby receives the best possible care. [/INST] S: The patient, a newborn female born on January 1st, 1999, presented with symptoms of recurrent vomiting, poor feeding, irritability, and an increasing head circumference. The mother reported a history of mild ventriculomegaly noted during a 34-week prenatal ultrasound. The baby was born via cesarean section at full term, with Apgar scores of 8 and 10, and a birth weight of 3150 g. The mother also noted the baby had a squint in her eyes. O: At 20 days old, the baby was admitted to King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah. Physical examination revealed an irritable and emaciated baby with a head circumference of 45 cm, dilated scalp veins, and a bulging anterior fontanel. Neurological examination showed mild spasticity and spontaneous movement in all extremities. Parinaud's syndrome was noted, affecting eye movement, with a sluggish pupillary reflex to light but no papilledema. Routine laboratory screening tests were within normal limits. An MRI scan showed a 60x55x45 mm midline tumor in the posterior fossa, causing anterior displacement of the brain and obstructive hydrocephalus. A: The primary diagnosis is a large posterior fossa tumor with obstructive hydrocephalus. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of increased intracranial pressure in neonates. The presence of Parinaud's syndrome and the findings from the MRI are consistent with a significant mass effect from the tumor. P: The management plan includes referral to a pediatric neurosurgeon for evaluation and discussion of surgical options to address the tumor and hydrocephalus. The baby will require close monitoring of neurological status and head circumference, along with supportive care for symptoms such as vomiting and poor feeding. Nutritional support may be necessary given the baby's emaciated state. Further consultations with a pediatric ophthalmologist are recommended due to the noted squint and to assess any potential impact on vision. Family education regarding the baby's condition, prognosis, and care requirements will be essential for ongoing management and support. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you're an asthmatic patient and you've come here today with severe groin pain and limitation of movement. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, doctor. The pain in my groin has been getting worse and it's really affecting my ability to move around. Doctor: I see. I noticed in your records that you had a cementless THR on the right side 7 years ago for corticosteroid-induced AVN. How has that been since then? Patient: Well, about 5 years after the surgery, I started experiencing progressive hip pain and a decrease in my walking ability. Doctor: I understand. We performed some tests, including an AP X-ray of the pelvis, which showed loose cup with migration, medial to Kohler's line, and proximal migration of the stem. A CT scan confirmed the intrapelvic protrusion and showed an extensive osteolytic defect with suspicion of pelvic discontinuity. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We also performed a CT angiography, which showed mild displacement of the external iliac vessels but excluded any aneurysms, so that's a positive sign. We checked for infection as well with a preoperative work-up including CBC, ESR, and CRP, and those results were normal. Patient: That's a relief. Doctor: After reviewing your case, we've decided to go through a single-stage procedure, which involves a pararectus approach for cup extraction and pelvis discontinuity fixation, followed by a direct lateral approach for components' revision. Patient: How will that work, doctor? Doctor: We'll have the assistance of a general surgeon for this procedure. You'll be placed in a supine position and a skin incision will be made, followed by incisions through the subcutaneous fat and deep layer of the fascia of the anterior abdominal wall. We'll then enter the extraperitoneal space by incising the fascia transversalis and retract the peritoneum craniomedially. Patient: What happens next? Doctor: We'll then isolate and retract the external iliac artery and vein, iliacus and psoas muscles with the femoral nerve, and the vas deferens using rubber catheters. After the isolation, we'll work on removing the thick fibrous membrane surrounding the cup and proceed with the necessary steps to fix the issue. Patient: I see, doctor. Thank you for explaining the procedure to me. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll schedule the surgery and discuss any further details with you beforehand. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. [/INST] S: Patient reports severe groin pain and decreased mobility. History of cementless total hip replacement (THR) on the right side 7 years ago due to corticosteroid-induced avascular necrosis (AVN). Symptoms of progressive hip pain and reduced walking ability began approximately 2 years post-operation. O: AP X-ray of the pelvis shows loose cup with migration medial to Kohler's line and proximal migration of the stem. CT scan confirms intrapelvic protrusion and extensive osteolytic defect with suspicion of pelvic discontinuity. CT angiography reveals mild displacement of external iliac vessels but no aneurysms. Preoperative work-up including CBC, ESR, and CRP are within normal limits. A: Diagnosis of failed right THR with pelvic discontinuity and osteolysis. Differential diagnosis includes infection, which has been ruled out by normal inflammatory markers and absence of aneurysm by CT angiography. P: Plan for single-stage surgical revision of right THR using a pararectus approach for cup extraction and pelvic discontinuity fixation, followed by a direct lateral approach for components' revision. General surgery assistance will be utilized. Preoperative and postoperative care will include monitoring of vital signs, pain management, and physical therapy. Patient education on the procedure has been provided and further questions are encouraged to ensure understanding and compliance. Surgery scheduling will be coordinated and discussed with the patient. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello there, I see that you've presented to our pediatric hospital today. Can you tell me what's been going on? Patient: Yeah, I've had this torticollis for like 3 weeks now. It all started after I had symptoms of a respiratory tract infection about 4 weeks ago. Doctor: I see. Did you have a fever during that time? Patient: Yes, I had a documented fever at home for 2 days. Doctor: And how were you treated for your respiratory tract infection? Patient: My primary care doctor thought it was streptococcal pharyngitis, so I took a 7-day course of amoxicillin. Doctor: Hmm, and when did you notice the pain in your neck? Patient: Four days into the antibiotics, I woke up from sleep with pain on the left side of my neck. Doctor: Have you been taking any medications for the pain? Patient: Yeah, I've been taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but it hasn't really helped much. Doctor: Is the pain worse with movement? Patient: Yes, it definitely gets worse when I move my neck. Doctor: Was there any head or neck trauma before this started? Patient: No, there was no trauma at all. Doctor: Alright. And at the time of presentation today, have your infectious symptoms resolved? Patient: Yes, those symptoms are gone now. I've just been feeling a bit fatigued but still active enough to play hockey. Doctor: Good to hear. Have you had any rash, joint pain, or weight loss recently? Patient: No, none of those. Doctor: Upon examination, your temperature is normal, and your blood pressure and maximum heart rate of 110 beats per minute are within normal range for your age. I see that your head is tilted to the right with chin rotation to the left. I don't feel any lymphadenopathy or masses on palpation of your neck, and there is no tenderness to palpation of your bilateral sternocleidomastoid muscles. However, your neck has a limited range of motion in all planes due to pain, particularly in lateral flexion. You also have bilateral injected conjunctivas present, but your oropharynx appears normal with no erythema or mucus membrane changes. Your cardiovascular exam shows normal heart sounds and no murmur. Your respiratory and abdominal exams are normal as well, with no distension, tenderness, or hepatosplenomegaly. I didn't hear any bruits on auscultation of major vessel regions, and there are no rashes or desquamation on your skin. Your neurological exam is also normal. Patient: So, what's causing the torticollis then? Doctor: We'll need to conduct further investigations to determine the exact cause. In the meantime, please continue taking your pain medications and let us know if your symptoms worsen. We'll be in touch with you once we have more information and a plan for your treatment. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, a pediatric individual, reports having torticollis for approximately 3 weeks, which began after experiencing symptoms of a respiratory tract infection, presumed to be streptococcal pharyngitis, treated with a 7-day course of amoxicillin. The patient had a fever for two days during the infection. The neck pain started four days into the antibiotic treatment, specifically on the left side, and has not responded well to ibuprofen and acetaminophen. The pain worsens with movement, and there was no preceding trauma. The patient's respiratory symptoms have resolved, but they report feeling fatigued. O: On examination, the patient's temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate are within normal limits. The patient presents with head tilt to the right and chin rotation to the left, limited neck motion in all planes, especially in lateral flexion, and bilateral injected conjunctivas. There is no lymphadenopathy, neck masses, or tenderness of the sternocleidomastoid muscles. The oropharynx is normal without erythema, and cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological exams are unremarkable. A: The primary assessment is persistent torticollis post-respiratory infection, with differential diagnoses including post-infectious muscle spasm or secondary effects from the infection or medication. The absence of trauma and systemic symptoms like rash or joint pain narrows down the causes. Further investigations are needed to rule out other underlying conditions. P: The management plan includes continuing pain management with ibuprofen and acetaminophen. The patient is advised to monitor symptoms and report any worsening. Further diagnostic tests will be scheduled to explore the underlying cause of the torticollis, and follow-up will be arranged to review these results and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello! How can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I was recently diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ and I'm here to discuss my imaging results. Doctor: I understand. Let me take a look at your imaging report. It seems that the parameters used for your imaging were: voltage at 30 kV, tube current at 61, and thickness at 46 mm. There were 15 projections, and the AGD was 1.75. Can you tell me if you've experienced any symptoms related to this condition? Patient: I've noticed a lump in my breast and some discomfort. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Ductal carcinoma in situ is a non-invasive breast cancer, which means it hasn't spread beyond the milk ducts. The imaging parameters used in your case will help us to further evaluate the extent of the carcinoma and plan your treatment accordingly. Patient: Hmm, okay. So what do these numbers mean? Like the voltage and tube current? Doctor: Good question. The voltage, 30 kV, and tube current, 61, are settings used during your mammogram to produce a clear image of your breast tissue. These values help to ensure that we get an accurate picture of the carcinoma for proper diagnosis and treatment planning. Patient: I see. And what about the thickness and AGD? Doctor: The thickness of 46 mm represents the size of your breast during the imaging process. The AGD, or average glandular dose, which was 1.75 in your case, refers to the amount of radiation your breast tissue received during the mammogram. This value is kept as low as possible while still providing clear images for diagnosis. Patient: Oh, I understand now. So, what are the next steps for me? Doctor: Based on your imaging results and symptoms, we'll need to discuss your treatment options, which may include surgery, radiation therapy, or hormone therapy. We'll consider factors like your overall health, preferences, and the specific characteristics of your carcinoma to determine the best course of action for you. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining all of this to me, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We're here to support you through this process. Patient: Thank you, I appreciate that. [/INST] S: The patient, recently diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, reports noticing a lump in her breast and experiencing some discomfort. O: Imaging parameters included a voltage of 30 kV, tube current of 61, and thickness of 46 mm with 15 projections. The average glandular dose (AGD) was 1.75. The patient's symptoms and imaging results are consistent with the diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ, a non-invasive breast cancer. A: The primary diagnosis is ductal carcinoma in situ. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings support this diagnosis. The condition is localized within the milk ducts and has not spread, which is typical for this stage of breast cancer. P: The management plan will involve discussing various treatment options with the patient, including surgery, radiation therapy, or hormone therapy, based on her overall health, preferences, and specific characteristics of the carcinoma. Further consultations with an oncologist and possibly a surgeon will be arranged to finalize the treatment plan. Patient education regarding the nature of the disease, treatment options, and potential outcomes will be provided to ensure informed decision-making. Regular follow-ups will be scheduled to monitor the patient's response to treatment and adjust the plan as necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 22-year-old man who's been experiencing some symptoms lately. Can you please tell me more about what you've been going through? Patient: Yeah, I've been having this chronic upper gastrointestinal bleeding for a while now. It's been really bothering me. Doctor: I see. That sounds quite concerning. We need to perform some tests to figure out what might be causing this bleeding. We'll start with an endoscopy to get a better look at your stomach. Patient: Okay, sounds good. (After the endoscopy) Doctor: Your endoscopy results showed that you have massive gastric polyposis, which could be the cause of your bleeding. We also performed a colonoscopy, which showed a few polyps. We initially tried endoscopic polypectomy to remove the polyps. Patient: Yeah, I remember that. Doctor: Unfortunately, your symptoms progressed, and we had to take further action. We decided to perform a total gastrectomy to remove your entire stomach. Patient: Oh wow, that's a major surgery. I hope it helps with my bleeding issue. Doctor: Yes, it is a significant procedure, but it was necessary due to the severity of your condition. We sent the tissue samples for histology to confirm the diagnosis. Patient: And what did the histology results say? Doctor: The histology results confirmed that you have massive gastric juvenile polyposis. This is the cause of your bleeding, and the total gastrectomy should help manage the symptoms. Patient: I see. So, what do I need to do now for follow-up care? Doctor: We'll closely monitor your recovery and schedule regular check-ups to ensure that the issue has been resolved. It's essential to maintain a healthy diet and follow any specific instructions given by your healthcare team. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance during this challenging time. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to support you throughout your recovery. [/INST] S: The patient is a 22-year-old male who reports chronic upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He describes the bleeding as a persistent issue that has been significantly bothersome. O: The patient underwent an endoscopy which revealed massive gastric polyposis, and a colonoscopy showed additional polyps. Initial treatment involved endoscopic polypectomy, but due to symptom progression, a total gastrectomy was performed. Histology of the removed tissue confirmed massive gastric juvenile polyposis. A: The primary diagnosis is massive gastric juvenile polyposis, which has been causing chronic upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The total gastrectomy was necessary due to the severity and progression of symptoms. P: The patient's post-operative care includes close monitoring and regular check-ups to ensure resolution of the bleeding and successful recovery.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see you've presented to our department suffering from headaches and nausea over the past months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, the headaches have been really bad and the nausea has been making it difficult to go about my daily activities. Doctor: I understand. We've conducted a CT and MRI scan on you, and it revealed an ill-defined tumor measuring 39 × 37 × 29 mm in the anterior-posterior, transverse, and cranial-caudal dimensions. The lesion was slightly hypointense on CT with poor contrast enhancement. On MRI, a hyperintensity was detected on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and on T2-weighted imaging, while a hypointensity was seen on T1-weighted imaging. There was no obstructive hydrocephalus in the right cerebellar hemisphere on T1-weighted images with contrast enhancement. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Yes, it's concerning, but we will do our best to address the issue. I also want to ask about your medical history. Have you had any comorbidities, surgeries, or used any medication? Patient: No, I haven't had any other health issues, surgeries, or used any medications. Doctor: Do you have any history of alcohol, tobacco, or drug use? Patient: No, I've never consumed alcohol, smoked tobacco, or used other drugs. Doctor: Thank you for the information. It's also important to know if there have been any similar cases reported in your family. Patient: No, no relatives of mine have suffered from a tumor in the past. Doctor: Alright. During the neurological examinations at admission, we found no sensorimotor deficits, cranial nerve deficits, or abnormal reflex responses. Your standing and walking abilities were also normal without any unstableness. Your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and laboratory findings, including complete blood count, liver function, renal function, and C-reactive protein, were all within the normal range. Patient: That's good to know, at least. Doctor: Yes, it is. Now, given the findings, surgery is indicated to remove the tumor. We'll need your written consent to proceed. Patient: Okay, I understand. I'll give my consent. Doctor: Great. The surgery will be performed under general anesthesia with you in a semi-sitting position. Monitoring will be done with somatosensory and muscle-evoked potentials. A right-sided suboccipital craniotomy will be performed. Patient: And what will happen during the surgery? Doctor: During the intraoperative examination, we will observe the tumor and remove it using a microsurgical technique called the Sonoca 300. The tumor appears to be glassy gray-black and not well demarcated from the surrounding tissue, so piecemeal tumor removal will be performed. Patient: I see. What can I expect after the surgery? Doctor: Postoperative care will involve monitoring your recovery and ensuring that all surgical outcomes are positive. We will keep you informed and provide guidance on any follow-up requirements. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. That helps put my mind at ease. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to ensure a successful surgery and recovery. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing severe headaches and nausea, which have significantly impacted daily activities over the past few months. The patient denies any past medical history, surgeries, medication use, and any family history of similar conditions. There is also no history of alcohol, tobacco, or drug use. O: Neurological examinations showed no sensorimotor or cranial nerve deficits, and reflex responses were normal. The patient's ability to stand and walk was unaffected. Vital signs and laboratory tests including complete blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests, and C-reactive protein are all within normal limits. Imaging studies revealed a 39 × 37 × 29 mm ill-defined tumor in the right cerebellar hemisphere, slightly hypointense on CT and showing varying intensities on MRI sequences. No obstructive hydrocephalus was noted. A: The primary diagnosis is a brain tumor located in the right cerebellar hemisphere. Differential diagnoses could include benign or malignant neoplasms, but the exact nature will be confirmed post-surgery. The prognosis depends on the histopathological outcome of the surgical specimen. P: The management plan includes surgical removal of the tumor under general anesthesia, using a right-sided suboccipital craniotomy approach. Intraoperative monitoring will include somatosensory and muscle-evoked potentials, and the Sonoca 300 microsurgical technique will be employed for tumor excision. Postoperative care will focus on recovery monitoring and management of any complications. The patient will be informed about the surgery details and postoperative expectations, and written consent for the procedure has been obtained. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess recovery and discuss further treatment or intervention as needed. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: I was diagnosed with type I diabetes when I was 9 years old. My diabetes was poorly controlled during my childhood. Doctor: I see. How has your weight been affected by this? Patient: I gained a lot of weight growing up. At the age of 25, I weighed 105 kg and had a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2. Doctor: It seems that your weight gain might have impacted your renal function. Have you experienced any issues with your kidneys? Patient: Yes, my renal function started to deteriorate, and I needed hemodialysis by the time I was 30. Doctor: I understand. With the development of renal failure, it's not uncommon for secondary hyperparathyroidism to occur. Were you considered for a transplant? Patient: Due to my obesity, I wasn't eligible for a renal transplant or an SPK. Doctor: That must have been difficult for you. So what was the next step for your treatment? Patient: It was decided that I would have bariatric surgery. After a lot of discussion, the best option for me was a RYGBP. Doctor: And when did you undergo this surgery? Patient: I had the surgery when I was 32 years old. They attached my stomach remnant to my abdominal wall for potential future access. Doctor: How has your weight been since the surgery? Patient: Over the next 2 years, I lost 60 kg. Doctor: That's great progress. Were you able to receive a transplant after losing the weight? Patient: Yes, I had an SPK. The donor duodenal segment was diverted to a bowel loop distal to my Roux loop implant site into the common channel. Doctor: And were you given immunosuppressive medications following your transplant? Patient: Yes, I had induction immunosuppression with alemtuzumab, followed by maintenance with tacrolimus, mycophenolate-mofetil, and a steroid taper. Doctor: Were you CMV seronegative before your transplant? Patient: Yes, I was seronegative, and my donor was CMV positive. I received standard prophylaxis with oral ganciclovir for 100 days. Doctor: Have you experienced any complications after your transplant? Patient: I was readmitted to the hospital within 100 days posttransplant with acute CMV disease, but it was successfully treated with intravenous ganciclovir. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. Have you experienced any other issues since your transplant? Patient: I had skin lesions on my right leg which were diagnosed as calciphylaxis. My serum calcium at that time was 14 mg/dl, and I was diagnosed with tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Doctor: How was your tertiary hyperparathyroidism treated? Patient: I had a three-and-a-half-gland resection together with subtotal thymectomy. The left lower parathyroid gland was the only normal appearing, so half of it was preserved, and they made sure the blood supply remained. Doctor: It sounds like you've been through a lot but have received the care you needed. Make sure to continue with your follow-up appointments and reach out if you have any concerns. Take care! [/INST] S: The patient, diagnosed with type I diabetes at age 9, reports a history of poorly controlled diabetes during childhood, significant weight gain leading to a BMI of 40 kg/m2 at age 25, and subsequent development of renal failure requiring hemodialysis by age 30. The patient underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) at age 32, resulting in a weight loss of 60 kg, and later received a simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant. Post-transplant, the patient experienced acute CMV disease and was diagnosed with calciphylaxis and tertiary hyperparathyroidism, for which a three-and-a-half-gland resection and subtotal thymectomy were performed. O: The patient's significant medical interventions include RYGBP with attachment of the stomach remnant to the abdominal wall, SPK transplant with induction immunosuppression using alemtuzumab and maintenance with tacrolimus, mycophenolate-mofetil, and a steroid taper. Post-transplant complications included acute CMV disease treated with intravenous ganciclovir and calciphylaxis with a serum calcium level of 14 mg/dl. The patient underwent surgical treatment for tertiary hyperparathyroidism. A: The primary diagnosis is type I diabetes with complications including obesity, renal failure, secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism, and post-transplant complications such as CMV disease and calciphylaxis. Differential diagnoses previously considered include eligibility for renal transplant or SPK, which was initially contraindicated due to obesity. P: The management plan included bariatric surgery (RYGBP) to manage obesity and enable eligibility for SPK transplant. Post-transplant, the patient was managed with a regimen of immunosuppressive medications and treated for acute CMV disease and calciphylaxis. Ongoing management includes close monitoring of renal and pancreatic graft function, immunosuppression levels, and serum calcium levels. Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor for any further complications or recurrence of hyperparathyroidism. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing progressive confusion and weakness for the past two weeks. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your medical history? Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with stage IIIA, estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the breast four years ago. Doctor: Oh, I understand. What treatments have you undergone for your breast cancer? Patient: I had a mastectomy and adjuvant therapy with adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, radiation, and anastrozole. Then, three years after my diagnosis, I developed bone metastasis and received local radiation, exemestane, and everolimus. Doctor: How did your body react to the everolimus treatment? Patient: I was unable to tolerate everolimus, so my therapy was changed to palbociclib and fulvestrant. Doctor: Were there any signs of disease recurrence while you were on that regimen? Patient: No, there was no evidence of disease recurrence for more than a year. But in the months leading up to my hospitalization, my serum levels of cancer antigen and carcinoembryonic antigen began to rise. Doctor: Hmm, did you undergo any further testing to determine the cause of the increase in tumor markers? Patient: Yes, I had a physical exam, imaging tests like bone scan, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography, but there was no evidence of disease recurrence. Doctor: What about your lab results? Patient: My lab results showed hypercalcemia with corrected calcium at 11.9 mg/dL, transaminitis with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 88 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 45 U/L, and hyperbilirubinemia with total bilirubin at 1.8 mg/dL. Doctor: Were there any abnormalities found in the MRI of your brain? Patient: No, the MRI of my brain revealed no abnormalities. Doctor: How about your parathyroid hormone and ammonia levels? Patient: I had parathyroid hormone-independent hypercalcemia and an elevated ammonia level of 95 µmol/L. Doctor: It seems that your hypercalcemia may be due to a paraneoplastic syndrome. What treatment were you given for that? Patient: I was started on gemcitabine. Doctor: Did you undergo any additional imaging tests, such as an abdominal MRI? Patient: Yes, the abdominal MRI showed a normal appearing liver with a moderate volume of ascites. Doctor: What did the cytology of the ascites fluid reveal? Patient: The fluid confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma, which is consistent with my known history of breast cancer. Doctor: So you continued with the gemcitabine treatment. How did your mental status, hypercalcemia, and ammonia level change? Patient: They improved after I continued with gemcitabine treatment. Doctor: That's good to hear. Please continue monitoring your symptoms, and if they worsen or new symptoms arise, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare team. We'll do our best to support you throughout your treatment journey. [/INST] S: The patient, a 58-year-old female with a history of stage IIIA, estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the breast, reports progressive confusion and weakness over the past two weeks. She has undergone various treatments including mastectomy, adjuvant therapy, and medications for bone metastasis. She reports intolerance to everolimus, with subsequent changes to palbociclib and fulvestrant. She notes no evidence of disease recurrence for over a year, although recent months showed rising tumor markers. O: The patient's recent lab results indicate hypercalcemia with a corrected calcium level of 11.9 mg/dL (normal range: 8.5-10.2 mg/dL), transaminitis with AST at 88 U/L (normal range: 10-40 U/L) and ALT at 45 U/L (normal range: 7-56 U/L), and hyperbilirubinemia with total bilirubin at 1.8 mg/dL (normal range: 0.1-1.2 mg/dL). MRI of the brain showed no abnormalities. Elevated ammonia level at 95 µmol/L (normal range: 15-45 µmol/L). Abdominal MRI revealed a normal appearing liver with moderate ascites. Cytology confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma in ascites fluid. A: The primary diagnosis is metastatic breast cancer with complications including paraneoplastic syndrome manifesting as hypercalcemia and elevated ammonia levels. Differential diagnosis includes recurrence of primary cancer, although imaging and tests have not confirmed new disease sites. The prognosis is guarded due to the metastatic nature of the disease and the complications associated with paraneoplastic syndromes. P: The patient will continue treatment with gemcitabine to manage the paraneoplastic syndrome and metastatic disease. Regular monitoring of calcium, liver enzymes, bilirubin, and ammonia levels is recommended. The patient should maintain regular follow-ups with oncology for reassessment of her treatment regimen and symptom management. Education on symptom monitoring and when to seek immediate care is crucial. Referral to palliative care for symptom management and support should be considered to improve quality of life. </s>"

The muscle strength in your left upper and lower limbs is reduced (grade III–IV), while the muscle strength in your right limbs is normal. Abdominal reflex and cremasteric reflex are normal, and pathological reflexes such as Babinski, Chaddock, Oppenheim, and Gordon are negative. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We also conducted a blood test, and the results are as follows: White blood cell count is 10.82 × 10^9, neutrophils at 92%, C-reactive protein at 80 mg/L, and blood glucose at 7. We'll continue to monitor your condition and provide the necessary treatment. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases, reports a 4-day history of fever, skin rash on hands and feet, headache, and weakness in lower limbs. Symptoms progressed to include intraoral and throat pain, non-projectile vomiting, drowsiness, startle, hand tremor, urinary incontinence, and deteriorating consciousness. The patient had recent contact with someone with Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) and has been taking over-the-counter analgesics for pain. O: On admission, vital signs were: temperature 36.8 °C, respiratory rate 25/min, pulse rate 98 beats/min, and blood pressure 124/76 mmHg. Physical examination revealed vesicular lesions and ulcers in oral mucosa, and macular and vesicular lesions on palms and soles. Neurological examination showed left-sided facial paralysis, flat left nasolabial fold, mouth drooping to the left, pupils 4 mm with symmetrical light reflex, normal neck resistance, reduced muscle strength in left limbs (grade III-IV), normal abdominal and cremasteric reflexes, and negative pathological reflexes. Laboratory tests showed white blood cell count at 10.82 × 10^9/L, neutrophils at 92%, C-reactive protein at 80 mg/L, and blood glucose at 7 mmol/L. A: The primary diagnosis is severe Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease with neurological complications including facial paralysis and muscle weakness. Differential diagnoses could include other viral encephalitides or meningitis, considering the neurological symptoms. P: The management plan includes continued monitoring of vital signs and neurological status, supportive care with hydration and fever management, and specific antiviral therapy if indicated based on further virological testing. Pain management will continue with adjustments to analgesics as needed. Patient education will focus on the nature of the disease, transmission prevention, and signs of potential complications requiring immediate attention. Referral to a neurologist is planned for further assessment and management of neurological symptoms. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor recovery and manage any long-term sequelae. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that you have a history of metastatic prostate cancer with metastases throughout your spine, including large vertebral metastases from L2-L5, which has caused pathologic fractures at these levels. Can you tell me how you have been feeling recently? Patient: Hi, doctor. Yeah, for the past few months, I've been experiencing severe axial low back and groin pain. It's been tough. Doctor: I see. Have you had any lower extremity radiculopathy or symptoms of neurogenic claudication? Patient: No, I don't think I've had any of those symptoms. Doctor: That's good to hear. Based on your condition, your life expectancy is estimated to be around 6-12 months. We initially treated you with radiation therapy, which provided relief of your groin pain but didn't have any significant effect on your low back pain. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. My groin pain got better, but my low back pain is still bothering me. Doctor: After that, you underwent vertebroplasty to L2, L3, and L4, which provided partial relief of your symptoms. However, the L5 vertebral body wasn't a suitable target for vertebroplasty due to the fracture at that level resulting in violation of the posterior vertebral body wall. Have you continued to experience load- and movement-dependent low back pain since then? Patient: Yes, it's been quite difficult. My mobility is limited, and I've been relying on opiates to control the pain. It's negatively impacted my quality of life. Doctor: I understand how frustrating that can be. I also noticed that you tried using a lumbrosacral orthosis, and it mildly but incompletely improved your pain. In light of your persistent low back pain and the contraindication to vertebroplasty of an L5 pathologic fracture, we believe that you would benefit from an L4-S1 fixation. The primary goal of this operation is to provide symptomatic relief of axial low back pain while minimizing operative morbidity and recovery time. Are you open to undergoing this procedure? Patient: Yes, I'm willing to try anything that could help relieve my pain. Doctor: Great. For this operation, we'll be using image-guided percutaneous pedicle screw instrumentation and internal fixation. Due to your osteoporosis and overall poor bone quality secondary to diffuse spinal metastases, we'll also perform PMMA-augmentation of the fusion construct. Patient: I see. What does that mean for the procedure? Doctor: Percutaneous pedicle screw placement at L4 and S1 will be performed with the assistance of an O-arm and a StealthStation S7 Surgical Navigation System. This will help us accurately place the screws and minimize any potential complications. We'll also place a percutaneous image-guidance reference pin into your right iliac during the procedure. Patient: Okay, I trust your judgment. I just hope this helps with the pain. Doctor: I understand your concerns, and we'll do our best to ensure a successful outcome. After the operation, we'll closely monitor your recovery and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance through this difficult time. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of metastatic prostate cancer and vertebral metastases from L2-L5 causing pathologic fractures, reports severe axial low back and groin pain. He states that radiation therapy alleviated his groin pain but not his low back pain. He underwent vertebroplasty to L2-L3-L4, which partially relieved his symptoms; however, L5 was not treated due to structural concerns. The patient continues to experience significant pain, affecting his mobility and quality of life, and relies on opiates for pain management. He expresses willingness to undergo further surgical intervention to alleviate his pain. O: The patient has a history of metastatic prostate cancer with spinal involvement. Previous interventions include radiation therapy and vertebroplasty, with partial symptom relief. The patient has no symptoms of lower extremity radiculopathy or neurogenic claudication. Life expectancy is estimated at 6-12 months. Physical examination and imaging were not detailed in the dialogue but are implied through the discussion of surgical options and previous treatments. A: The primary diagnosis is metastatic prostate cancer with spinal metastases and resultant pathologic fractures. The patient's persistent low back pain is due to the structural damage and inadequate response to previous treatments. Differential diagnoses such as radiculopathy and neurogenic claudication have been clinically ruled out based on the patient's symptomatology. P: The proposed management plan includes surgical intervention with L4-S1 fixation using image-guided percutaneous pedicle screw instrumentation and PMMA-augmentation to address the patient's axial low back pain and improve his quality of life. Postoperative care will involve close monitoring of recovery and adjustment of pain management strategies. The patient will be educated on the procedure details and postoperative expectations to ensure understanding and compliance. Further consultations with oncology and pain management specialists may be necessary to optimize overall care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you're here for an evaluation of a palpable mass in your right groin area. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've noticed a lump in my right groin area, and it's been causing some discomfort. Doctor: I see. We performed a computed tomography and it revealed that you have a right indirect inguinal hernia containing the small intestine. Do you have any history of medical issues? Patient: Yes, I have Hunter syndrome. I've been admitted to the hospital multiple times for pediatric treatments for pneumonia, heart failure, and convulsions since birth. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. I also noticed that you are relatively small in stature, with a height of 133.7 cm and weight of 36.6 kg. We observed no apparent hernia on the left side, but there is a wide hernia orifice. Therefore, we decided to perform a laparoscopic surgery instead of an anterior approach to check for any hidden hernias on the left side. Patient: Okay, so what happened during the surgery? Doctor: We performed a TAPP repair for your right-side inguinal hernia after confirming, through laparoscopy, that there was no hernia on the left side. We inserted a 12-mm trocar in your umbilicus and identified the inguinal hernia on the right side and the absence of a hernia on the left side. Patient: What happened next? Doctor: We inserted 5-mm trocars in your bilateral flank regions. Insertion of the trocars was quite difficult due to the softness of your abdominal wall, which may be related to your Hunter syndrome. We then cut the peritoneum outside of the hernia orifice and identified the spermatic cord and testicular artery. Patient: Were there any complications? Doctor: There were some challenges. We had to dissect the preperitoneal space with gauze and be very careful around a network of veins near the spermatic cord and testicular artery to avoid hemorrhage. Patient: So, how did you fix the hernia? Doctor: We inserted a prosthetic mesh, measuring 16.0 × 10.8 cm, into the preperitoneal space and tacked it onto either side of the inferior epigastric artery, transverse abdominal muscle, abdominal rectus muscle, and Cooper's ligament. This completely covered the hernia orifice. Patient: And what about closing the area? Doctor: We closed the peritoneum by suturing it. The operation involved minimal bleeding but took 1 hour and 53 minutes to complete due to the softness of your abdominal wall. Patient: I see. Is there anything I need to do for follow-up care? Doctor: Just make sure to attend your scheduled follow-up appointments and let us know if you experience any unusual symptoms or complications. We will monitor your recovery closely. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, a male with Hunter syndrome, presented with a chief complaint of a palpable mass in the right groin area, causing discomfort. He has a significant medical history of multiple hospital admissions for pneumonia, heart failure, and convulsions since birth. O: Physical examination confirmed a right indirect inguinal hernia containing the small intestine. Computed tomography and laparoscopic findings supported the diagnosis, with no hernia detected on the left side. The patient's stature is notably small, with a height of 133.7 cm and weight of 36.6 kg. During surgery, a prosthetic mesh was placed to repair the hernia, and the operation lasted 1 hour and 53 minutes with minimal bleeding but noted difficulty due to the softness of the abdominal wall, likely related to Hunter syndrome. A: The primary diagnosis is right indirect inguinal hernia. The differential diagnosis included potential bilateral hernias, which was ruled out via laparoscopy. The patient's underlying Hunter syndrome complicates the surgical approach and postoperative recovery due to the softness of the abdominal wall and potential for other systemic involvements. P: The patient underwent a successful TAPP repair with prosthetic mesh placement for the right inguinal hernia. Postoperative instructions include attending scheduled follow-up appointments and monitoring for any unusual symptoms or complications. The patient's recovery will be closely monitored due to the complexities introduced by Hunter syndrome. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I'm here because I have acromegaly and I'm struggling with my glucose control. Doctor: I see. We recently performed an MRI and CT scan on you, and they showed a 3.9 × 2.4 × 3.3 cm space-occupying lesion in the sella turcica region. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms? Patient: Hmm, not really. I just noticed that my glucose levels have been off lately. Doctor: Based on the test results, we've diagnosed you with a pituitary macroadenoma. Our preoperative endocrine examinations also showed that you have elevated growth hormone levels.  Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Don't worry, we're here to help you. We employed 3D-printing technology to reconstruct a model of your tumor, which will be useful in planning your treatment. We've also used the model to communicate your condition to your relatives. Patient: That's great. So, what do you recommend for my treatment? Doctor: We recommend that you undergo a two-step treatment. First, a transsphenoidal surgery to remove the intrasellar tumor, and then a craniotomy to remove the suprasellar tumor. Patient: Okay, and how did the communication with my family go? Doctor: The communication went well. We were able to discuss your condition and the planned surgical approach using the 3D-printed model. This helped us practice the surgical manipulation, providing important guidance for the surgery. Patient: That's good to hear. What did the examination of my tumor show? Doctor: The pathological examination revealed that your tumor is a growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma. Patient: I see. What can I expect after the surgery? Doctor: After the surgery, you shouldn't experience any complications, and you'll be discharged once you've recovered. Three months later, you'll come back to our hospital for the craniotomy, and we'll fully resect the tumor. Patient: Thank you for explaining everything. I feel much more confident about the treatment now. Doctor: You're welcome. We're here to support you throughout this process. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. [/INST] S: The patient presents with acromegaly and reports difficulty in controlling glucose levels. No additional symptoms were noted. O: Recent MRI and CT scans revealed a 3.9 × 2.4 × 3.3 cm space-occupying lesion in the sella turcica. Preoperative endocrine examinations indicated elevated growth hormone levels. A 3D-printed model of the tumor was created for surgical planning and patient education. A: The primary diagnosis is a growth hormone-secreting pituitary macroadenoma, specifically located in the sella turcica with suprasellar extension. The patient's glucose control issues are likely exacerbated by the hormone-secreting nature of the tumor. P: The recommended treatment plan includes a two-step surgical approach: initially, a transsphenoidal surgery to remove the intrasellar tumor, followed by a craniotomy to address the suprasellar extension. Postoperative follow-up is planned three months after the initial surgery to perform the craniotomy. The patient has been educated about the condition and the surgical procedure using a 3D model, which also facilitated family communication and surgical planning. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I understand you're here today because your mother noticed some asymptomatic white patches on your skin. Can you tell me when she first noticed these? Patient: Yeah, my mom first noticed them about 4 years ago before this presentation. Doctor: I see. How was your mother's pregnancy and your birth history? Were there any complications or issues? Patient: No, my mom's pregnancy and my birth history were both unremarkable. Doctor: Hmm, okay. Have you experienced any difficulty feeding since birth? Patient: Yes, I've had difficulty feeding since birth. I even needed a gastric tube placement. Doctor: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you had any recurrent hospitalizations for conditions like aspiration pneumonia? Patient: Yes, I've been hospitalized a few times because of aspiration pneumonia. Doctor: I see. During your clinical examination, we noticed some distinctive coarse facial features such as bushy arched eyebrows, thick everted lips, a broad nasal bridge, facial nevi, and developmental delay. Have you ever had any metabolic or genetic testing done? Patient: Yes, when I was 11 years old, I had genetic testing and a diagnosis of CSS was established through whole-exome sequencing. Doctor: The sequencing revealed a de novo mutation (c.4202G>T, p.E1402X) in the ARID1B gene, which is a premature stop codon mutation leading to a truncated protein. This mutation was not found in either of your parents or your two unaffected older sisters, correct? Patient: That's right, the mutation wasn't found in any of them. Doctor: In addition to the distinctive coarse facial features, your clinical examination also showed fifth finger hypoplasia, first metatarsal hypermobility, and hypertrichosis characteristic of CSS. There were also depigmented macules and patches on your elbows, knees, and malleoli, which are clinically characteristic of vitiligo. Are you aware of these? Patient: Yes, I've noticed those too. Doctor: We also observed over 60 brown macules consistent with melanocytic nevi, under 5 mm in size, on your face, neck, abdomen, trunk, extremities, palms, and soles, with some up to 1.0 cm. Halo nevi were not present. Do you recall when these nevi first appeared? Patient: My parents said the onset of nevi was around when I was 3 years old. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Neither of your parents has multiple nevi, correct? Patient: No, they don't have multiple nevi. Doctor: Alright. Based on your clinical presentation and genetic testing, it's important to continue monitoring your skin and overall health. Please follow up with your primary care physician and a dermatologist regularly for check-ups. If you notice any changes in the size, color, or shape of your nevi, or if you develop new symptoms, please contact your doctor immediately. Patient: Okay, I will. Thank you for your help, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, a child, presented with asymptomatic white patches on the skin, first noticed by the mother approximately 4 years ago. The patient has a history of difficulty feeding since birth, requiring gastric tube placement, and recurrent hospitalizations for aspiration pneumonia. The patient was diagnosed with Coffin-Siris Syndrome (CSS) at age 11, confirmed by genetic testing which identified a de novo mutation in the ARID1B gene. The patient also reports the appearance of multiple melanocytic nevi since age 3. O: Clinical examination revealed coarse facial features, including bushy arched eyebrows, thick everted lips, a broad nasal bridge, facial nevi, and developmental delay. Additional findings included fifth finger hypoplasia, first metatarsal hypermobility, hypertrichosis, and depigmented macules and patches on elbows, knees, and malleoli, characteristic of vitiligo. Over 60 brown macules under 5 mm in size were observed across various body parts, with some up to 1.0 cm. No halo nevi were present. Genetic testing confirmed a premature stop codon mutation (c.4202G>T, p.E1402X) in the ARID1B gene, not present in immediate family members. A: The primary diagnosis is Coffin-Siris Syndrome with associated vitiligo and multiple melanocytic nevi. The genetic findings support the diagnosis of CSS due to the identified mutation in the ARID1B gene. The presence of vitiligo and extensive melanocytic nevi requires ongoing dermatological evaluation to monitor for potential complications such as skin cancer. P: The management plan includes regular follow-ups with a primary care physician and a dermatologist to monitor the patient's skin condition and overall health. The patient and caregivers should be educated on the signs of changes in the nevi that might suggest malignancy and advised to report any new symptoms or changes immediately. Genetic counseling for the family may also be beneficial to discuss the implications of the de novo mutation and the risk to future offspring. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, Ms. K. What brings you in today? Ms. K: Hi, doctor. I've been having watery eyes, chest pain, lower back and joint pain, leg cramps, and weakness lately. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's discuss your medical history to better understand your symptoms. I can see that you first visited a cardiologist in 2013 with intermittent episodes of chest pain over six months. An electrocardiogram was done, and it showed bradycardia, a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, and a left bundle branch block. Do you recall this? Ms. K: Yes, I remember that visit. I also mentioned some non-specific complaints, which I thought were because of a ""hematological problem."" Doctor: I see. You were later evaluated for renal hypertension, and imaging studies showed a renal cyst. Did you follow up with a nephrologist? Ms. K: No, I didn't. But I continued to make hospital visits for persistent chest pain, and every time, they said everything was normal. Doctor: I understand. I also see a note in your prior medical records mentioning the disappearance of your kidneys. Can you tell me more about that? Ms. K: Well, I claimed that the Russian military entered my residence and stole my urine, which resulted in my kidneys disappearing. Doctor: That must have been distressing for you. It's important to note that our medical team found no evidence of missing kidneys. Now, I want to address your current concerns. You seem to have delusions about having high blood pressure, uterine cancer, blood cancer with bone metastasis, and brain cancer with extensive metastasis. Can you tell me why you believe you have these conditions? Ms. K: I'm convinced I have cancer because I used to be a practicing neurologist in my home country. I also think my doctors, both here and back home, are hiding the truth about my oncological issues. Doctor: It's important to trust your medical team, Ms. K. We're here to help you. I must say, you've had a full medical workup during your hospital visits, and everything was found to be normal. Do you remember the incident where you threatened to burn down your primary doctor's office? Ms. K: Yes, I was angry and felt that my doctors were not taking my concerns seriously. I didn't actually want to harm anyone. Doctor: I understand your frustration, but it's important to handle these situations appropriately. Now, you've vehemently denied having any psychiatric illness, stating that these diagnoses appeared on your records because of a rumor started by an envious former colleague. Is that correct? Ms. K: Yes, that's what I believe. Doctor: Thank you for sharing your perspective, Ms. K. Given your symptoms and history, I recommend further evaluation to rule out any underlying medical conditions. However, it's also essential to consider the possibility of a psychiatric component to your symptoms. I'll arrange a follow-up appointment for you with a specialist to address your concerns. In the meantime, please let us know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Ms. K: Okay, thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: Ms. K presents with symptoms of watery eyes, chest pain, lower back and joint pain, leg cramps, and weakness. She has a history of intermittent chest pain since 2013, diagnosed with bradycardia, first-degree AV block, and left bundle branch block. Ms. K also reported non-specific complaints suspected to be hematological in nature and was evaluated for renal hypertension, revealing a renal cyst. She has delusions regarding her health, including beliefs of having high blood pressure, uterine cancer, blood cancer with bone metastasis, and brain cancer with extensive metastasis. She denies any psychiatric illness, attributing such diagnoses to rumors by a former colleague. O: Previous electrocardiogram showed bradycardia, first-degree AV block, and left bundle branch block. Imaging studies indicated a renal cyst. No evidence of missing kidneys or the extensive cancers Ms. K believes she has. All other medical workups have been normal. A: The primary assessment includes delusional disorder with somatic delusions, given her unfounded beliefs about having multiple cancers and other health issues despite normal medical evaluations. Differential diagnoses could include a primary psychiatric disorder influencing her perception of physical health. The history of cardiac issues and renal cyst are noted but do not currently explain her wide range of symptoms. P: Plan to refer Ms. K for a psychiatric evaluation to address potential delusional disorder and manage her somatic concerns. Continue monitoring her cardiac status and renal cyst with routine follow-ups. Educate Ms. K on the importance of psychiatric evaluation in understanding and managing her symptoms. Encourage her to maintain open communication with healthcare providers and report any new or worsening symptoms. Address compliance and trust issues in the therapeutic relationship. </s>"

What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, doc. I've been having fever, chills, and feeling weak lately. Doctor: I see. You were previously admitted for left foot MRSA osteomyelitis, is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. During that hospitalization, I had a heart attack too. Doctor: I understand. You had source control with BKA of your left leg and later had CABG, AVR for severe aortic stenosis, and MVR for severe mitral regurgitation. You were discharged with a six-week course of vancomycin, but it was extended due to a wound from the BKA that required skin graft surgery. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, doc. That's what happened. Doctor: So you were readmitted 88 days after cardiac surgery for MRSA bacteremia, which was attributed to cellulitis of the BKA stump or endocarditis. Your Transthoracic echocardiogram at that time was negative for PVE. Do you recall this? Patient: Yes, I remember. They treated me with vancomycin for six weeks, and the cellulitis got better. Doctor: Unfortunately, five days after completing antibiotics, you presented with MRSA bacteremia again, which progressed to VISA bacteremia with a vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration of 4 μg/mL. You were then started on daptomycin, ceftaroline, and rifampin for the VISA bacteremia. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's what they told me. Doctor: Your recent TEE showed aortic root thickening, suggestive of an abscess with an associated structural defect, a mobile 2.4 cm × 1.9 cm echodensity projecting into the right atrium, and left to right shunting. This could be a serious issue. Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: You subsequently underwent cardiac surgery for a redo AVR with a bovine pericardial tissue valve and patch repair of the aorta to right atrial fistula. How are you feeling since the surgery? Patient: I'm not feeling great, but I'm hanging in there. Doctor: It's important to closely monitor your condition and follow up with your healthcare providers. Please let us know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Patient: Okay, doc. I'll make sure to keep an eye on my condition and contact you if anything changes. Doctor: Thank you for letting me know about your history and current condition. We will do our best to help you in managing your health. Take care. Patient: Thank you, doc. I really appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, below-knee amputation (BKA) of the left leg, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), aortic valve replacement (AVR), and mitral valve replacement (MVR) with bioprosthetic valves. He presents with complaints of fever, chills, and general weakness. He has a past medical history significant for left foot MRSA osteomyelitis, myocardial infarction, MRSA bacteremia, and VISA bacteremia. He reports a recent cardiac surgery for redo AVR and repair of an aortic root abscess. O: The patient was previously treated with a six-week course of vancomycin, extended due to complications from the BKA wound. He was readmitted for MRSA bacteremia, treated with vancomycin, and later with daptomycin, ceftaroline, and rifampin for VISA bacteremia. Recent transthoracic echocardiogram (TEE) showed aortic root thickening, suggestive of an abscess, and a structural defect with a 2.4 cm × 1.9 cm echodensity projecting into the right atrium. A: The primary diagnosis is recurrent MRSA and VISA bacteremia secondary to prosthetic valve endocarditis and post-surgical complications. Differential diagnoses include sepsis and recurrent osteomyelitis. The prognosis is guarded due to the complexity of the patient's medical history and the severity of his infections. P: Continue close monitoring of the patient's condition with regular follow-ups. Maintain current antibiotic regimen as per infectious disease recommendations. Schedule regular echocardiograms to monitor valve function and detect any further complications. Educate the patient on signs of infection and the importance of adherence to the treatment plan. Ensure coordination among cardiology, infectious disease, and primary care to manage the patient's complex conditions. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having headaches for a while now, and it's really affecting my daily life. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me ask you a few questions to better understand your situation. How long have you been experiencing these headaches? Patient: I've had them since I was 10 years old. I'm 16 now. Doctor: Okay. Have you had any neurological examinations done before? Patient: Yes, I had one and the findings were normal. Doctor: Alright. I've looked at your CT images, and it shows spotty calcification in the bilateral globus pallidus and caudate nuclei, as well as mild calcification in the thalamus, subcortical white matter, and dentate nuclei. Patient: Oh, no. Is that bad, Doctor? Doctor: It's not ideal, but we need to monitor it closely and see if it progresses with age. I noticed that your mother also has the same variant and presented with headaches. She has prominent calcification in the bilateral globus pallidus, caudate nuclei, thalamus, dentate nuclei, and subcortical white matter.  Patient: Yes, my mom suffers from headaches too. Doctor: Your third brother also had a CT scan when he encountered a traffic accident. Although he was asymptomatic, he showed mild calcification in the globus pallidus. Considering his age, this calcification is pathologic, with a total calcification score of 6. The calcification in other regions of the brain, including the dentate nuclei of the cerebellum, could not be detected. Patient: I didn't know that about my brother. Doctor: DNA analysis revealed that your third brother has the same variant as you and your mother. However, your eldest brother did not present with the variant, and no calcification was observed on his CT images. Patient: Oh, that's good for him, I guess. Doctor: Yes, it seems that he didn't inherit the variant. As for your younger sister, she's currently in a nursing institution due to mental retardation, and we don't have detailed clinical information about her condition. Patient: Yeah, my sister has been in the institution for some time now. Doctor: It's important that we continue to monitor your condition and symptoms. Make sure to schedule regular checkups, and don't hesitate to reach out if you experience any changes or worsening in your headaches. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to do that. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and I hope your headaches improve soon. [/INST] S: The patient, a 16-year-old, reports experiencing headaches since age 10, which significantly impact daily activities. The patient's family history is notable for similar symptoms; the mother and a sibling also suffer from headaches, and another sibling has asymptomatic brain calcifications. O: Neurological examinations previously conducted on the patient were normal. Recent CT imaging shows spotty calcification in the bilateral globus pallidus and caudate nuclei, with mild calcification in the thalamus, subcortical white matter, and dentate nuclei. The patient's mother and one brother exhibit similar calcifications, while another brother does not present with the genetic variant or calcifications. The patient's younger sister is in a nursing institution for mental retardation, but detailed clinical information is unavailable. A: The primary diagnosis is a familial genetic disorder characterized by brain calcifications, likely contributing to the patient's chronic headaches. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of chronic headaches, but the genetic link and imaging findings support the primary diagnosis. The prognosis depends on the progression of calcifications and management of symptoms. P: The management plan includes regular neurological checkups to monitor the progression of calcifications and symptoms. The patient is advised to maintain a headache diary and report any changes in frequency or intensity. Referral to a genetic counselor is recommended to discuss the implications of the familial variant. Education on headache management, including lifestyle modifications and potential medication options, will be provided. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to reassess the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that you presented to the emergency room with a complaint of left thigh pain and an inability to walk after tumbling. Can you tell me more about that? Patient: Yes, I've been suffering from osteoarthritis in my left hip for a while now. I was able to walk with a cane and sit on a couch, but after I fell, I just couldn't walk anymore. Doctor: I see. Have you been taking any medications for your osteoarthritis or any other conditions? Patient: I have been diagnosed with osteoporosis, and I've been taking alendronate 35 mg weekly for six years. Doctor: Thank you for that information. We took a radiograph when you arrived in the emergency room, and it showed a non-comminuted subtrochanteric fracture of your left femur with cortical thickness and beaking of the lateral cortex at the fracture site. The fracture line was transverse on the lateral side and oblique on the medial side. Based on the radiographic findings and the weakness of the force that caused the fracture, it seems to satisfy the criteria for an atypical fracture of the femur. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: The radiograph also showed Kellgren-Lawrence grade 4 osteoarthritis of your left hip, with superomedial migration, external rotation of the femoral head, and shortening of the femoral neck. We initially planned for osteosynthesis with intramedullary nailing to fix the fracture. Patient: Is that the best option for me? Doctor: We considered that, but the deformity of your hip joint appeared to preclude correct nail insertion. We also realized that using a fracture table, as we have in the past, often results in varus malalignment due to the perineal post impeding the adduction of the proximal fragment of the subtrochanteric fracture. Patient: So what did you decide to do? Doctor: We decided to fix the fracture with a nail in the lateral decubitus position, which allows for easy access to the entry point without using the perineal post. We didn't choose total hip arthroplasty with fracture fixation because it would have been inappropriate given the rather mild pre-injury symptoms due to your osteoarthritis, and because you expressed a desire to preserve your femoral head. Patient: Okay, I understand. What happened during the surgery? Doctor: In the surgery, we used a flat, radiolucent operating table. The whole injured leg was sterilized and draped to ensure a clean and safe procedure. Patient: Thank you for explaining everything to me. What should I do now to ensure a proper recovery? Doctor: It's important to follow the post-operative care instructions provided to you and attend all follow-up appointments. This will help ensure that your recovery goes smoothly and that any complications are addressed promptly. [/INST] S: The patient, who has a history of osteoarthritis in the left hip and osteoporosis, presented with left thigh pain and inability to walk following a fall. The patient has been taking alendronate 35 mg weekly for osteoporosis. O: Radiographic examination revealed a non-comminuted subtrochanteric fracture of the left femur with specific features suggesting an atypical fracture. Additionally, severe osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 4) of the left hip was noted, with significant joint deformity. Surgery was performed using a lateral decubitus position to avoid complications associated with traditional positioning methods. A: The primary diagnosis is an atypical subtrochanteric fracture of the left femur, secondary to osteoporosis and exacerbated by existing osteoarthritis. The patient's osteoporosis and the minimal force involved in the injury contributed to the atypical nature of the fracture. P: Post-operative management includes adherence to care instructions and regular follow-up appointments to monitor healing and manage any complications. The patient was advised against total hip arthroplasty due to mild pre-injury symptoms and a desire to preserve the femoral head. The focus is on recovery and rehabilitation to regain mobility and prevent future fractures. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I had a pyeloplasty for my right pelviureteric junction obstruction a while ago. I've been diabetic for 10 years and developed kidney disease 5 years ago. Recently, I've been experiencing fever with chills, burning micturition, and right flank pain. Doctor: I see. Let's do a thorough examination.  (After examination) Doctor: Your examination results show that you are febrile. We also did a urine test, which showed 32 white blood cells/hpf and 1 bacteria/hpf. Your creatinine level is 3.9 mg dl–1, which prevents us from administering contrast for imaging.  Patient: Oh, I see. What's the next step, then? Doctor: We'll perform a CT scan and an MRI to get a better understanding of your condition.  (After imaging) Doctor: The CT imaging showed perinephric fat stranding and hydronephrosis with sudden tapering of the right ureter at the pelviureteric junction. The MRI revealed hydronephrosis of the right kidney with sudden tapering at the level of the pelviureteric junction. There's also diffusion restriction at the tip of the renal pyramid, widening of the fornices, clubbing of the calyces, and filling defects in the lower pole and interpolar calyx. Additionally, a cleft was noted at the lower pole. These findings suggest a right pelviureteric junction stricture with papillary necrosis. Patient: That sounds serious. What does that mean for me? Doctor: It's important to address this issue as soon as possible. We also tested your urine for bacterial and fungal growth. There was no growth of bacteria, but we did find Candida species other than Candida albicans in the fungal culture. Patient: What's the treatment plan? Doctor: We'll start you on broad-spectrum antibiotics and systemic antifungals to treat the infection. This should help resolve your fever and flank pain. We'll monitor your urinary white blood cell count to ensure it returns to normal. Patient: Alright, I'll follow the treatment plan. When can I expect to feel better? Doctor: You should begin to see improvement in your symptoms as the treatment progresses. We'll re-evaluate your condition after the treatment and make sure the urine culture is normal. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any concerns or questions during your treatment, please don't hesitate to reach out. [/INST] S: The patient reports a history of right pelviureteric junction obstruction treated with pyeloplasty, diabetes for 10 years, and kidney disease for 5 years.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Good morning. I see from your history that you are in your late 30s and have a history of SLE characterized by positive anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-Smith antibodies (1:160), anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (anti-dsDNA) antibodies (> 1:640), anti-ribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP) antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-cardiolipin antibodies (27, normal: 0 - 12 U/ml), hypocomplementemia (C3 < 40, normal: 90 - 165 mg/dl; C4 < 8, normal: 10 - 40 mg/dl), rheumatoid factor of 50 IU/mL (negative: < 13.9), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), arthritis, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. What brings you to our clinic today? Patient: Good morning, doctor. I've been experiencing new proteinuria, and I'm quite concerned about it. Doctor: I understand your concern. Let's start by discussing your recent test results. Your spot urine protein/creatinine ratio is 1,059 mg/g, which is quite high, but your creatinine level is normal at 0.6 mg/dl. We also evaluated your antibodies of perinuclear (p)-ANCA, cytoplasmic (c)-ANCA, and atypical p-ANCA, which were all negative. We performed a renal biopsy to further investigate the issue.  Patient: What did the renal biopsy show, doctor? Doctor: The renal biopsy demonstrated focal, mild necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis. Glomerular staining showed non-specific 1+ linear staining of the glomerular basement membrane and rare 1+ granular mesangial staining for IgG, IgM, and kappa but with negative staining for immunoglobulin A (IgA), C3, C1q, and lambda. In summary, the renal biopsy results indicate a pauci-immune focal necrotizing/extracapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis. Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. What's the treatment plan for this issue? Doctor: We started treating you with rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil (3g daily), and prednisone. However, your proteinuria continued with 0.73 g/24 hours, and your creatinine levels remained stable at 0.7 mg/dl. You also showed no hematuria. Patient: So, what's the next step, doctor? Doctor: We decided to perform a second renal biopsy when your serologies demonstrated low C3 at 77 mg/dl and positive anti-dsDNA antibodies. The results resembled class II lupus nephritis, with a limited subcapsular glomerular sample that had deposits staining for IgG and IgM. Patient: What does this mean for my condition and treatment? Doctor: Based on these findings, we need to adjust your treatment plan to better manage your lupus nephritis. We'll continue to monitor your proteinuria and creatinine levels closely. It's important to follow up with us regularly to ensure the best possible outcome. Patient: Okay, doctor. I'll make sure to follow your instructions and keep you updated on my progress. Thank you for your help. Doctor: You're welcome. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I'll see you at your next appointment. [/INST] S: The patient, in their late 30s with a history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), presents with new-onset proteinuria. They express concern about this symptom. O: The patient's spot urine protein/creatinine ratio is significantly elevated at 1,059 mg/g, with a normal creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dl. Recent serologies show low C3 at 77 mg/dl and positive anti-dsDNA antibodies. Initial renal biopsy indicated focal, mild necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis with non-specific immunoglobulin staining. A second renal biopsy suggested class II lupus nephritis. Current medications include rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil (3g daily), and prednisone. Despite treatment, the patient's proteinuria persists at 0.73 g/24 hours, with stable creatinine levels and no hematuria. A: The primary diagnosis is lupus nephritis, evidenced by proteinuria, renal biopsy findings, and a history of SLE. The differential diagnosis includes other causes of glomerulonephritis, though the absence of certain immunoglobulin and complement deposits supports a diagnosis related to SLE. P: The treatment plan includes continuation of rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone, with close monitoring of proteinuria and creatinine levels. Regular follow-ups are scheduled to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and make adjustments as necessary. The patient is advised to maintain regular communication and report any changes or concerns. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I was admitted to the local hospital a week ago due to headache, babbling, and aggressive behaviors. I was treated with penicillin and acyclovir, but my symptoms haven't improved. Doctor: I see. Let's go over your test results. Your enhanced head MRI showed no abnormality. Your CSF pressure was 100 cmH2O, with normal total cell count and leukocyte count. The protein concentration was 0.46 g/L. The anti-NMDAR antibodies in your CSF and serum were 1:1 and 1:10, respectively, and the antibodies against AMPA1, AMPA2, LGI1, CASPR2, and GABAb were negative. We also detected your chest and abdomen with B-ultrasound and CT to exclude any tumors. Your PANSS total score was 97. Patient: Oh, that's a lot of information. What does it all mean? Doctor: Based on these results, we'll start you on a treatment plan. Initially, you'll receive IVIG (25 g/day, 5 days), methylprednisolone (1,000 mg, 3 days + 500 mg, 3 days), and prednisolone (0-60 mg, 12 weeks). After that, we'll begin antipsychotic therapy with olanzapine (10-20 mg/day, 15 days), quetiapine (25-400 mg/day, 15 days), and clonazepam (2-4 mg/day, 30 days). Patient: Okay, and what if my symptoms still don't improve? Doctor: If you still experience visual hallucinations and aggressive behaviors after this treatment, we'll give you clozapine (50-100 mg/day), which has a plasma concentration of 65.3 ng/ml. Patient: How long will it take for my psychiatric symptoms to disappear? Doctor: It may take about 2 months for your symptoms to completely resolve. We'll monitor your progress closely during that time. Patient: Alright, and what can I expect after my treatment is done? Doctor: After 6 months of follow-up, we expect that you'll be able to live and work normally. Your anti-NMDAR antibodies in CSF and serum should be negative, and your PANSS total score should drop to 18. Patient: That sounds promising. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any concerns or questions during your treatment, don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you. [/INST] S: The patient reports persistent symptoms of headache, babbling, and aggressive behaviors despite treatment with penicillin and acyclovir. The patient was previously admitted to a local hospital for these symptoms. O: Enhanced head MRI showed no abnormalities. CSF analysis revealed a pressure of 100 cmH2O, normal total cell and leukocyte counts, and a protein concentration of 0.46 g/L. Anti-NMDAR antibodies were positive in CSF (1:1) and serum (1:10), while antibodies against AMPA1, AMPA2, LGI1, CASPR2, and GABAb were negative. B-ultrasound and CT scans of the chest and abdomen did not reveal any tumors. PANSS total score was 97. A: The patient is diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis based on the presence of anti-NMDAR antibodies and clinical presentation. Differential diagnoses such as other autoimmune encephalitides or infectious causes appear less likely given the test results and lack of response to initial antimicrobial therapy. P: Initiate treatment with IVIG (25 g/day for 5 days), followed by high-dose methylprednisolone (1,000 mg for 3 days, then 500 mg for 3 more days), and a tapering course of prednisolone (0-60 mg over 12 weeks). Antipsychotic therapy will include olanzapine (10-20 mg/day for 15 days), quetiapine (25-400 mg/day for 15 days), and clonazepam (2-4 mg/day for 30 days). If symptoms persist, particularly visual hallucinations and aggressive behaviors, consider adding clozapine (50-100 mg/day). Close monitoring of psychiatric symptoms is planned, with a goal for complete resolution within 2 months and a follow-up period of 6 months to ensure the patient can return to normal life and work activities, with expected negative anti-NMDAR antibodies and a reduced PANSS score to 18. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you've been referred to our bariatric clinic for treatment of your morbid obesity. Can you please tell me a bit about your history with weight and any relevant medical issues? Patient: Sure, I was born with a normal birth weight, but I had a large head circumference. My body weight started to become significantly higher than my peers when I was around five years old. I didn't have any specific life events that could explain my obesity. I had normal cognitive development and education. I also underwent treatment for recurrent nasal polyps. Doctor: I see. It seems like there might be a genetic component to your obesity, especially since your mother also suffered from morbid obesity and had a large head size. She was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and unfortunately passed away from a pulmonary embolism after the placement of an Adjustable Gastric Band. I also noticed in your family history that a maternal aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 50 and the maternal grandmother died from breast cancer at a young age. Does anyone else in your family have obesity or a large head size? Patient: Yes, my younger sister is overweight, and she was also reported to have a large head size. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Have you tried any weight loss programs or treatments in the past? Patient: Yes, since childhood I've tried several different coaching programs to change my eating behavior and exercise pattern. I did lose weight a few times, but I was never able to maintain it. Doctor: I understand, that can be quite challenging. At the time of your intake procedure at our clinic, we measured your height as 1.69 m and weight as 164 kg, resulting in a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 57.6 kg/m2. We didn't measure your head size as it's not part of our bariatric screening procedures. We also conducted a biochemical analysis of your blood, which revealed no abnormalities and excluded endocrine hormonal disorders such as hypothyroidism. Your fasting glucose level was 5.9 mM. Patient: Okay, so what does that all mean for me? Doctor: The combination of your early onset morbid obesity and family history suggests that there might be a genetic cause for your obesity. We can offer you diagnostic genetic analysis of 52 obesity-associated genes to identify a possible underlying genetic cause. Patient: That sounds like a good idea. What about treatment options? Doctor: You are eligible for bariatric surgery, which could help you lose a significant amount of weight. One option is a sleeve gastrectomy, which we can perform without complications. Patient: I'm willing to give that a try. When can we schedule the surgery? Doctor: We can schedule the surgery for sometime in the next few weeks. In the meantime, we'll continue to monitor your health and provide any necessary support. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance. [/INST] S: The patient, referred for treatment of morbid obesity, reports a history of significant weight gain starting at age five, with no specific life events contributing to obesity. The patient has tried multiple weight loss programs with temporary success. Family history includes morbid obesity and large head size in the mother and sister, and early onset cancers in maternal relatives. The patient's mother had thyroid cancer and died from a pulmonary embolism post-bariatric surgery. O: Height 1.69 m, weight 164 kg, BMI 57.6 kg/m2. Biochemical blood analysis showed no endocrine abnormalities; fasting glucose level was 5.9 mM, within normal limits. No head size measurement taken. A: Primary diagnosis of morbid obesity, likely with a genetic component given the family history and early onset. Differential diagnosis could include endocrine disorders, which have been ruled out by biochemical analysis. The patient's history and current health status make them a candidate for bariatric surgery. P: Plan to perform genetic analysis of 52 obesity-associated genes to further investigate genetic causes. The patient is scheduled for sleeve gastrectomy in the coming weeks. Pre-operative preparation and post-operative support will be provided, including dietary counseling and psychological support to aid in weight loss maintenance. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor health and treatment progress. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you tell me what symptoms you've been experiencing recently?

Did you experience any cough, sputum, or myalgia during this time? Patient: No, I didn't have any of those symptoms. Doctor: Okay. How has your mobility been since the onset of these symptoms? Patient: About 4 days after the initial symptoms, I found it difficult to walk, and that's when I was transferred to this hospital. Doctor: Thank you for the information. I understand that you have been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Can you tell me more about your medical history? Patient: Yes, I smoked 10 cigarettes per day from age 18 to 63 years, and I had a resection of lung cancer 2 years ago. Doctor: Do you have any exposure to dust or have you been vaccinated for influenza or S. pneumoniae infections? Patient: I haven't been exposed to dust and I haven't been vaccinated for influenza or pneumoniae infections. Doctor: Alright. On admission, your Glasgow Coma Scale score was E3V4M4 and your vital signs showed a body temperature of 35.1ºC, heart rate of 137 bpm, blood pressure of 70/30 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34/min, and SpO2 of 78% under O2 inhalation at 10 L/min. Auscultation didn't reveal any murmurs, but the air sounds in your right lung fields were attenuated. Patient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: We also performed a blood gas analysis under O2 inhalation at 10 L/min, which showed a pH of 7.36, partial pressure of arterial oxygen of 69.3 Torr, partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide of 32.8 Torr, bicarbonate of 18.2 mmol/L, base excess of -6.3 mmol/L, and lactate of 5.75 mmol/L. Patient: Okay. Doctor: Your peripheral blood tests showed a white blood cell count of 1200/mm3, with neutrophils at 86.1%, lymphocytes at 10.4%, eosinophils at 0%, basophils at 0.9%, and monocytes at 2.6%. Your hemoglobin was 11.8 g/dL, and platelets were 12.8 × 104/mm3. Patient: I see. Doctor: Lastly, your serum biochemistry and serology tests showed aspartate aminotransferase at 55 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase at 19 IU/L, and lactate dehydrogenase at 213 IU/L. Patient: So, what does all this mean, doc? Doctor: Based on your symptoms, vital signs, and test results, we will need to perform further examinations and provide appropriate treatment. It's important to monitor your condition closely and follow up as needed. We'll make sure to keep you informed and provide the best possible care. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, a 63-year-old male with a history of smoking and lung cancer resection, reports experiencing dyspnea on effort, general fatigue, fever of 38ºC, and loss of appetite starting in March 2018. He denies cough, sputum production, or myalgia. He also reports difficulty walking, which began four days after the initial symptoms. The patient has not been vaccinated for influenza or S. pneumoniae and denies dust exposure. O: On admission, vital signs were critical with a body temperature of 35.1ºC, heart rate of 137 bpm, blood pressure of 70/30 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34/min, and SpO2 of 78% under O2 inhalation at 10 L/min.

Serum biochemistry showed AST 55 IU/L, ALT 19 IU/L, and LDH 213 IU/L. A: The patient presents with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), complicated by hypoxemia, hypotension, and leukopenia. Differential diagnoses include pneumonia and sepsis, considering the fever and leukopenia. The history of lung cancer and smoking significantly contributes to his current respiratory issues. P: Immediate management includes stabilizing the patient's vital signs and continuing oxygen therapy. Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential bacterial infections and consider antiviral therapy pending influenza and pneumoniae vaccination status verification. Arrange for a chest X-ray and possibly a CT scan to assess lung status and rule out other complications like pneumonia or recurrence of cancer. Schedule follow-up appointments for continuous monitoring and adjustment of treatment plans. Educate the patient on the importance of vaccination and smoking cessation to prevent further deterioration of lung function. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, Patient B. How have you been feeling lately? Patient B: Hmm, I've been feeling a bit better, I guess. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. So, you were diagnosed with dysthymia, and we prescribed you a daily oral medication of sertraline 100 mg. How has that been working for you? Patient B: Yes, I think it's helping me. I feel like my mood has improved somewhat. Doctor: That's great. We did an assessment of your depression on June 7, 2017, with a PHQ-9 score of 20, and another one on July 5, 2017, with a PHQ-9 score of 8. This shows a significant improvement in your depressive symptoms. Patient B: Oh, that's good to know! Doctor: Yes, it is. In your follow-up, you mentioned an improvement in cognitive performance, a decrease of death thoughts, and improvement of hedonic capacity. Can you tell me more about these changes? Patient B: Well, I've been able to think more clearly and enjoy things more. I don't think about death as much as I used to. Doctor: That's very encouraging. Now, during the study from June 7, 2017, to January 30, 2018, you were using a Samsung Galaxy A5 running Android 6.0.1, right? Patient B: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: We looked at the data from your phone to analyze your mobility patterns. We found 5 different clusters, but it seems that your most common profile was a low-mobility one with not a single hour with more than 1 km traveled.  Patient B: Yeah, I don't move around much. Doctor: In your case, the clinical changes in your depression did not correlate with mobility, as your main symptoms were expressed in cognitive and hedonic areas. However, it's still essential to monitor your overall well-being. Patient B: Okay, I understand. Doctor: It's great to see your improvement, but please continue taking your prescribed medication and let me know if you experience any changes in your symptoms. We'll keep monitoring your progress. Patient B: Alright, thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: Patient B reports feeling somewhat better since starting treatment with sertraline 100 mg daily for dysthymia. He notes an improvement in mood, clearer thinking, increased enjoyment in activities, and a decrease in death thoughts. O: Patient B's PHQ-9 score decreased from 20 on June 7, 2017, to 8 on July 5, 2017, indicating significant improvement in depressive symptoms. He uses a Samsung Galaxy A5 running Android 6.0.1, and mobility data shows a low-mobility profile with no hour exceeding 1 km of travel.  A: Patient B demonstrates a positive response to sertraline treatment for dysthymia, with significant improvement in both cognitive and hedonic symptoms as evidenced by the decrease in PHQ-9 score and subjective reports. The lack of correlation between mobility patterns and clinical improvement suggests that the primary therapeutic effects are in cognitive and emotional domains. P: Continue current dose of sertraline 100 mg daily. Encourage Patient B to maintain medication adherence and monitor for any changes in symptoms. Schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to reassess depression status and adjust treatment as necessary. Consider incorporating activities to gently increase mobility as part of holistic health management, without focusing solely on mobility as a marker of improvement. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I have this swelling on the left side of my neck that has been increasing in size over the past 6 months. Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any other issues, such as pain or difficulty moving your neck? Patient: No, it's just the swelling. The other side of my neck and my upper limb are normal. Doctor: Alright. Do you have any existing health conditions? Patient: No, I don't have any co-morbidities. Doctor: Let's do a physical examination. I'm going to feel the swelling on your neck first.  (The doctor examines the patient) Doctor: I can feel a 10 × 12 cm globular, firm, non-pulsatile, and immobile swelling. I'm going to perform a Tinel's test to check for nerve irritation.  (The doctor performs Tinel's test) Doctor: Tinel's sign is negative on percussion. The swelling has smooth lobulated borders and goes down to the apex of your axilla. You don't seem to have any motor or sensory deficits. However, I notice that your brachial, radial, and ulnar artery pulses are absent. There's no locoregional lymphadenopathy or metastasis. Based on my examination, I would classify this as a stage 3 tumor (T3, N0, M0) according to the TNM classification. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What do we do next? Doctor: We'll need to perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to get a better understanding of the swelling. (After the MRI) Doctor: The MRI shows a well-encapsulated 7.4 cm × 9.2 cm × 13.6 cm, ovoid-shaped, heterogeneous lesion in the left interscalene and posterior triangle, the costoclavicular space, and retropectoralis minor space. There are hypointense areas on T2/short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) and hyperintense with isointense areas on T1 with fluid levels. We'll need to do an ultrasound-guided biopsy to determine the nature of the swelling. (After the biopsy) Doctor: The biopsy results show that the swelling is a synovial sarcoma. It tested positive for TLE1, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), CD56, and CD57, with weak positive S100 and SYT-SSX1 translocation in immunohistopathology. Patient: What does that mean for me, Doctor? Doctor: We discussed your case in a multidisciplinary team meeting with medical oncology. It was suggested that we attempt excision of the lesion, which may involve partial debulking surgery only due to the size of the tumor. After that, you will receive adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy to treat any remaining cancer cells and prevent recurrence. Patient: Alright, Doctor. What do I need to do to prepare for the surgery? Doctor: We'll schedule the surgery soon. In the meantime, please follow any preoperative instructions provided by the surgical team. We'll closely monitor your progress and work together to give you the best possible care. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient reports a progressively enlarging swelling on the left side of the neck over the past 6 months, with no associated pain or difficulty in neck movement. The patient denies any other systemic symptoms or existing health conditions. O: Physical examination revealed a 10 × 12 cm globular, firm, non-pulsatile, and immobile swelling on the left neck. Tinel's sign was negative. No motor or sensory deficits were noted, but brachial, radial, and ulnar artery pulses were absent. MRI findings showed a 7.4 cm × 9.2 cm × 13.6 cm ovoid-shaped, heterogeneous lesion in the left interscalene and posterior triangle, costoclavicular space, and retropectoralis minor space. Biopsy confirmed synovial sarcoma with positive TLE1, EMA, CD56, CD57, weak positive S100, and SYT-SSX1 translocation. A: The primary diagnosis is synovial sarcoma of the left neck, classified as T3, N0, M0. Differential diagnoses were considered but ruled out based on imaging and biopsy results. The prognosis depends on the response to surgical and adjuvant treatments. P: The management plan includes surgical excision of the tumor, potentially involving partial debulking due to the size of the tumor. Post-surgery, the patient will undergo adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Preoperative preparations and close monitoring by the surgical team are advised. A multidisciplinary team approach will be continued to ensure comprehensive care and follow-up. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, can you please remind me of the surgery you had for your sigmoid colon cancer? Patient: Oh, I had a sigmoidectomy. Doctor: Thank you. The pathological examination showed that you had a poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Your disease was classified as stage IIIb (fT3N2M0). Before the surgery, your CEA level was 0.8 ng/ml and there were no abnormalities in your preoperative laboratory analyses. After the surgery, you received chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid followed by tegafur uracil, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: At 46 months after the operation, your CEA level increased to 13.9 ng/ml. A positron emission tomography (PET)-CT showed an abnormal uptake in the upper lobe of your left lung. As a result, you had a left upper lobectomy. Do you remember the results of the pathological examination? Patient: Hmm, I think they found metastatic adenocarcinoma from the sigmoid colon cancer. Doctor: Correct. After the lobectomy, you were given oral adjuvant chemotherapy with tegafur uracil and calcium folinate. Your serum CEA level normalized after the surgery, but it increased to 23.3 ng/ml at 20 months after the lobectomy. The PET-CT then revealed a left adrenal metastasis. Do you recall the results of the CT and colonoscopy? Patient: There was no additional recurrence, I think. Doctor: That's correct. On admission, your general blood tests, including adrenal hormones levels, were normal. You then underwent a left adrenalectomy nearly 6 years after the first surgery. The histopathological findings confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of sigmoid colon cancer. Do you remember the chemotherapy treatment you received after the adrenalectomy? Patient: Yes, I had FOLFOX for 12 cycles. Doctor: Great. At the time of the most recent follow-up examination, which was 9 years after the last chemotherapy treatment following the resection of the adrenal metastasis, there was no recurrence detected by CT or colonoscopy, and your CEA level was normal. You've shown remarkable progress in your recovery. We'll continue to monitor you closely. Do you have any questions or concerns? Patient: No, I think you've explained everything clearly. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the future. Take care! [/INST] S: The patient is a survivor of sigmoid colon cancer, initially treated with sigmoidectomy for a poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma, stage IIIb (fT3N2M0). Post-sigmoidectomy, the patient underwent chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, and tegafur uracil. Subsequent developments included an increase in CEA levels and detection of metastases in the left lung and left adrenal gland, treated with left upper lobectomy and left adrenalectomy, respectively. The patient received additional chemotherapy regimens including tegafur uracil with calcium folinate post-lobectomy and FOLFOX post-adrenalectomy. The patient reports no current symptoms or concerns. O: Initial CEA level pre-sigmoidectomy was 0.8 ng/ml, increasing to 13.9 ng/ml at 46 months post-operation and 23.3 ng/ml at 20 months post-lobectomy. PET-CT scans detected metastatic sites in the left lung and left adrenal gland. Histopathological examinations confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma from the sigmoid colon at both sites. Recent follow-up, 9 years post-last chemotherapy, showed no recurrence with normal CEA levels and clear CT and colonoscopy results. A: The primary diagnosis is metastatic sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma, with a history of multiple metastases treated surgically and with chemotherapy. The patient is currently in remission with no evidence of disease recurrence. P: Continue regular monitoring with CT scans and colonoscopies to detect any potential recurrence. Maintain current follow-up schedule and encourage the patient to report any new symptoms immediately. Provide supportive care and monitor CEA levels as part of routine surveillance. Ensure the patient understands the importance of adherence to the follow-up schedule and maintains a healthy lifestyle to support overall well-being. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I saw in your notes that you presented with complaints of intermittent abdominal pain. Can you tell me more about this pain and how long you have been experiencing it? Patient: Yes, I've been having this chronic abdominal pain on and off for a while now. I'm not sure exactly how long, but it's been bothering me quite a bit. Doctor: I see. And do you have any history of alcohol consumption? Patient: Yeah, I've been drinking a moderate amount of alcohol for about 20 years. Doctor: Okay. Have you experienced any jaundice, fever, or weight loss recently? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. Doctor: That's good to know. We performed some laboratory tests on you, and the results showed no significant abnormal findings. Your serum amylase, lipase, and tumor markers like CA 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were all within normal limits. Patient: Oh, that's a relief. Doctor: We also did a CT examination on you, and we found a poorly defined soft tissue mass in your pancreaticoduodenal (PD) groove with a hypodense cystic lesion within the mass. The post-contrast study showed minimal enhancement in the portal venous phase, but the delayed imaging at 2-3 minutes showed mild persistent enhancement of the lesion compared with the pancreatic parenchyma, which is consistent with scar tissue. Patient: Hmm, I see. Doctor: The lesion also showed poorly defined fat planes with the adjacent second part of the duodenum on its right side and the pancreatic head on the left side. There was mild thickening of the wall of the second part of the duodenum adjacent to the lesion with variable luminal narrowing. Patient: Okay, so what does all that mean? Doctor: We wanted to get a clearer picture of the ductal system and the periampullary region, as well as the extension of the lesion, so we did an MRI examination too. The axial two-dimensional fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition sequences showed similar findings to the CT scan. Patient: Alright. Doctor: The MR cholangiopancreatography sequence revealed smooth and regular tapering of the pancreatic and common bile ducts. Your gallbladder was distended, and the cystic duct was normal. Patient: Okay, and what about those cysts you mentioned earlier? Doctor: Yes, incidentally, we found a few simple cysts (Bosniak 1) in both your kidneys. These are generally not a cause for concern. Patient: That's good to know. Doctor: Considering your condition, we advised surgical intervention as an option, but I understand you refused that. So, we will manage your condition with conservative treatment for now. Patient: Yes, I prefer to avoid surgery if possible. Doctor: We will monitor your condition closely and make adjustments to your treatment as necessary. It's important to keep us updated on any changes in your symptoms or if you have any concerns. Patient: I'll definitely do that. Thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient reports chronic, intermittent abdominal pain, duration unspecified. Denies recent jaundice, fever, or weight loss. Has a 20-year history of moderate alcohol consumption. O: Laboratory tests including serum amylase, lipase, CA 19-9, and CEA are within normal limits. CT and MRI imaging reveal a poorly defined soft tissue mass in the pancreaticoduodenal groove with a hypodense cystic lesion, minimal enhancement, and adjacent structural involvement. MRCP shows smooth tapering of the pancreatic and common bile ducts, distended gallbladder, and normal cystic duct. Incidental finding of simple renal cysts (Bosniak 1). A: The primary diagnosis is a pancreaticoduodenal groove mass with cystic features, likely benign given imaging characteristics and normal tumor markers. Differential diagnoses could include chronic pancreatitis or a neoplastic process. The renal cysts are incidental and typically benign. P: Opted for conservative management due to patient's refusal of surgical intervention. Plan to closely monitor the condition with follow-up imaging and labs, adjusting treatment as necessary. Patient education on symptom monitoring and prompt reporting of changes. Alcohol consumption counseling and potential referral to a hepatologist or gastroenterologist if complications arise or symptoms worsen. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you were diagnosed with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (T2N0M0) at the Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Kyushu Hospital, in November 2016. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Were you treated for pulmonary TB when you were 18? Patient: Yes, I was. Doctor: Okay, so during your examination, thoracic computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) showed no thoracic abnormalities, right? Patient: Yes, that's what they said. Doctor: You underwent radiotherapy for laryngeal cancer at 70 Gy (35 fr), and the tumor disappeared. However, in April 2017, a primary lesion recurrence with laryngeal edema and cervical lymph node metastasis were observed. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, unfortunately. Doctor: While waiting for surgery, you were administered steroid (prednisolone) for 1 month, with the dose starting at 60 mg and being reduced gradually, with the aim of alleviating the edema. Is that right? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: In May 2017, you had a total laryngectomy and bilateral cervical lymph node dissection. How was your recovery after the surgery? Patient: It was a bit rough. I developed a fever and had some trouble breathing. Doctor: I see that a thoracic X-ray 2 weeks before surgery in May 2017 revealed a small amount of pleural effusion. The amount of pleural effusion increased immediately after surgery, and by the following day, you had developed a fever of 39 °C. They initially considered your condition to be pleural effusion associated with pneumonia due to general bacteria, and sulbactam/ampicillin and meropenem were administered, but your symptoms didn't improve. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: Pleural fluid analysis showed that lymphocytes were present, which decreased the concern for bacterial infection. They then considered the possibility of TB, so sputum smear tests, including rapid molecular diagnostic testing for TB using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were conducted five times. However, the results were negative. Is that right? Patient: Yes, they couldn't find anything in those tests. Doctor: Eventually, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected in a solid medium (""Ogawa"" medium) culture test after 3 weeks. You were considered to have TB pleural effusion, and TB treatment was initiated. How has your treatment been going since then? Patient: It's been going alright. I've been taking the anti-TB drugs they prescribed. Doctor: Great, so you've continued to receive treatment with anti-TB drugs, which are rifampicin (RFP), isoniazid (INH), and ethambutol (EB). It's important that you continue to take these medications as prescribed and inform me of any changes in your symptoms or side effects you may experience. We will monitor your progress closely and adjust the treatment as needed. Do you have any questions or concerns about your treatment? Patient: No, I think I understand everything. Thank you for explaining it all to me. Doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help and support you throughout your treatment. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Take care and stay in touch. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, previously diagnosed with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (T2N0M0) in November 2016, underwent radiotherapy resulting in initial tumor resolution. However, a recurrence with laryngeal edema and cervical lymph node metastasis was noted in April 2017. Post-total laryngectomy and bilateral cervical lymph node dissection in May 2017, the patient experienced fever and breathing difficulties. The patient has a history of pulmonary TB treated in adolescence. Recently, the patient developed pleural effusion and fever post-surgery, initially treated as bacterial pneumonia without improvement. Subsequent tests confirmed TB pleural effusion, and TB treatment was initiated. O: Thoracic CT and PET scans showed no thoracic abnormalities initially. Post-surgery, X-rays revealed increasing pleural effusion. Pleural fluid analysis indicated lymphocytic predominance, reducing the likelihood of bacterial infection. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was eventually identified in a solid medium culture after 3 weeks. Current medications include rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol for TB. A: The primary diagnosis is TB pleural effusion secondary to a history of pulmonary TB and recent surgical intervention. Differential diagnosis initially included bacterial pneumonia. The prognosis depends on the response to ongoing anti-TB therapy and monitoring for any recurrence of laryngeal cancer. P: Continue current anti-TB medications (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol) as prescribed. Monitor for side effects and effectiveness of the treatment, with regular follow-ups to assess progress and potential complications. Educate the patient on the importance of adherence to the medication regimen and prompt reporting of any new symptoms or side effects. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist if there are changes in symptoms or if treatment response is suboptimal. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you are a 19-year-old male with some health concerns. Can you tell me about your birth and family history? Patient: Yeah, I was born after a normal pregnancy at 40 weeks, and my birth measurements were normal too. I weighed 4150 kg, was 52 cm long, and had a cranial circumference of 36 cm. My parents are both Caucasians and not related, and I have a healthy 18-year-old brother. Doctor: Alright, thank you for sharing that information. Now, I'd like to inquire about any symptoms you experienced when you were younger. Did you have any issues with vision, movement, or coordination? Patient: Yes, when I was 7 months old, I had nystagmus, convergent strabismus, and mild lower spasticity. Those were the first symptoms of the disease. Doctor: I see. And did you experience any developmental issues, such as loss of motor skills or regression? Patient: Yeah, I had a psychomotor regression. At 14 months, I lost the ability to walk alone and had ataxic signs. Then at 16 months, I developed chorea of the arms and dystonia of the trunk. Doctor: I understand. It appears that you underwent an MRI at some point that showed the typical pattern of Leigh Syndrome. There were hyperintense signals in the basal ganglia and thalami, and periventricular white matter. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Additionally, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) showed a lactate peak at 1.33 ppm. Were you aware of this? Patient: Yeah, I remember something about that. Doctor: In terms of your metabolic pattern, you had increased levels of plasma lactate, alanine, and valine, and reduced levels of citrulline. There was also an increase in 3 methylglutaconic acid in your urinary organic acids. Is this correct? Patient: Yes, that's what the tests showed. Doctor: Your Electroencephalogram (EEG) did not show any epileptic discharges, and you had a muscle biopsy at 18 months that revealed a mild myopathic process with non-specific abnormalities of oxidative reactions. Respiratory chain activities showed a slight reduction of complexes II and III. Are you aware of these findings? Patient: Yeah, I remember the doctor mentioning that. Doctor: At 26 months, you presented with dyskinetic tetraparesis associated with hyposthenia of the trunk and limbs. Did you have any cardiac, endocrine, gastrointestinal, or renal involvement? Patient: No, I didn't have any issues with those. Doctor: I see that the Griffiths scale was used to examine your cognitive profile, and it showed a moderate intellectual disability. How has your condition been since then? Patient: It was stable up until I was 9 years old. Then I started having drug-resistant generalized tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures. My spastic tetraparesis got worse, and I experienced neurological changes like dysarthria, dysphagia, loss of eye contact, and axial and limb dystonia. Doctor: I understand. It's important to continue monitoring your symptoms and working with your healthcare team to manage your condition. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or need assistance in the future. [/INST] S: 19-year-old male presents with a history of Leigh Syndrome diagnosed in early childhood.

Experienced psychomotor regression at 14 months with loss of walking ability, ataxic signs, and subsequent development of chorea and dystonia. Describes a stable condition until age 9, followed by drug-resistant generalized tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures, worsening spastic tetraparesis, and neurological changes including dysarthria, dysphagia, loss of eye contact, and axial and limb dystonia. O: Past MRI revealed typical Leigh Syndrome patterns with hyperintense signals in basal ganglia and thalami, periventricular white matter. 1H MRS showed a lactate peak at 1.33 ppm. Lab tests indicated increased plasma lactate, alanine, valine, decreased citrulline, and increased urinary 3 methylglutaconic acid. EEG showed no epileptic discharges. Muscle biopsy at 18 months indicated a mild myopathic process with slight reduction in complexes II and III of respiratory chain activities. Griffiths scale indicated moderate intellectual disability. A: Primary diagnosis of Leigh Syndrome with associated complications including psychomotor regression, movement disorders (chorea, dystonia), and drug-resistant epilepsy. Differential diagnosis should consider other mitochondrial disorders, but clinical presentation and investigations strongly support Leigh Syndrome. P: Continue current management plan focusing on symptomatic treatment of seizures and motor symptoms. Regular follow-up with neurology for seizure management and with physical therapy to address motor dysfunction. Genetic counseling for family planning given hereditary nature of Leigh Syndrome. Patient education on disease progression and management to ensure compliance and adjustment of care plan as needed. No new referrals indicated at this time. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 62-year-old lady with a history of diabetes type 2, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and a stroke. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've had this erythematous nodule on my right cheek for about 2 months, and I'm a bit concerned. Doctor: I see. Is this lesion single and occasionally painful? Patient: Yes, that's right. It has increased in size gradually over time and then became stable. Doctor: Alright. Let me perform a physical examination. Hmm, I see a 1 by 0.5 cm translucent nodule over your right cheek. We should take a punch biopsy to better understand this lesion. Patient: Okay, doctor. (After biopsy results) Doctor: The biopsy results show that the nodule is a nonencapsulated dermal lesion with spindle cells having scant cytoplasm, arranged in a vague storiform pattern. It's mixed with inflammatory cells, including foam cells and lymphocytes. The cells reach focally to the subcutaneous tissue and fat, but there's no evidence of tissue destruction.  Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: There are no mitotic figures, cellular atypia, or necrosis, which are good signs. The immunohistochemistry shows the expression of factor XIII and CD68, while other immunostains, including pan cytokeratin, CD20, CD34, ALK, CD30, S100, and HMB45, are negative.  Patient: So, what's the diagnosis? Doctor: These findings confirm that you have a benign fibrous histiocytoma, also known as a dermatofibroma. It's not any of the more concerning conditions like basal cell carcinoma, amelanotic melanoma, keratoacanthoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, or sebaceous adenoma. Patient: Oh, that's a relief! What should we do next? Doctor: Given your comorbidities, the management plan would typically involve excision of the lesion. However, your family has suggested we don't go further at this point due to your other health conditions. We'll respect their decision and monitor the situation closely. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and a previous stroke. She presents with a chief complaint of an erythematous nodule on her right cheek, which has been present for about 2 months. The lesion is described as single, occasionally painful, and has increased in size before stabilizing. O: Physical examination revealed a 1 by 0.5 cm translucent nodule on the right cheek. A punch biopsy was performed, and histopathological analysis showed a nonencapsulated dermal lesion with spindle cells in a storiform pattern, mixed inflammatory cells, and no evidence of tissue destruction. Immunohistochemistry was positive for factor XIII and CD68, with negative results for pan cytokeratin, CD20, CD34, ALK, CD30, S100, and HMB45.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 64-year-old African American female with a history of metastatic poorly differentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the right thigh and hypertension. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been feeling really tired and weak for the past 10 days, ever since my last chemotherapy session with adriamycin, ifosfamide, and mensa. I'm also having trouble walking and moving my arms fully. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently, such as polyuria or polydipsia? Patient: Yes, I've been urinating a lot and feeling very thirsty. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. I'd also like to review your systems. Have you had any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fevers, chills, night sweats, reduction in appetite, or weight loss? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those. Doctor: That's good to know. I see in your oncologic history that you've received neoadjuvant radiation therapy to the right thigh, followed by surgical resection. Unfortunately, you were later diagnosed with metastatic lesions in the lungs and treated with six cycles of palliative chemotherapy, including adriamycin, ifosfamide, and mesna. Your total cumulative dose of ifosfamide was 45 g/m2. You also experienced severe neutropenia, requiring a 25% dose reduction during the second cycle of therapy. After the third cycle, imaging studies showed disease stabilization. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: I also see that your weekly laboratory studies prior to your presentation here showed normal sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, creatinine, and phosphorus levels. Upon initial evaluation, you were hemodynamically stable; your electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm and chest X-ray showed no pathologic cardiopulmonary process. However, laboratory studies revealed a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury. Some notably abnormal lab values include 152 mmol/L of sodium, 1.3 mmol/L of potassium, 16 mmol/L of bicarbonate, 1.1 mg/dL of phosphorus, 1.8 mg/dL of magnesium, and 3.3 mg/dL of creatinine. Your blood glucose level was 123 mg/dL. Urinalysis also demonstrated some abnormalities.  Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does it all mean? Doctor: Your lab results suggest that the chemotherapy treatment may be affecting your kidney function and causing the fatigue and weakness you've been experiencing. We will need to closely monitor your kidney function and adjust your treatment plan as necessary to prevent further damage. Patient: What should I do now, doctor? Doctor: We will continue to monitor your lab values and symptoms closely. It's important for you to report any new or worsening symptoms immediately. We may need to adjust your chemotherapy regimen or consider other treatment options to help manage your condition and minimize the impact on your kidneys. Patient: I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. Let's stay in close communication, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. Take care.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today? Patient: I am a fit 89-year-old woman, but I have a history of chronic back pain and had an appendectomy when I was young. I've been experiencing pain in my right flank since yesterday. Doctor: I see. Do you have any fever, chills, or other symptoms? Patient: No, I don't have any fever or chills. Doctor: When you were admitted, you were not in distress, and your vital signs were within normal values. Upon clinical examination, we found swelling and tenderness around your appendectomy scar, measuring 12 cm × 4 cm, with a red area. We also felt crepitus on your right and left flanks, as well as the periumbilical and epigastric regions upon palpation.  Patient: Oh, that sounds concerning. Doctor: We ran some blood tests and found mild inflammation with a CRP value of 7 mg/l, which is within normal values, and an elevated white blood cell count of 18 G/l. The rest of the laboratory results were normal. We also performed an emergency ultrasonography, but it was unhelpful due to air interference. Patient: So, what did you find out? Doctor: We proceeded with an abdominal CT scan, which showed diffuse subcutaneous abdominal emphysema extending to the pelvis on the left side. It was more pronounced on the right inguinal fossa with a bowel loop in contact with the abdominal wall. Patient: Oh, no. What does that mean? Doctor: We conducted an emergency laparotomy centered on the McBurney incision from your appendectomy. We found feces and pus within the subcutaneous compartment, and an inflammatory diverticulum fistulizing between the lumen of the sigmoid colon loop and the necrotic subcutaneous tissue. Based on these findings, we diagnosed a subcutaneous abscess and emphysema caused by a ruptured sigmoid diverticulum in an incisional hernia. Patient: That sounds serious. What did you do? Doctor: We removed the necrotic tissues and closed the punctiform sigmoid colon fistula. We also revised the rest of the sigmoid, which showed important adhesions between the sigmoid colon and the parietal peritoneum of the right flank, and between the caecum and the sigmoid colon. Additionally, we found diffused diverticulosis without inflammation in the sigmoid colon. Patient: How did you treat that? Doctor: We left the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues open and dressed the wound with a negative pressure dressing to help with healing. Patient: Thank you, doctor. What should I do for follow-up care? Doctor: We'll monitor your progress closely and provide further instructions as needed. Make sure to follow up with us regularly, and let us know if you experience any new symptoms or concerns.

Clinical examination revealed swelling and tenderness around the appendectomy scar, measuring 12 cm × 4 cm, with associated redness and crepitus in the right and left flanks, periumbilical, and epigastric regions. Blood tests indicated mild inflammation with a CRP of 7 mg/l and an elevated WBC count of 18 G/l. Emergency ultrasonography was inconclusive due to air interference. A subsequent abdominal CT scan showed diffuse subcutaneous abdominal emphysema extending to the pelvis, more pronounced on the right inguinal fossa with a bowel loop in contact with the abdominal wall. An emergency laparotomy revealed feces and pus within the subcutaneous compartment and a fistulizing inflammatory diverticulum between the sigmoid colon loop and the necrotic subcutaneous tissue. A: The primary diagnosis is a subcutaneous abscess and emphysema secondary to a ruptured sigmoid diverticulum in an incisional hernia. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of abdominal pain and swelling such as other forms of hernia or post-surgical complications. The prognosis depends on the patient's response to the surgical intervention and management of the underlying diverticulosis.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi doctor, I've suffered from severe pain in my left leg for the past 3 months. The pain is mainly in the dorsally till my fifth toe. I also have low back pain. Doctor: I see. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain, how would you rate your low back pain and your leg pain? Patient: My low back pain is around 3-4, but my leg pain is really bad, like an 8. Doctor: Have you tried any treatments for your pain, such as injections or physiotherapy? Patient: Yes, I've had periradicular injections and physiotherapy, but they didn't help. Doctor: I understand. Let's do a physical examination. Can you please lie down and lift your left leg straight up? Patient: Okay. Doctor: Hmm, it seems that you have a positive straight leg test at 20°. I also noticed the absence of your Achilles tendon reflex and weakness of foot extension (M3-4). We'll need to do an MRI of your lumbar spine to get a clearer picture of what's going on. (After MRI is done) Doctor: The MRI results show that you have a large highly caudally migrated disc herniation in your left side. The sequester is inside the canal sacral, causing left side S1 compression. You'll need surgery to correct this issue. Patient: Oh, I see. What can I expect after the surgery? Doctor: After the surgery, you should experience rapid recovery. Your leg pain should be reduced to around 2 on the VAS scale the next day, and your straight leg test should be negative. Patient: That's good to hear. What about the weakness in my foot? Doctor: Your weakness should improve to M4 after surgery, and you should completely recover after 6 weeks. Patient: That's a relief. Will there be any follow-up imaging? Doctor: Yes, we'll do a postoperative MRI to ensure proper decompression. The MRI may show a very small rest disc piece inside the canal sacral, but that's normal. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'm looking forward to getting better. [/INST] S: The patient reports severe pain in the left leg, rated 8/10, persisting for 3 months, localized dorsally extending to the fifth toe, accompanied by low back pain rated 3-4/10. Previous treatments including periradicular injections and physiotherapy were ineffective. O: Physical examination revealed a positive straight leg test at 20°, absent Achilles tendon reflex, and foot extension weakness (M3-4). MRI of the lumbar spine indicated a large, caudally migrated disc herniation on the left side, with sequester inside the canal sacral causing left side S1 nerve compression. A: The primary diagnosis is a large left-sided lumbar disc herniation with S1 nerve root compression. Differential diagnoses were considered but ruled out based on imaging and clinical findings. The prognosis post-surgery is favorable with expected rapid improvement in symptoms. P: The patient is scheduled for surgical decompression to address the disc herniation. Post-surgery, the patient is expected to experience significant pain relief and improvement in motor function, with a recovery timeline of approximately 6 weeks for complete resolution of symptoms. Follow-up will include a postoperative MRI to confirm decompression and monitor for any residual disc material. Education on post-surgical care and physical therapy will be provided to aid recovery. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, sir. I understand you've been experiencing multiple melenic bowel movements. Have you also been feeling lethargic and easily fatigued? Patient: Yes, doctor. I've been feeling really tired and weak lately. Doctor: I see. I also noticed in your history that you have been treated for symptomatic anaemia for the past two years. During the clinical examination, you appeared pale, tachycardic, but normotensive. Your abdominal examination was unremarkable, but the digital rectal examination revealed melena. We found that your haemoglobin has dropped from 11 g/dl to 4 g/dl. Patient: Oh, that's quite a drop. Doctor: Yes, it is. We promptly resuscitated you with blood products and performed an early upper endoscopy. The oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGDS) showed a small Forrest 3 antral ulcer with multiple subcentimeter gastric polyps. We biopsied the gastric polyps, and the histopathology revealed them to be benign. Patient: That's a relief. Doctor: We also performed a colonoscopy, which showed blood-stained colonic mucosa, but no bleeding source was identified. An urgent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen revealed no significant abnormality and no bowel-related masses. Patient: So, what's causing the bleeding then? Doctor: After the acute gastrointestinal bleeding episode subsided, we worked on a presumptive diagnosis of a possible small intestinal bleed. We performed a capsule endoscopy, which showed several small telangiectasias in the proximal part of the small bowel. There was no visible tumour, polyps, or ulcers. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: We then performed a double-balloon enteroscopy, which showed abnormal vascularity with a central umbilication over the mucosa of the small bowel. The mucosal abnormality was located at 165 cm from the incisor. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It means that there is an issue with the blood vessels in your small bowel. We assessed your overall health with an ASA score of 1 and a Revised Cardiac Risk Index score of 1, which indicated that you were in good condition for surgery. Patient: So, what's next? Doctor: We performed a laparoscopic examination using a closed technique with a Veress needle. Intraoperative findings revealed an exophytic lesion measuring 6 cm. We will discuss the best course of action to address this lesion and manage your condition. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your thorough explanation and care. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your progress and keep you informed of any further findings or necessary treatments. [/INST] S: The patient reports multiple melena bowel movements, lethargy, and easy fatigue. He has a history of symptomatic anemia treated over the past two years.

Lab results indicated a significant drop in hemoglobin from 11 g/dl to 4 g/dl. OGDS identified a small Forrest 3 antral ulcer and benign gastric polyps. Colonoscopy showed blood-stained colonic mucosa without a bleeding source. CECT of the abdomen was normal. Capsule endoscopy and double-balloon enteroscopy revealed small bowel telangiectasias and an exophytic lesion at 165 cm from the incisor, respectively. Intraoperative findings during laparoscopy confirmed the presence of a 6 cm exophytic lesion. A: The primary diagnosis is gastrointestinal bleeding likely due to small bowel telangiectasias and an exophytic lesion in the small bowel. Differential diagnoses initially included gastric and colonic sources, but these were ruled out through diagnostic procedures. P: The patient was resuscitated with blood products and underwent diagnostic procedures including OGDS, colonoscopy, capsule endoscopy, and double-balloon enteroscopy. A laparoscopic examination was performed, and ongoing management will focus on addressing the exophytic lesion. Further surgical intervention may be considered based on the lesion's characteristics and patient's overall health status. Regular monitoring and follow-up are planned to assess treatment efficacy and progression. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Good afternoon, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi doctor, I'm feeling very uncomfortable lately and I have a background of lymphoblastic leukemia, allogeneic bone marrow transplant, and cervical cancer. Doctor: I see. When did you start feeling this discomfort? Patient: It started five days ago. I've been experiencing shooting cephalea, night sweats, asthenia, adynamia, dyspnoea, and a fever of 39°C, mostly at night. I also had some transvaginal bleeding, which is why I decided to seek treatment. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. It's important for us to understand your symptoms. When you were admitted to the National Medical Centre 20 of November-ISSSTE, did you notice any other issues? Patient: Yeah, I saw haematomas in my arms and legs. Doctor: Upon admission, we conducted some tests. Your leukocyte count was 1,800 cells per cubic millimeter, with 4.5% neutrophils. Your hemoglobin levels were at 8.5 g/dL, haematocrit at 24.5%, and platelet count at 11,000 cells/mm3. Due to these results, you were given a blood transfusion. However, you presented additional complications unrelated to the infection. Patient: Oh, that's concerning. What happened? Doctor: You had a fever of 39°C and fatigue, along with sweating for 3 days. We couldn't identify any specific focus of infection. Nevertheless, we treated you with imipenem (500 mg IV/6 h) and ciprofloxacin (500 mg/8 h) for 16 days. Unfortunately, there was no improvement. Patient: I see. So, what did you do next? Doctor: We performed a chest X-ray to check for the presence of a pneumonic focus or injuries, but we didn't detect any signs of infection. Patient: And the fever still persisted? Doctor: Yes, the fever of 39°C persisted. We then took 20 mL of venous blood from a central venous catheter and inoculated it into two aerobic blood culture bottles. A gram-negative bacterium was isolated from the central catheter, but the automated Vitek 2® system couldn't identify it. Patient: So, what did you do about the unidentified bacterium? Doctor: We decided to give you a new treatment, consisting of amikacin (1 g/24 h for 15 days) and ceftazidime (2 g IV/8 h for 15 days). Our hope is that this treatment will help you improve and recover. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything, doctor. I hope this new treatment works for me. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your progress and adjust the treatment as needed. If you notice any changes in your symptoms or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Take care. [/INST] S: Patient reports feeling uncomfortable for the past five days, with symptoms including shooting headaches, night sweats, asthenia, adynamia, dyspnea, and a fever of 39°C, mostly at night. The patient also experienced transvaginal bleeding and noticed hematomas on arms and legs. Medical history includes lymphoblastic leukemia, allogeneic bone marrow transplant, and cervical cancer. O: On admission, vital signs showed a fever of 39°C. Lab results indicated leukopenia with a leukocyte count of 1,800 cells/mm3, neutropenia with 4.5% neutrophils, anemia with hemoglobin at 8.5 g/dL and hematocrit at 24.5%, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 11,000 cells/mm3. Blood transfusion was administered. Chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonic focus or injuries. Blood cultures from a central venous catheter isolated a gram-negative bacterium, unidentified by the Vitek 2® system. A: The primary diagnosis is a suspected central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) with an unidentified gram-negative bacterium, in the context of severe pancytopenia and history of multiple malignancies. Differential diagnoses could include a relapse of underlying malignancies or other opportunistic infections. P: Initiated treatment with amikacin (1 g/24 h for 15 days) and ceftazidime (2 g IV/8 h for 15 days) targeting the unidentified gram-negative bacterium. Continue monitoring the patient's response to the new antibiotic regimen and adjust as necessary based on clinical response and further microbiological findings. Regular follow-ups to assess symptom progression and potential side effects of the treatment. Educate the patient on signs of infection and when to seek immediate care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I presented with a one-year history of exophthalmia in my left eye, and I don't have any nasal symptoms. There was no trauma or systemic disease. Doctor: I see. Have you had any surgeries or treatments related to this issue? Patient: Yes, I was operated on 6 months ago under a rhinoscopic approach. They did a marsupialization of the cyst, and the pathological examination showed characteristics of an aneurysmal cyst. Doctor: Alright. And have you noticed any changes or recurrences since then? Patient: Yes, actually, I was admitted for recidivism of the same lesion. Doctor: Hmm, okay. Let's do a clinical examination. Are you experiencing any loss of visual acuity in your left eye? Patient: No, my vision seems fine. Doctor: Good. Let's do a rhinoscopy to check your nasal area. *Performs rhinoscopy* I found a well-defined mass, sitting at the level of your left ethmoidal sinus. It looks smooth and pink. The other side appears normal. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It's an abnormal growth in your sinus. We'll need to do a tomodensitometry to get a better look at it. *Performs tomodensitometry* The scan shows an oval multiloculated lesion in your ethmoidal cells, measuring 39×23×35mm. Its content has multiple stalls with a liquid level realized by blood. It pushes your eye and right internal muscles without signs of invasion, causing grade I exophthalmia. It also fills your nasal fossa and pushes the septum without a free interface. It displaces the ethmoidal roof inward without endocranial invasion and is responsible for fluid retention in your left maxillary sinus. Additionally, it narrows your optical channel through posterior ethmoid cells invasion. Your frontal and sphenoidal sinuses are unaffected. Patient: That sounds concerning. What's the next step? Doctor: We'll need to perform a surgical intervention to remove the tumor. We'll do a total excision of the tumor, along with the orbital medial wall and its periorbital, using an endoscopic approach. We'll use an ENT navigation system to determine the skull base, orbit, and carotid canal, as landmarks may be modified by the tumor. Patient: Okay, I understand. Doctor: After the surgery, we'll send the removed tissue for histopathology. The previous examination found fusocelular carcinomatous proliferation in the herring bone with calcification, and the presence of multinucleated giant cells. We'll need to analyze the new sample to ensure complete removal and assess any additional treatment options. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll work together to address this issue and ensure your well-being. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. [/INST] S: The patient reports a one-year history of exophthalmia in the left eye without nasal symptoms or systemic disease. The patient underwent a marsupialization of a cyst via a rhinoscopic approach six months ago, which was identified as an aneurysmal bone cyst on pathology. The patient was recently admitted for recurrence of the lesion but reports no loss of visual acuity. O: Clinical examination and rhinoscopy revealed a well-defined, smooth, pink mass at the level of the left ethmoidal sinus. Tomodensitometry showed an oval multiloculated lesion (39×23×35mm) in the ethmoidal cells with blood levels, causing grade I exophthalmia, displacement of the ethmoidal roof, and narrowing of the optical channel. The lesion displaces the internal muscles and septum without signs of invasion. Frontal and sphenoidal sinuses appear unaffected. A: The primary diagnosis is recurrent aneurysmal bone cyst in the left ethmoidal sinus, with differential diagnoses including other benign or malignant sinus tumors. The lesion's characteristics and recurrence post-surgery suggest aggressive behavior but no endocranial invasion. P: Plan to perform a surgical excision of the tumor using an endoscopic approach, including removal of the orbital medial wall and periorbital. Utilize an ENT navigation system for accurate landmark identification. Post-surgery, send tissue for histopathology to confirm complete removal and check for signs of malignancy. Discuss further treatment options based on histopathology results. Educate the patient about the procedure and post-operative care, ensuring understanding and compliance. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you are a 61-year-old Arab man who retired from teaching 2 years ago. Do you smoke tobacco or consume alcohol? Patient: No, I don't smoke or drink alcohol. Doctor: Can you tell me about your past medical history? Have you had any surgical operations? Patient: Yes, I had a hydatid cyst of the liver removed 6 years ago in a surgery department, and a right ureteral lithiasis operated on at your urology department 4 years ago. I was only explored by an intravenous pyelogram at that time. Doctor: I see. Are you currently on any medications? Patient: Yes, I've been taking an alpha blocker for benign prostatic hyperplasia for the past 6 months. Doctor: Okay. You were admitted for a suspicious renal cyst that was incidentally found on a renal and vesicoprostatic ultrasound. Have you had any complaints or symptoms related to this? Patient: No, I have had no complaints or symptoms. Doctor: Good to know. Your physical examination was unremarkable. Your temperature was 37.2 °C, blood pressure 134/82 mmHg, and pulse rate regular at 74 beats per minute. Your laboratory values were also within normal range, including white blood cell count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, sodium, potassium, and C-reactive protein 1. Your urine examination showed no leukocyturia or bacteriuria. Patient: Oh, that's great to hear. Doctor: Yes, it is. However, the renal and vesicoprostatic ultrasound found a non-vascularized cystic formation with a thickened and irregular wall on your left kidney. We need to investigate this further. Patient: Okay, what's the next step? Doctor: We performed an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan which revealed a 38 mm left renal mid-pole lesion, isodense to the renal parenchyma. The dynamic CT showed an early intense and peripheral enhancement and a nonenhanced central zone, even in the delayed phase (Fig.). The renal artery and vein appeared normal, and no metastases were demonstrated. Patient: Is that a good sign? Doctor: It's a positive sign that there are no metastases. We also recovered a CT from 6 years ago that showed the same lesion, but it was 10 mm smaller. To further characterize the cyst, we conducted a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Patient: What did the MRI show? Doctor: The MRI revealed a lesion with a thickened and irregular wall. We need to closely monitor this cyst and follow up with additional tests and imaging to ensure proper treatment and management. Patient: Alright, thank you for keeping me informed. What are the follow-up requirements? Doctor: We will schedule regular check-ups and imaging tests to monitor the cyst. If there are any changes or growth, we will discuss the appropriate treatment options. It's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and continue taking your prescribed medications. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello there, I understand you had a right middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke 6 years ago. How has your recovery been since then? Patient: Hi, Doctor. Yeah, I've been managing alright. I have some residual left spastic hemiplegia, but I can walk without any assistive device at a moderate speed. Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any issues with your walking or posture? Patient: Hmm, yes. I've been told I have a mild circumductory gait, and my left side seems to be a bit stiff. My left hip keeps hiking up when I walk, and I tend to lean to the left side. Doctor: That's quite common with spastic hemiplegia. It seems like your spastic latissimus dorsi muscle could be responsible for these abnormal postures during walking. This includes pelvic vertical elevation in the coronal plane, trunk lateral flexion, shoulder adduction, and internal rotation. Patient: Oh, I see. What can be done to help with that? Doctor: We can try injecting onabotulinumtoxin A into the spastic muscle. This should help improve your trunk lateral flexion and pelvic elevation. The injection would be done under ultrasound imaging guidance to ensure precision. Patient: Okay, that sounds good. What kind of improvement can I expect? Doctor: After the injection, we would expect to see an improvement in your posture and walking. In a previous case, the patient's pelvic vertical elevation decreased from 19 degrees to 9 degrees after the injection. Patient: Wow, that's quite a difference. How long would it take to see the improvement? Doctor: You should start noticing the improvement around 6 weeks after the injection. Patient: Alright, I'm willing to give it a try. What do I need to do to prepare for the injection? Doctor: There's not much you need to do. Just make sure you follow any instructions given by the medical staff, and we'll take care of the rest. Patient: Great, thank you, Doctor. I'm looking forward to seeing the improvements in my walking and posture. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to help you achieve those improvements. Please let us know if you have any concerns or questions along the way. [/INST] S: The patient reports residual left spastic hemiplegia following a right middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke 6 years ago. He experiences a mild circumductory gait, stiffness on the left side, pelvic elevation, and trunk lateral flexion. The patient can walk without assistive devices at a moderate speed. O: The patient's abnormal gait and posture are attributed to spasticity in the latissimus dorsi muscle, affecting shoulder adduction and internal rotation. The proposed treatment involves onabotulinumtoxin A injection under ultrasound guidance. A: The primary diagnosis is post-stroke spastic hemiplegia with associated gait abnormalities. The differential diagnosis includes other causes of abnormal gait post-stroke, but these are less likely given the specific muscle involvement and history. P: Plan to administer onabotulinumtoxin A injection to the spastic latissimus dorsi muscle to improve trunk lateral flexion and pelvic elevation. Expected improvements in posture and gait should be noticeable around 6 weeks post-injection. The patient is advised to follow pre-procedure instructions provided by medical staff. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor progress and adjust treatment as necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I understand you're a 12-year-old girl who has been admitted to the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes for evaluation of your brachydactyly and right fibular fracture. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Okay, let's start with some background information. You were born after a full-term pregnancy and had a normal delivery with an Apgar score of 10. You're the only child in a non-consanguineous Chinese family, correct? Patient: Yes, that's true. Doctor: It seems that no prenatal investigation was performed, and your motor development was normal. Upon birth, you had stubby fingers and toes, with obvious shortening of the fourth metatarsal, but no hyperdactylia, syndactylism, intellectual impairment, or multiple exostoses were noticed. Your pubertal development was also normal, right? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: I see that you experienced a minor fall 1 month ago and were diagnosed with a fracture of the upper fibula in your right lower limb. You were treated with internal fixation and fibula bone grafting in the Department of Pediatric Orthopedics. How has your recovery been? Patient: It's been going well, thank you. Doctor: Great. Now, upon admission, we conducted a clinical examination, and I'd like to discuss some findings with you. Your standing height is 144 cm, with an upper portion of 72 cm, a lower portion of 72 cm, and an arm span of 131.3 cm. Is there anything you'd like to ask about these measurements? Patient: No, I understand. Doctor: During the clinical examination, we also noticed sparse scalp hair, a high-bossed forehead, thick eyebrows with lateral rarefaction, a characteristic bulbous pear-shaped nose, a long philtrum, a thin upper lip, a pointed chin, and large, protruding ears. Have you noticed any of these features before? Patient: Yes, I have. Doctor: In addition, the examination of your extremities showed brachydactyly with significant shortening of the fourth metatarsal, flat feet, thin nails, and koilonychias. Are you familiar with these terms, or would you like me to explain them further? Patient: No, I understand. Doctor: All right. We also performed radiography of both your hands, which showed brachydactyly and cone-shaped epiphyses of the middle phalanges of the digits of both hands, with deviation of the phalangeal. Based on these findings, we will continue to evaluate the cause of your brachydactyly and monitor your recovery from the fibular fracture. We'll also discuss any necessary follow-up appointments or treatments. Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any concerns or questions, please feel free to ask. We're here to help you. Patient: Thank you, I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: A 12-year-old girl presented to the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes for evaluation of brachydactyly and a recent right fibular fracture following a minor fall. The patient reports a normal motor and pubertal development, with no intellectual impairments or multiple exostoses. She has noticed features such as sparse scalp hair, a high-bossed forehead, and other distinct facial and extremity characteristics. She confirms understanding the medical terms used to describe her condition. O: The patient was born full-term with an Apgar score of 10. Clinical examination revealed a height of 144 cm, with proportional upper and lower body segments and an arm span of 131.3 cm. Features noted include sparse scalp hair, a bulbous pear-shaped nose, a long philtrum, and large protruding ears. Extremity examination showed brachydactyly, particularly significant shortening of the fourth metatarsal, flat feet, thin nails, and koilonychias. Radiography of the hands indicated brachydactyly with cone-shaped epiphyses of the middle phalanges and deviation of the phalangeal. The patient had undergone internal fixation and fibula bone grafting for the fibular fracture, with a reported good recovery. A: The primary diagnosis is brachydactyly, with ongoing evaluation to determine the underlying cause. The right fibular fracture is secondary to a minor trauma and is currently in the recovery phase post-surgical intervention. Differential diagnoses may include genetic syndromes associated with brachydactyly, which need to be ruled out through further genetic testing and consultation. P: The management plan includes continued monitoring of the fibular fracture recovery and further evaluation of the brachydactyly. Genetic consultation is recommended to explore potential underlying syndromes. The patient will be scheduled for follow-up appointments in both endocrinology and pediatric orthopedics. Education regarding her condition will be provided to ensure understanding and compliance with treatment recommendations. Further radiographic assessments and possibly genetic testing will be arranged during follow-up visits. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see here that you have a 13-year history of coronary heart disease and a 7-year history of hypertension. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been feeling really dizzy lately and my walking has been unsteady for about a week now. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, the dizziness and difficulty in walking started suddenly, and they get worse when I get up from the bed or sofa. Doctor: Alright, let's check your vitals. On admission, your blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg and your heart rate is 66 beats/min. Now, let's proceed with a neurological examination. *Performs examination* I noticed nystagmus on horizontal gaze. However, your pupillary reflexes and extraocular movements are intact. There's no limb weakness or sensory deficits, and your bilateral finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tests are normal. Additionally, bilateral Babinski signs are absent. The Romberg sign is impossible to evaluate as you're unable to cooperate with further examination. Patient: Hmm, so what does all that mean? Doctor: These findings are helpful, but we need some more tests to get a clearer picture. *After performing laboratory tests* Your laboratory tests are within normal limits. We've also done a brain MRI, which showed two areas of restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the left hemisphere. However, there was no acute infarction in the posterior cerebral artery territories. Patient: What does that mean for me, doc? Doctor: Since the location of the infarction area doesn't well explain your symptoms, we performed a digital subtraction angiography (DSA). It revealed that your left ICA was occluded. Interestingly, the left middle cerebral artery and bilateral anterior cerebral artery were supplied by the basilar artery via a PTA. Patient: So, what does this all mean? Doctor: We believe that in the setting of acute left ICA occlusion, a cerebral blood flow steal phenomenon occurred from the posterior circulation to the anterior circulation. This may have caused your acute onset of dizziness and difficulty in walking. The PTA might also play a protective role in preventing you from having a severe anterior circulation ischemic stroke. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: Furthermore, we did a CT perfusion, which showed no remarkable difference between the two hemispheres. This is consistent with our conclusion. As for treatment, we have started you on 100 mg... Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, with a 13-year history of coronary heart disease and a 7-year history of hypertension, presents with sudden onset dizziness and unsteady gait worsening upon standing, persisting for about a week. O: Vital signs on admission show blood pressure at 135/85 mmHg and heart rate at 66 beats/min. Neurological examination reveals nystagmus on horizontal gaze, intact pupillary reflexes, extraocular movements, and no limb weakness or sensory deficits. Bilateral finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tests are normal, and bilateral Babinski signs are absent. Laboratory tests are within normal limits. Brain MRI indicates two areas of restricted diffusion in the left hemisphere on DWI, with no acute infarction in the posterior cerebral artery territories. Digital subtraction angiography shows occlusion of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) and collateral circulation via the basilar artery to the left middle cerebral artery and bilateral anterior cerebral arteries through a persistent trigeminal artery (PTA). CT perfusion shows no significant perfusion difference between hemispheres. A: The primary diagnosis is acute left ICA occlusion with a cerebral blood flow steal phenomenon from the posterior to the anterior circulation, likely causing the patient's symptoms. The presence of a PTA appears to mitigate the severity of potential anterior circulation ischemic stroke. Differential diagnosis includes other causes of vertigo and unsteady gait, but these are less likely given the imaging findings and vascular pathology. P: Initiate treatment with 100 mg of the appropriate medication (not specified in the transcript). Continue monitoring vital signs and neurological status closely. Educate the patient on the signs of stroke and the importance of adhering to treatment and follow-up appointments. Schedule follow-up visits to reassess the patient's condition and adjust treatment as necessary. Consider consultation with a vascular surgeon or a neurologist for further management of the ICA occlusion and to evaluate the need for possible surgical intervention or further medical management. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I understand you've been experiencing some abdominal pain and discomfort for the past two weeks. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've been having abdominal pain, especially on the right side, along with jaundice, nausea, anorexia, and some episodes of loose stools. Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that. We'll need to do a physical examination and some laboratory tests to figure out what's going on. Let's start with the physical examination. Patient: Sure. Doctor: (After examination) I noticed some tenderness on your right side during the examination. Your lab results show slightly higher bilirubin levels at 0.4 mg/dL, but your serum amylase, lipase levels, and complete blood count are all within the normal range. We'll need to do an abdominal computed tomography to get a better understanding of your condition. Patient: Okay, let's do it. Doctor: (After CT scan) The computed tomography demonstrated a large cystic mass in the head of your pancreas, measuring 8.1 × 7.5 × 7.4 cm. There's also dilatation of the common bile duct, measuring 22 mm in diameter, and dilatation of the pancreatic duct, measuring 5 mm in diameter. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Let's not jump to conclusions yet. We need to perform a fine needle aspiration (FNA) using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) to gather more information. Patient: Alright. Doctor: (After EUS FNA) The fluid test from the EUS FNA showed a CEA level > 900 ng/mL, but the fluid cytology was negative for malignancy or high-grade dysplasia. We then performed an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with biliary stent placement, which resolved your jaundice. Patient: That's a relief. Doctor: Given these findings, we decided to perform an extended pylorus-sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy to remove the cystic mass. The operation was uneventful, and you'll be discharged 4 days after surgery. Patient: I'm glad the surgery went well. Doctor: We conducted a gross examination of the removed mass lesion, which measured 8.2 × 7.9 × 7.2 cm and was a unilocular cystic lesion containing gray-green turbid fluid with granular material. The cyst structure appeared to communicate with both the main and side duct branches. Paraffin-embedded sections of formalin-fixed tissue were studied by routine histology at the Indiana University Pathology Laboratory. Patient: What did the microscopic examination show? Doctor: The microscopic examination revealed that the tumor had two components, an epithelial component and a spindle cell. It's important to continue monitoring your health and follow up with your healthcare provider for any concerns. Patient: I understand. Thank you for taking care of me, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing abdominal pain predominantly on the right side, jaundice, nausea, anorexia, and episodes of loose stools for the past two weeks. O: Physical examination revealed right-sided abdominal tenderness. Laboratory tests showed elevated bilirubin levels at 0.4 mg/dL (normal range: 0.1-1.2 mg/dL). Serum amylase, lipase, and complete blood count were within normal limits. Abdominal CT scan identified a large cystic mass in the head of the pancreas (8.1 × 7.5 × 7.4 cm), with dilatation of the common bile duct (22 mm) and pancreatic duct (5 mm). EUS FNA fluid test indicated a CEA level > 900 ng/mL, but cytology was negative for malignancy. ERCP with biliary stent placement was performed, resolving the jaundice. Post-operative findings from the extended pylorus-sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy showed a unilocular cystic lesion, with histology revealing an epithelial component and a spindle cell. A: The primary diagnosis is a cystic pancreatic tumor, specifically a cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. Differential diagnoses considered included pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis, but these were less likely given the imaging and histological findings. P: The patient underwent successful extended pylorus-sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy to remove the cystic mass. Post-operative care included monitoring and management of potential complications such as infection or pancreatic leakage. The patient is advised to follow up regularly for monitoring of pancreatic function and to detect any recurrence of the disease. Further genetic counseling and testing may be considered to evaluate for hereditary cancer syndromes given the nature of the pancreatic lesion. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I had a minor automobile accident a while back, and since then I've been experiencing intermittent back pain. It feels sore and stiff, and it's about a 3 out of 10 on the pain scale. Doctor: I see. Does anything make the pain worse or better? Patient: Yeah, the pain is exacerbated by prolonged sitting, standing, and forward bending. I haven't found any relieving factors yet. Doctor: Alright. Have you undergone any treatment for this? Patient: Yes, I tried therapy and even had an MRI scan six weeks after the accident. Doctor: What did the MRI scan show? Patient: It showed a herniated L3-4 disc on the left side, and the report said that my L2 was normal. Doctor: Have you experienced any other symptoms? Patient: I started feeling left leg pain in the posterior thigh and calf, as well as tingling in the left leg. Doctor: Since you haven't had symptomatic relief, I'm going to refer you to a neurosurgeon. They will perform a thorough neurologic examination, including checking your sphincter function, reflexes, sensory, and motor function. Patient: Okay, thank you. [After the neurosurgeon's appointment] Doctor: I've reviewed the neurosurgeon's findings. They noticed a possible intradural lesion at L2 on your original MRI scan and ordered a stat MRI with gadolinium contrast. Patient: What did it reveal? Doctor: The MRI showed a smooth, strongly homogeneously enhancing mass of 14 x 21 x 13 mm in the central and right intradural space behind the L2 vertebral body. It seems your symptoms are from the disc herniation, and the intradural tumor is incidental. Patient: So what's the next step? Doctor: You underwent a transforaminal microdiscectomy at L3-4 for the herniated L3-4 disc, which resulted in complete resolution of your back and left leg pain and tingling. As for the tumor, you were given the option of open laminotomy and tumor resection or stereotactic radiosurgery. Patient: What did I choose? Doctor: You elected for continued observation of the tumor with follow-up MRI scans and were programmed for stereotactic radiosurgery. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us. Take care! [/INST] S: The patient reports intermittent back pain rated 3/10 on the pain scale, exacerbated by prolonged sitting, standing, and forward bending, following a minor automobile accident. The pain is accompanied by left leg pain in the posterior thigh and calf, and tingling in the left leg. No relieving factors have been identified. O: Initial MRI revealed a herniated disc at L3-4 on the left side, with normal L2. Follow-up MRI with gadolinium contrast identified a 14 x 21 x 13 mm homogeneously enhancing mass in the central and right intradural space at L2. The patient underwent a transforaminal microdiscectomy at L3-4, which resolved the back and leg symptoms. A: Primary diagnosis is a herniated disc at L3-4, successfully treated with microdiscectomy. An incidental finding of an intradural tumor at L2 is under observation. Differential diagnosis included other causes of radiculopathy or spinal lesions, which were ruled out by imaging and surgical intervention. P: The patient elected for observation of the intradural tumor with scheduled follow-up MRI scans and potential future stereotactic radiosurgery. The patient is advised to monitor symptoms and report any changes. Regular follow-ups with neurosurgery are recommended to assess the tumor's status and decide on further interventions if necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, it's nice to see you for your follow-up appointment. How have you been feeling since completing your antibiotic therapy for the Brucella suis infection in your right knee? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I was feeling completely fine after the treatment, but yesterday I started experiencing worsening right knee pain, warmth, and overlying redness. It's been quite uncomfortable. Doctor: I see. It's important that we address this issue. Just to confirm, you were afebrile and feeling systemically well prior to this issue, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: As reported before, you had an original total arthroplasty of your right knee 12 years ago, and in 2015, you were diagnosed with a B. suis PJI after multiple synovial fluid aspirates grew the organism. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: You underwent irrigation and debridement with removal of all prosthetic components and implantation of a gentamicin, vancomycin, and ceftazidime impregnated static cement spacer. You completed 10 days of intravenous aminoglycoside therapy, initially with tobramycin and then gentamicin, combined with oral doxycycline and rifampin. Oral antibiotics were continued for a total of 12 weeks. How were you feeling after this treatment? Patient: I felt much better. My knee pain improved, I had no fever, and my inflammatory markers normalized. My surgical wound also healed nicely. Doctor: That's good to hear. Now, regarding your past medical history, you have obesity, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and osteoarthritis with chronic back pain, correct? And you're currently taking hydrochlorothiazide, ramipril, and pantoprazole? Patient: Yes, that's all correct. Doctor: Do you have any known allergies? Patient: No, I don't have any allergies. Doctor: I understand you live on a remote island in the Canadian Arctic and work as an artist. You regularly butcher wild meat and often consume it raw, correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Now, let's move on to your physical examination. Your right knee appears swollen and erythematous. Since you have a static cement spacer, you're not able to perform range of motion. There's no apparent drainage or visible sinus tracts on the right knee. The remainder of your physical examination is unremarkable. We'll need to take radiographs of your right knee to further assess the situation. Patient: Okay, Doctor. Thank you for your help. Doctor: You're welcome. After we review the radiographs, we'll discuss the next steps in your treatment. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Patient: Thank you, I appreciate your support. [/INST] S: The patient reports worsening right knee pain, warmth, and redness starting yesterday, following a history of Brucella suis infection treated with antibiotics. The patient was feeling well post-treatment until the recent onset of symptoms. The patient has a history of total arthroplasty in the right knee 12 years ago, with a subsequent diagnosis of B. suis prosthetic joint infection (PJI) treated with irrigation, debridement, and antibiotics. The patient has no known allergies and reports no fever or systemic symptoms currently. O: Physical examination shows swelling and erythema of the right knee with a static cement spacer in place, limiting range of motion. No drainage or sinus tracts are visible. The patient's past medical history includes obesity, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and osteoarthritis with chronic back pain. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, ramipril, and pantoprazole. Radiographs of the right knee are pending. A: The primary concern is a potential recurrence of B. suis PJI or a new infection in the right knee, given the patient's symptoms and history. Differential diagnoses include inflammatory arthritis or mechanical issues related to the static spacer. The prognosis depends on the findings of the upcoming radiographs and possible need for further surgical intervention. P: Plan to review radiographs of the right knee to assess for signs of infection or mechanical failure. Based on the radiographic findings, consider further synovial fluid analysis and cultures. Continue monitoring inflammatory markers and symptoms. Discuss the potential need for revision surgery or further antibiotic therapy depending on the results. Educate the patient on signs of infection and the importance of prompt reporting of any new symptoms. Ensure follow-up in the clinic after radiographic evaluation. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 37-year-old man without any prior comorbid conditions. Can you tell me what brought you to the secondary-care hospital today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I had this wide complex tachycardia for about two hours. I felt some chest discomfort and a thumping sensation, but no other symptoms. Doctor: I see. It looks like you were treated for VT in the emergency room. They gave you a single 1 mg/kg dose of lidocaine, which terminated the tachycardia. After that, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern was obtained and it was essentially within normal limits, with no suggestion of preexcitation or ischemia. Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: You were then referred to our center for further evaluation. We performed a normal ECG and checked your serial cardiac enzymes, which were also normal. Your coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries. The differential diagnosis included a VT arising from the anterolateral peri-mitral area and an aAVRT arising from an AP in the left free wall. To rule out an AP, we performed an electrophysiologic study (EPS). Patient: Okay. Doctor: After achieving femoral venous access, we placed two quadripolar catheters in the high right atrium (HRA) and right ventricle (RV). A decapolar catheter was placed in the coronary sinus (CS) from the femoral vein but couldn't be advanced distally enough to bracket the AP due to the CS anatomy. We positioned the ablation catheter at the His bundle region and carried out the EPS. Patient: Hmm, I see. Doctor: Baseline intervals were within normal limits. Retrograde conduction with ventricular pacing was concentric and decremental. Atrial pacing revealed preexcitation at 360-380 ms initially and 290-310 ms later; this occurred briefly during Wenckebach block in the atrioventricular node (AVN) with induction of tachycardia. Patient: Oh, alright. Doctor: The effective refractory periods (ERP) of anterograde AVN and APs were less than 220 ms. Tachycardia was induced during atrial and ventricular pacing by atrial and ventricular extrastimulation. The tachycardia cycle length (TCL) varied from 440 to 280 ms. Patient: So, what does all this mean for me, Doctor? Doctor: Based on these findings, we will continue to monitor your condition and recommend appropriate treatment options. It is important to follow up with us regularly to ensure your heart remains healthy. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll be sure to follow your advice and stay in touch. [/INST] S: The patient is a 37-year-old male with no prior comorbid conditions who presented with wide complex tachycardia lasting about two hours, accompanied by chest discomfort and a thumping sensation. He reports no other symptoms. O: Initial treatment in the emergency room with 1 mg/kg of lidocaine terminated the tachycardia. Subsequent 12-lead ECG was within normal limits. Serial cardiac enzymes and coronary angiogram were normal. Electrophysiologic study (EPS) showed normal baseline intervals, concentric and decremental retrograde conduction with ventricular pacing, and preexcitation during atrial pacing. Effective refractory periods (ERP) of anterograde AVN and APs were less than 220 ms. Tachycardia was induced with atrial and ventricular pacing. A: The primary diagnosis is ventricular tachycardia (VT) potentially arising from the anterolateral peri-mitral area. Differential diagnosis includes an accessory atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (aAVRT) arising from an accessory pathway (AP) in the left free wall. The absence of ischemia and normal coronary arteries are noted. P: The patient will continue to be monitored with regular follow-ups to assess heart health and manage the condition. Further treatment options may be considered based on ongoing evaluation. The patient is advised to maintain regular contact with the healthcare team to ensure timely management of any new or recurring symptoms. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see in your records that you were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus over 10 years ago. How have you been managing it so far? Patient: Hmm, yes, I've been taking glimepiride and metformin for a long time, but I recently ran out of the medicine before my scheduled appointment. Doctor: I noticed that your body weight is 41.7 kg with a BMI of 20.1 kg/m2. Your liver function, with an AST of 24 IU/mL, and renal function, with a creatinine of 0.68 mg/dL, seem to be normal. And it looks like you haven't had any diabetic complications so far, which is good. Patient: That's a relief to hear. Doctor: However, I must ask, have you been experiencing any cognitive decline recently? Patient: Yes, I've been a bit forgetful lately. Doctor: It seems like there might have been an overdose of glimepiride and metformin due to your cognitive decline, so we decided to discontinue those drugs. We prescribed you teneligliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which has a lower risk of hypoglycemia. How has that been working for you? Patient: Well, my blood sugar hasn't been great. I think it's gotten worse. Doctor: Yes, I see that your hemoglobin A1c levels increased to 10.2% within 6 months. Considering your situation, we decided to administer 2 mg of exenatide-LAR once weekly to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia caused by overdosing. Have you been coming in for your injections? Patient: Yes, I've been visiting the clinic weekly for the exenatide-LAR injections. Doctor: That's good to hear. Your HbA1c level rapidly decreased, and after 4 months, it reached 7.1%. Moreover, good blood glucose control was achieved. Patient: Oh, that's great news! Doctor: To make things easier for you, we extended the dose interval to 2 weeks and then to 1 month. When you were receiving exenatide-LAR every 2 weeks, your HbA1c level was in the 6% range. And for more than 2 years with once-monthly administration, it was in the 7% range. Fasting glucose just before the next injection did not rise, which is a positive sign. Patient: That's really helpful. I can manage the injections much more easily now. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. Unfortunately, it seems that outpatient treatment has become difficult for you recently. We'll need to discuss alternatives to ensure you continue receiving the care you need. Patient: Okay, I understand. Let's figure out what's best for me moving forward. [/INST] S: The patient, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus over 10 years ago, reports recent cognitive decline and forgetfulness. Previously managed with glimepiride and metformin, these were discontinued due to suspected overdose linked to cognitive issues. The patient expresses concerns about worsening blood sugar control despite switching to teneligliptin and subsequently to exenatide-LAR injections. O: Current weight is 41.7 kg with a BMI of 20.1 kg/m2. Liver function tests show AST at 24 IU/mL, and renal function tests show creatinine at 0.68 mg/dL, both within normal ranges. Recent hemoglobin A1c levels increased to 10.2% but improved to 7.1% after starting exenatide-LAR, which has been administered weekly, biweekly, and monthly with good control of fasting glucose levels. A: Primary diagnosis is type 2 diabetes mellitus, well-controlled currently with exenatide-LAR. The patient's cognitive decline is a concern, potentially affecting diabetes management and medication adherence. No evidence of diabetic complications is noted at this time. P: Continue monitoring diabetes with exenatide-LAR injections, now administered monthly. Assess cognitive function to determine if it impacts self-management of diabetes or if alternative care settings are needed. Regular follow-ups to monitor hemoglobin A1c and fasting glucose levels are recommended. Consider referral to a neurologist for cognitive assessment and management. Educate the patient on recognizing symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Discuss outpatient treatment alternatives to ensure continued care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your medical history, especially any issues related to thrombocytopenia? Patient: Yeah, I've had thrombocytopenia since childhood. My mother, maternal aunt, brother, and son also have it. We don't know the genetic cause though.  Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that information. We found elevated levels in your blood tests. Your total protein is 10.3 g/dl, serum monoclonal spike is 3.5 g/dl, immunoglobulin G (IgG) is 5371 mg/dl, and free lambda light chains are 703 mg/dl with a free kappa/lambda ratio of 0.08.  Patient: Hmm, I see. What about my calcium and renal function? Doctor: Your calcium and renal function are within normal limits, which is good. Your hemoglobin level is 16.6 g/dL, and your platelet count is 33 × 103/μL. Patient: Oh, okay. Did the skeletal survey show anything? Doctor: The skeletal survey was negative for any lytic lesions, which is great news. Your bone marrow examination showed adequate megakaryocytes with normal platelet morphology, and no dysmegakaryopoiesis or micromegakaryocytes were seen on the bone marrow. Erythrocytes and granulocytes were also adequate in number without any significant abnormality. Patient: That's a relief. What about my past medical history? Doctor: Your past medical history includes essential hypertension and hypogonadism, but no neuropathy or dermatologic conditions.  Patient: Have there been any issues with my vision, hearing, or bleeding disorders? Doctor: No, there's no personal or family history of physical deformity, vision, hearing, or bleeding disorders. Your platelet count history ranged from 30 to 50 × 103/μL. Patient: What about my hemoglobin and hematocrit levels? Doctor: Your repeat testing of hemoglobin was 17.9 g/dl with a hematocrit of 55.6%. The peripheral blood examination showed normal appearing red and white blood cells, with erythrocytosis, and morphologically normal platelets that were decreased in number. Patient: Is my Erythropoietin level normal? Doctor: Yes, your Erythropoietin level is normal at 12.2 mIU/mL. Molecular testing found no mutations in JAK2 V617F or BCR/ABL1 (p190 and p210). Patient: So, why do I have erythrocytosis? Doctor: The erythrocytosis is attributed to the use of testosterone supplementation for your hypogonadism. Patient: I see. Did the congenital thrombocytopenia testing panel show anything? Doctor: We ordered a limited congenital thrombocytopenia testing panel, and it came back negative for mutations in myeloproliferative leukemia protein (MPL), runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), and myosin heavy chain. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything. What do I need to do for follow-up? Doctor: You should continue to monitor your health and have regular check-ups. We will keep an eye on your blood levels and manage any complications if they arise. It's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and follow your treatment plan for hypertension and hypogonadism. If you experience any new symptoms or worsening of your condition, please reach out to us immediately. [/INST] S: The patient reports a long-standing history of thrombocytopenia, which is familial, affecting multiple family members without a known genetic cause. He also has essential hypertension and hypogonadism but no history of neuropathy, dermatologic conditions, or bleeding disorders. He is currently on testosterone supplementation. O: Blood tests revealed total protein at 10.3 g/dl, serum monoclonal spike at 3.5 g/dl, IgG at 5371 mg/dl, and free lambda light chains at 703 mg/dl with a kappa/lambda ratio of 0.08. Hemoglobin is 16.6 g/dL, and platelet count is 33 × 10^3/μL. Calcium and renal function are normal. Skeletal survey showed no lytic lesions.

Molecular testing negative for JAK2 V617F and BCR/ABL1 mutations. Congenital thrombocytopenia panel negative for mutations in MPL, RUNX1, and myosin heavy chain. A: The patient has chronic familial thrombocytopenia with a current exacerbation. The erythrocytosis is likely secondary to testosterone therapy for hypogonadism. No evidence of a myeloproliferative disorder or significant bone marrow pathology was found. P: Continue monitoring blood levels and manage hypertension and hypogonadism as per current guidelines. Maintain regular follow-ups to monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment as necessary. Encourage a healthy lifestyle and immediate reporting of any new or worsening symptoms. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, how can I help you today? Patient: I've been having some pain in my left clavicle while I was out walking my dog. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me if you have any history of medical issues? Patient: Yes, in 2003 I was diagnosed with grade I, node negative, triple receptor negative ACC of the left breast. I was treated with a mastectomy. Doctor: I understand. And have you had any other issues since then? Patient: Yes, eight years later I was diagnosed with a new tumour in my right breast. It was a grade III, 3/17 node positive, ER positive/HER2 negative invasive ductal carcinoma. I was treated with another mastectomy, axillary node clearance, chemoradiotherapy, and letrozole (Femara, Novartis). Doctor: It seems like you've been through quite a lot. Have you experienced any issues since your last treatment? Patient: Well, I had been disease free up until my latest presentation in 2016. Doctor: And this clavicular pain you mentioned, did it settle down at any point? Patient: It settled spontaneously at first, but then it came back, which is why I'm here now. Doctor: Thank you for the information. We conducted a clinical examination and found a mass involving your left clavicle, measuring 5 cm in transverse diameter. A radiograph showed evidence of an expansile destructive lesion at the medial end of the clavicle, along with soft tissue invasion which was confirmed on CT, bone scintigraphy, and PET-CT. Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Given the atypical nature of the lesion and your history of breast cancer, we performed a bone biopsy to get a clearer picture. Histology showed a tumour with a biphasic pattern of epithelial and myoepithelial cells forming cribriform and tubular structures containing eosinophilic secretions. There were no solid areas to indicate high grade disease and no perineural invasion was seen. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: Immunohistochemical staining was positive for keratin 7 but negative for ER/PR/HER2, keratin 20, gross cystic disease fluid protein-15, and thyroid transcription factor-1. We reviewed the histology from your original breast carcinoma and found a similar pattern. In the absence of an additional radiological primary site, the bone lesion was reported as primary metastatic ACC in keeping with your previously diagnosed left breast cancer. Patient: So, what happens now? Doctor: We recommend a multidisciplinary team discussion to decide the best course of action. In your case, you underwent surgical resection of the lesion and clavicle. Macroscopic examination showed an expansile tumour in the clavicle with probable extension. Patient: I see. What should I do for follow-up care? Doctor: We will continue to monitor your progress and provide any necessary follow-up treatments. It's essential to keep an open line of communication and report any new symptoms or concerns you may have. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all your help. [/INST] S: The patient, a female with a significant history of breast cancer, reports experiencing pain in her left clavicle while walking her dog. The pain initially settled spontaneously but recurred, prompting her visit. She has a past medical history of grade I, node-negative, triple receptor-negative adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the left breast treated with mastectomy in 2003, and a grade III, 3/17 node-positive, ER-positive/HER2-negative invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast treated with mastectomy, axillary node clearance, chemoradiotherapy, and letrozole in 2011. She was disease-free until 2016. O: Clinical examination revealed a 5 cm mass at the medial end of the left clavicle. Radiographic imaging showed an expansile destructive lesion with soft tissue invasion. Bone scintigraphy and PET-CT confirmed these findings. A bone biopsy indicated a biphasic pattern tumor consistent with metastatic ACC, similar to the patient's original left breast cancer. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for keratin 7 but negative for ER/PR/HER2, keratin 20, gross cystic disease fluid protein-15, and thyroid transcription factor-1. A: The primary diagnosis is metastatic ACC of the left clavicle, likely originating from the previously treated left breast ACC. The findings suggest a recurrence of the primary breast cancer rather than a new primary cancer. P: The patient underwent surgical resection of the clavicular lesion. A multidisciplinary team will discuss further treatment options. Follow-up care includes regular monitoring and immediate reporting of any new symptoms. The patient is advised to maintain open communication with her healthcare providers to manage her condition effectively. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that your six-month-old male infant has a significant past medical history, including neonatal meningitis on the second day of life. What brings you in today? Parent: Hi, Doctor. We've noticed that our baby's head has been enlarging disproportionately for the past three months. Doctor: I see. Let's start with an initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the situation. *After MRI* The results show gross asymmetrical hydrocephalus with obstruction at the level of the aqueduct, and no signs of ependymal thickening. Parent: What does that mean, Doctor? Doctor: It means there is an abnormal buildup of fluid in the brain, which can cause the head enlargement you've noticed. We performed a ventricular tap to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for cytology, biochemical analysis, and culture. The cultures were sterile, and there were no features of infection at that time. Parent: That's good news, right? Doctor: Yes, but to reduce the intra-cranial pressure, we placed an external ventricular drain (EVD) and started intraventricular vancomycin (10 mg 12 hourly) along with parenteral vancomycin (120 mg 8 hourly) and meropenem (240 mg 8 hourly). We continued monitoring the CSF. Parent: Hmm, okay. What happened next? Doctor: Four weeks later, your child developed a fever. We found that the EVD had blocked, and a repeat MRI scan showed gross asymmetric dilatation of the left lateral ventricle along with air-fluid level in the right periventricular region, suggestive of pneumocephalus. Parent: Oh no, what did you do then? Doctor: We managed it by performing a right temporoparietal craniotomy and excision of a multiloculated abscess. We also removed the right EVD and placed a left EVD. Parent: Were there any signs of infection this time? Doctor: Yes, the CSF samples showed features of infection, and we found Gram-positive budding yeast in a direct stain. Candida parapsilosis was isolated from the culture, and it was susceptible to all antifungals. We started fluconazole (50 mg 24 hourly) and continued monitoring the CSF. Parent: Did the treatment work? Doctor: Despite the treatment, daily CSF samples continued to grow C. parapsilosis through day 10. We then removed the EVD and placed an Ommaya reservoir along with a ventricular catheter for better intraventricular antibiotic administration, using vancomycin (10 mg 12 hourly). CSF samples taken 13 days and onwards were sterile, and your infant became afebrile and stable. Parent: That's a relief. What's the next step? Doctor: We continued antifungal therapy for three weeks. Your baby is now stable, and the infection has been cleared. We'll continue to monitor your child's progress and ensure that there are no further complications. Parent: Thank you, Doctor. We appreciate all the care and attention you've given to our baby. [/INST] S: The patient, a six-month-old male infant, presented with a chief complaint of progressive head enlargement over the past three months. The infant has a significant past medical history of neonatal meningitis. The parent reports no other symptoms at this time. O: Initial MRI revealed gross asymmetrical hydrocephalus with obstruction at the aqueduct level. A ventricular tap showed sterile cultures and no signs of infection. Subsequent MRI indicated a blocked external ventricular drain (EVD), gross asymmetric dilatation of the left lateral ventricle, and pneumocephalus. CSF samples later tested positive for Candida parapsilosis, susceptible to all antifungals. Current vital signs and other physical examination details are not provided. A: The primary diagnosis is post-infectious hydrocephalus complicated by recurrent ventriculitis due to Candida parapsilosis. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of hydrocephalus and central nervous system infections. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the resolution of infection and stabilization of the patient's condition. P: The management plan included the placement of an EVD followed by antibiotic and antifungal therapy (intraventricular vancomycin 10 mg 12 hourly, parenteral vancomycin 120 mg 8 hourly, meropenem 240 mg 8 hourly, and fluconazole 50 mg 24 hourly). After persistent infection, an Ommaya reservoir and ventricular catheter were placed for better management of intraventricular antibiotics. The patient will continue antifungal therapy for three weeks and undergo regular monitoring of CSF and clinical status to ensure no further complications. Further consultations with pediatric infectious disease specialists and neurosurgeons are recommended. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you have a history of fever of unknown origin for 3 weeks, accompanied by weight loss of 2.5 Kg. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've been having fever and sweating, mostly at night, and the fever goes as high as 40.3 C. I also have pain in my right knee. Doctor: I understand. I also noticed that you have a history of thalassemia with hemoglobin levels fluctuating between 95 and 100 g/L. Have you received any treatment for that? Patient: Yes, I had a blood transfusion and antibiotic treatment with Cefperazone-Sulbactam, Azithromycin, and Piperacillin-Sulbactam at a local hospital before coming here. Doctor: How has your fever been since then? Patient: The intermittent fever continued even after the treatment. Doctor: Okay, let's discuss the results of the physical examination and laboratory tests we conducted upon your admission to our pediatric department. The physical examinations were normal, except for diffuse enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes. The laboratory test showed a drop in white blood cell count (3.33*10^9/L, N, 26.7% L, 64.65) and hemoglobin levels (71 g/L). Additionally, there was an increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 25 mm/h) and ferroprotein (FER, 1669 ng/ml). We also observed a slight increase in ALT (105 U/L) and AST (145 U/L) levels and a significant increase in LDH (2082 U/L). Your serum level of high sensitive c-response protein (hsCRP) was normal (6.81 mg/L), and the level of procalcitonin (PCT) had a slight increase (0.16 ng/ml). Patient: Hmm, what does all that mean? Doctor: These results indicate that there might be an ongoing infection in your body. To further investigate, we obtained two sets of blood culture and two sets of bone marrow culture at the time of admission. Patient: And what were the results of those cultures? Doctor: Two bone marrow cultures presented positive results 2.6 days after being obtained, and one set of blood culture presented positive results 3.6 days after being obtained. The other set of blood culture remained negative after 5 days. Patient: So, what's the next step for my treatment? Doctor: Considering the positive cultures and your symptoms, we will continue to monitor your condition closely and adjust your treatment accordingly. We may modify your antibiotic treatment to target the specific infection and continue to manage your thalassemia as needed. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help you. [/INST] S: The patient reports a 3-week history of fever of unknown origin, peaking at 40.3 C, accompanied by night sweats and a 2.5 Kg weight loss. The patient also experiences pain in the right knee. Despite previous treatments including blood transfusions and antibiotics (Cefperazone-Sulbactam, Azithromycin, Piperacillin-Sulbactam), the fever has persisted. O: Physical examination shows diffuse enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes. Lab findings indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3.33*10^9/L, hemoglobin at 71 g/L, elevated ESR at 25 mm/h, ferroprotein at 1669 ng/ml, and liver enzymes (ALT 105 U/L, AST 145 U/L, LDH 2082 U/L). hsCRP is normal at 6.81 mg/L, and PCT slightly elevated at 0.16 ng/ml. Two bone marrow cultures and one blood culture returned positive, indicating an ongoing infection. A: The primary diagnosis is an ongoing infectious process, evidenced by persistent fever, positive cultures, and elevated inflammatory markers. Differential diagnoses could include infectious mononucleosis, tuberculosis, or a complicated bacterial infection secondary to thalassemia-related immunocompromise. The prognosis depends on the identification and responsiveness to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. P: The management plan will include close monitoring and adjustment of antibiotic therapy based on culture results and sensitivity patterns. Continued management of underlying thalassemia is necessary. Further consultations with infectious disease specialists and hematologists may be required. Patient education regarding signs of worsening symptoms and compliance with the treatment regimen is crucial. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you're a 67-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a history of long-term tobacco abuse. I see that you recently quit smoking. What brings you here today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having shortness of breath, cough, myalgias, and malaise for about a week now. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. I see you received two doses of the Pfizer COVID vaccine, with your second dose in February 2021. Let me check your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 120/71, heart rate 78 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation is 85% on room air. You are afebrile. We'll need to do some assessments to better understand your condition. Patient: Okay, Doctor. Doctor: We performed a laboratory assessment on admission and also took a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. Your test came back positive. Patient: Oh no, that's not good. Doctor: Yes, it's unfortunate. We also performed a chest X-ray on admission, which showed mildly patchy bibasilar pulmonary infiltrates and a calcified pulmonary nodule in the mid-right lung, measuring 2.0 cm. Based on these findings, we admitted you to the general medical ward. Patient: What's the treatment plan, Doctor? Doctor: We started you on 6 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, as well as medications including remdesivir, dexamethasone, furosemide, azithromycin, and enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Despite these measures, you haven't shown much improvement, so we need to consider more aggressive management. Patient: I see. What's the next step? Doctor: We performed a repeat chest X-ray, which showed slight interval improvement of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. You now need 4-5 L per minute of oxygen via nasal cannula. Patient: Hmm, alright. What should I expect going forward? Doctor: We'll continue to closely monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as needed. Our goal is to help you recover and manage your symptoms effectively. You may need to stay in the hospital for a while, but we'll do our best to get you back to better health. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.

Patient is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with Pfizer vaccine, last dose received in February 2021. O: Vital signs include blood pressure 120/71 mmHg, heart rate 78 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 85% on room air. Patient is afebrile. Laboratory tests confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Initial chest X-ray showed mildly patchy bibasilar pulmonary infiltrates and a calcified pulmonary nodule in the mid-right lung measuring 2.0 cm. Repeat chest X-ray indicated slight interval improvement of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Current oxygen requirement is 4-5 L/min via nasal cannula. A: Primary diagnosis of COVID-19 with respiratory involvement, complicated by underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Differential diagnosis includes exacerbation of COPD. The presence of a calcified pulmonary nodule suggests a potential chronic pathology, possibly benign given the calcification, but requires further evaluation. P: Continue supplemental oxygen at 4-5 L/min via nasal cannula and current medications including remdesivir, dexamethasone, furosemide, azithromycin, and enoxaparin. Monitor clinical and oxygenation status closely with adjustments in therapy as needed. Consider further imaging or biopsy of the pulmonary nodule if there is no improvement or if new symptoms suggest malignancy. Educate patient on COVID-19 management and the importance of monitoring symptoms. Discuss potential need for prolonged hospital stay depending on respiratory status and response to treatment. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, Patient A. I see you've presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and low-grade fevers. Can you tell me when you started experiencing these symptoms? Patient: Hmm, I've been having these pains and fevers for a few days now. Doctor: I understand you've had five intravesical BCG instillations for your non-muscle invasive urinary bladder papillary TCC. When was your last instillation? Patient: Yes, that's correct. My last instillation was about 6 months ago. Doctor: Your medical history also indicates that you have COPD, Type II diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and macular degeneration. There's also a history of remote TB exposure in your childhood, but no treatment or related hospital admissions. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's all accurate. Doctor: We've done a complete blood cell count, and everything is within normal limits. However, your C-reactive protein is elevated at 58.6 mg/L, which is above the normal range of 0–8.0 mg/L. This may indicate an infection or inflammation. Patient: Oh, okay. What does that mean for me? Doctor: We did some imaging when you presented, and it demonstrated a new, multi-septated, low-density collection within the retrocrural/posterior mediastinal region abutting the descending thoracic aorta. The size of this collection is 6.3 cm × 1.9 cm × 5.6 cm. We also identified an enhancing focal outpouching arising from the descending thoracic aorta on the right posterolateral wall. Patient: Hmm, what does that mean? Doctor: We conducted a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to further investigate. The lesion showed peripheral intense hypermetabolism with central photopenia. The PET/CT did not demonstrate any additional hypermetabolic lesions and was negative for tumor recurrence or metastatic disease elsewhere. We also performed an MRI of your thoracic spine, which was negative for discitis or osteomyelitis. Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: We performed a CT-guided aspiration of the retrocrural abscess, and the pathology results showed mycobacterium bovis, consistent with BCG. Based on these findings, we're going to treat you with Isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and Vitamin B6. Patient: Alright, what about that mycotic aneurysm you mentioned? Doctor: Given your medical comorbidities, we've decided to treat the mycotic aneurysm with endovascular stent graft placement rather than open surgical repair. We didn't find any post-procedural complications on the follow-up CT. Patient: That's good to hear. Is there anything else that needs to be done? Doctor: We also performed adjunctive percutaneous drainage of the periaortic collection. We'll continue to monitor your progress and adjust treatment as necessary. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: Patient A, a male with a history of non-muscle invasive urinary bladder papillary TCC treated with intravesical BCG, presents with abdominal pain and low-grade fevers persisting for a few days. He has a medical history of COPD, Type II diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, macular degeneration, and remote TB exposure. No previous treatment for TB or related hospital admissions. O: Vital signs are stable. Laboratory tests show normal complete blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein at 58.6 mg/L (normal 0–8.0 mg/L). Imaging revealed a new multi-septated, low-density collection in the retrocrural/posterior mediastinal region measuring 6.3 cm × 1.9 cm × 5.6 cm, and an enhancing focal outpouching from the descending thoracic aorta. PET/CT indicated peripheral intense hypermetabolism with central photopenia, negative for tumor recurrence or metastatic disease. MRI of thoracic spine was negative for discitis or osteomyelitis. CT-guided aspiration identified mycobacterium bovis. A: Diagnosis of BCG-related retrocrural abscess and mycotic aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta. Differential diagnoses considered included tumor recurrence and metastatic disease, which were ruled out by PET/CT. P: Initiated treatment with Isoniazid, Rifampin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol, and Vitamin B6 for BCG infection. Endovascular stent graft placement performed for the mycotic aneurysm, with no post-procedural complications noted. Adjunctive percutaneous drainage of the periaortic collection was also performed. Plan to monitor progress and adjust treatment as necessary, with follow-up imaging and lab tests to assess response to therapy and detect any complications. </s>"

Have you had any other symptoms, such as night sweats or changes in your weight? Patient: Yes, I've been having fevers almost every night, along with night sweats. My weight, however, has been stable. Doctor: What about any cough, sore throat, or rashes? Patient: I do have a persistent non-productive cough, but no sore throat or rashes. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Are you currently taking any medications? Patient: I'm only taking enalapril for my hypertension. Doctor: Have you seen a doctor about these symptoms before?  Patient: Yes, I saw my family doctor for the same symptoms 2 weeks ago. They did some routine investigations, but nothing came up. At that time, I also had left knee pain, which developed after a hike the previous month. They did X-rays of my knee and femur, but they were unremarkable. The pain resolved within a week, and no therapeutic interventions were needed. Doctor: Alright. Have you had any recent sick contacts, sexual partners, or insect/tick bites? Any exposure to tuberculosis or animals? Patient: No, I haven't had any sick contacts, sexual partners, or insect/tick bites. I also have no known exposure to tuberculosis or animals. I did travel to the Channel Islands 3 months ago, though. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Now, I am going to perform a physical examination.  *After the examination* Doctor: Based on the examination, you appear non-toxic. Your vital signs show a temperature of 38.6 °C, a heart rate of 96 beats/minute, blood pressure of 130/65 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. There are no rashes or lymphadenopathy present. Your thyroid appears normal, and there are no signs of hyperthyroidism. Your jugular venous pulse is 2 cm above the sternal angle, and your heart sounds are normal, with no extra sounds or murmurs.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I was diagnosed with left breast cancer and I'm considering my options for reconstruction. Doctor: I see. One option for reconstruction is bilateral autologous breast reconstruction. This involves using your own tissue to create new breasts. Have you heard of this procedure before? Patient: Yes, I've heard of it, but I'm not sure about the details. Doctor: Let me explain the procedure. Intraoperatively, we place the patient in lithotomy position, which means you'll be lying on your back with your legs elevated. We'll draw skin paddle fleur-de-PAP patterns on both thighs to indicate where the tissue will be taken from. The tissue is then elevated using incisions and dissection, and the dominant perforators, which are the blood vessels that supply the tissue, are identified. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: We'll then make additional incisions and harvest the flaps, which are the pieces of tissue we'll use for the reconstruction. These flaps will be anastomosed, or connected, to the internal mammary artery and vein in your chest. This ensures proper blood flow to the new breast tissue. Patient: So, how do you make sure the new tissue has enough blood supply? Doctor: We use a technique called fluorescence imaging to confirm that the perfusion, or blood flow, to the skin paddle is adequate. This is a critical step to ensure the success of the procedure. Patient: I see. And how much tissue would you use for the reconstruction? Doctor: The final flap weights for a typical procedure are around 316 grams for the right side and 298 grams for the left side, with each flap measuring approximately 22 cm by 7 cm. Patient: Alright, what happens after the surgery? Doctor: During your follow-up appointments, we'll monitor your recovery. In some cases, patients may experience minimal dehiscence, which is a small separation at the incision site. This can be treated with silver nitrate applications. Patient: And what about esthetic procedures? Doctor: Yes, once you've healed, you can undergo second-stage esthetic procedures for contouring. This may involve excising the skin paddle, fat grafting for volume in the superior pole, which is the upper part of the breast, and nipple tattooing. For example, we might add 140 mL of fat to the right breast and 80 mL to the left breast. Patient: Are there any complications with these esthetic procedures? Doctor: Generally, these procedures are well-tolerated and have minimal complications. Our goal is to help you achieve the most natural and satisfying results possible. Patient: Thank you for explaining everything. I'll think about it and discuss with my family. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to support you throughout this journey. [/INST] S: The patient reports being diagnosed with left breast cancer and is considering options for reconstruction. She has heard of bilateral autologous breast reconstruction but is unsure about the details. O: The doctor explained the procedure of bilateral autologous breast reconstruction, including the use of the patient's own tissue from the thighs, anastomosis to the internal mammary artery and vein, and the use of fluorescence imaging to ensure adequate perfusion. Mentioned typical flap weights are approximately 316 grams for the right side and 298 grams for the left side, each measuring about 22 cm by 7 cm. Follow-up involves monitoring for complications like minimal dehiscence, which can be treated with silver nitrate. A: Primary diagnosis is left breast cancer with a plan for bilateral autologous breast reconstruction. The assessment includes ensuring adequate blood supply to the reconstructed tissue and managing potential complications such as dehiscence. P: The plan includes proceeding with bilateral autologous breast reconstruction using tissue from the thighs. Post-operative follow-up to monitor healing and manage any complications. Discussion of second-stage esthetic procedures such as excising skin paddle, fat grafting, and nipple tattooing once healing is complete. The patient is advised to consider the information and discuss further with her family, with an open invitation to address additional questions or concerns. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 77-year-old obese Caucasian male who presented to the emergency department with sudden lower chest and epigastric pain and collapse after lifting a heavy object on your ranch. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. It was quite sudden and painful. Doctor: I understand you were previously quite active and lost 50 pounds in the past year through a diet and exercise regimen. Your past medical history also includes gastroesophageal reflux disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension. You were a former smoker from age 15 to 60, and you had a history of daily alcohol use, which ended in your mid-forties. Is that accurate? Patient: Yes, that's all correct. I've been trying to take better care of myself in recent years. Doctor: When you arrived at the emergency department, your initial vital signs showed a blood pressure of 94/72 mmHg, a heart rate of 89 bpm, a respiratory rate of 16 BPM, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. During the physical exam, you appeared somnolent but easily aroused, pale, and in severe distress. Do you recall that? Patient: Yeah, I remember feeling really out of it and in a lot of pain. Doctor: Your cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs. Your lungs were clear and without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. The abdominal exam showed a soft, distended, and moderately tender epigastric region, but no rebound or guarding. We didn't detect a pulsatile mass or any abdominal bruits.  Patient: Okay, that's good to know. Doctor: Your initial complete blood count demonstrated a white count of 24.0 ×109/L, hemoglobin of 11,000 grams per liter, platelet count of 198 ×109/L, with 93% neutrophils. The comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable, and your creatine phosphokinase, troponin, amylase, and lipase levels were all normal. Patient: I see. What does that mean? Doctor: It means there were no significant abnormalities in your blood tests, which is a good sign. Your electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a sinus rhythm with no acute ST changes and a right bundle branch block, which was also seen on a previous ECG. Patient: Oh, alright. Doctor: To further investigate, the patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest. We're currently waiting for the results, and we'll discuss them once they're available. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. [/INST] S: The patient is a 77-year-old obese Caucasian male who presented with sudden lower chest and epigastric pain following the lifting of a heavy object. He reports the pain was sudden and severe. His medical history includes gastroesophageal reflux disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, a history of smoking from age 15 to 60, and past daily alcohol use which ceased in his mid-forties. He has lost 50 pounds in the past year through diet and exercise. O: Upon presentation, vital signs were: blood pressure 94/72 mmHg, heart rate 89 bpm, respiratory rate 16 BPM, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. Physical examination showed the patient somnolent but easily aroused, pale, and in severe distress. Cardiovascular exam was normal with a regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, and clear lungs. The abdominal exam revealed a soft, distended, and moderately tender epigastric region without rebound or guarding. Initial labs showed a white blood cell count of 24.0 ×10^9/L, hemoglobin 11 g/L, platelet count 198 ×10^9/L, with 93% neutrophils. Comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable, and levels of creatine phosphokinase, troponin, amylase, and lipase were normal. ECG indicated sinus rhythm with no acute ST changes and a right bundle branch block, consistent with previous findings. A CT angiogram of the chest has been performed, results pending. A: The primary concern is acute abdominal pathology potentially related to the patient's sudden onset of pain post-exertion. Differential diagnoses include acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, and peptic ulcer disease. The normal enzyme levels and lack of acute changes on ECG make acute coronary syndrome less likely. The high white blood cell count may suggest an inflammatory or infectious process. P: Continue monitoring vital signs and pain. Await CT angiogram results to further guide diagnosis and treatment. Manage pain as appropriate and ensure fluid resuscitation given the low blood pressure. Prepare for possible urgent intervention depending on CT results. Educate the patient on the importance of avoiding heavy lifting and managing his chronic conditions. Follow up on the CT angiogram results and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Consider consultation with cardiology or gastroenterology based on the outcomes of the imaging studies. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi, I see that you're a 34-year-old male with hypertension. You were admitted to the hospital for the first time on Oct 16, 2015, due to an elevated SCr level for more than 12 months. Can you tell me about your symptoms back then? Patient: Yes, my SCr level was 1222 umol/L, and my BUN was 24.33 mmol/L. My blood pressure was really high too, at 180/100 mmHg. Doctor: That's correct. At that time, you were waiting for a renal transplantation. You were readmitted to the hospital on Jan 5, 2016, and then received a kidney allograft the next day. The procedure was performed with routine ZHIB, as shown in Fig. a. After the surgery, you were given standard triple immunosuppression and HD. How did you feel after the surgery? Patient: Hmm, I remember the follow-up assessments were done almost every day, but the course was not very favorable. Doctor: Yes, unfortunately, you experienced DGF emerging. An USG-guided renal graft biopsy was performed on post-op day 75, which documented acute TCMR (2015 Banff 2A) and extensive deposits of CaOx crystals in the interstitial tubule, as seen in Fig. b and c (200X HE and polarized light). Based on the absence of oxalate crystals in the ZHIB and your history of kidney stones, the recurrence of CaOx nephropathy following kidney transplantation was confirmed. This led to the diagnosis of PH. However, the diagnosis of PH must depend on genetic testing. Were you able to undergo the genetic testing? Patient: Unfortunately, no. I didn't have the molecular genetic testing to identify the PV in AGXT, GRHPR, or HOGA1 for some reasons. Doctor: I see. Although your renal function was slowly repairing (SCr 260 umol/L; BUN 14 mmol/L), the treatment with HD was not effective in treating excess oxalate, in addition to drug immunosuppression. Did you have any other symptoms at that time? Patient: Yes, I had a high fever of 39.8 °C and an intermittent cough. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. It's essential to closely monitor your renal function and follow up with your healthcare provider to manage your condition effectively. Do you have any questions? Patient: No, thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. [/INST] S: The 34-year-old male patient reports a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease, leading to renal transplantation. Initially admitted with a serum creatinine (SCr) level of 1222 umol/L and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 24.33 mmol/L, and high blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg. Post-transplant, he experienced delayed graft function (DGF) and symptoms including high fever of 39.8 °C and intermittent cough. He has not undergone genetic testing for primary hyperoxaluria (PH). O: Initial SCr was 1222 umol/L, BUN was 24.33 mmol/L, and blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg. Post-operative findings included acute T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR, 2015 Banff 2A) and extensive deposits of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals in the renal graft. Recent SCr and BUN levels were 260 umol/L and 14 mmol/L, respectively. The patient was on standard triple immunosuppression and hemodialysis (HD). A: The primary diagnosis is chronic kidney disease secondary to hypertension, complicated by DGF and acute TCMR post-transplant. The presence of CaOx crystals suggests recurrent CaOx nephropathy, potentially due to undiagnosed PH. Differential diagnosis includes other causes of nephropathy and rejection of the transplanted kidney. P: Continue monitoring renal function and manage hypertension. Maintain immunosuppressive therapy and HD. Recommend genetic testing for PH to confirm diagnosis and guide treatment. Address symptoms of fever and cough with appropriate investigations and symptomatic treatment. Educate the patient on the importance of follow-up for renal function and potential complications. Consider referral to a geneticist for evaluation of PH. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Good morning! I see that you're a 44-year-old pregnant nulliparous woman, carrying twins at 34 weeks of gestation, which was obtained through in vitro fertilization. Can you share with me the reason for your admission to the General Hospital of Massa? Patient: Good morning, Doctor. I've been experiencing spreading pricking and lower limb edema, and I decided to come in because it was becoming quite uncomfortable. Doctor: I understand. I also noticed in your medical history that you've suffered from unstable insulin-dependent type I diabetes and sciatica. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: During your stay, you had 4 days of immobilization in bed, and we administered low molecular weight heparin, specifically Dalteparin 2500 UI, once per day. Are you aware of this? Patient: Yes, I remember that. Doctor: You underwent a planned caesarean section under double-space CSE anaesthesia. We used a 25-gauge atraumatic spinal needle at level L3-L4 and an 18-gauge Thuoy needle at T12-L1 with a B. Braun Perifix® epidural set. It was all done in a single attempt. How are you feeling after the procedure? Patient: I'm feeling better now, thank you. Doctor: That's good to hear. Your preoperative coagulation parameters were within normal range. Your platelet count was 120,000 per microliter of blood, prothrombin time 12 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 30 seconds, fibrinogen 540 mg/dL, and INR 0.90. Your renal function was also normal. Are you experiencing any issues related to these? Patient: No, I haven't noticed any problems. Doctor: The operation was carried out routinely, and we started you on multimodal pain therapy. This includes Patient Controlled Epidural Anaesthesia (PCEA) with chirocaine 0.15% plus sufentanil 0.5 mcg/ml at 4 ml/h, i.v. ketorolac 30 mg/day, and oral tramadol 30 mg plus acetaminophen 1000 mg three times a day. How is your pain management? Patient: It's been working well for me, and my pain is under control. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. Four hours after the operation, we removed your urinary catheter, and you were able to stand up and take care of your newborns. We continued administering Dalteparin 2500 U/die. Do you have any concerns regarding this? Patient: No, I'm fine with that. Doctor: Good. We discontinued PCEA 2 days after the operation, and the epidural catheter was removed on the 3rd day, 12 hours after the last Dalteparin administration. Since then, how has your pain control been? Patient: It's been optimal, no issues at all. Doctor: That's great to hear. You've remained hospitalized without any complications, and your two babies have been admitted to neonatology. Overall, how are you feeling now? Patient: I'm feeling much better, and I'm happy that my babies are being taken care of. Doctor: That's wonderful. We'll continue to monitor your progress and ensure you and your babies get the best care possible. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate your help and support. [/INST] S: The patient is a 44-year-old nulliparous woman, pregnant with twins at 34 weeks gestation via in vitro fertilization, presenting with spreading pricking and lower limb edema. She reports discomfort due to these symptoms. She has a history of unstable insulin-dependent type I diabetes and sciatica. Post-operative, she feels better and reports effective pain management with the prescribed regimen. O: The patient underwent a caesarean section under double-space CSE anesthesia using a 25-gauge atraumatic spinal needle at L3-L4 and an 18-gauge Thuoy needle at T12-L1. Preoperative coagulation parameters and renal function were normal (platelet count 120,000/µL, PT 12 seconds, PTT 30 seconds, fibrinogen 540 mg/dL, INR 0.90). Post-operative pain management included PCEA with chirocaine 0.15% and sufentanil 0.5 mcg/ml at 4 ml/h, IV ketorolac 30 mg/day, and oral tramadol 30 mg plus acetaminophen 1000 mg three times a day. The patient was immobilized in bed for 4 days and received Dalteparin 2500 UI daily. The epidural catheter was removed on the third day post-operation, 12 hours after the last Dalteparin administration. A: The primary diagnosis is a post-operative state following caesarean section in a high-risk pregnancy due to age, twin pregnancy, and pre-existing conditions (type I diabetes and sciatica). The patient's symptoms of pricking and edema are likely related to pregnancy-induced changes and prolonged immobilization. No complications have been noted post-operatively, and pain management is effectively controlled. P: Continue monitoring the patient's recovery and diabetes management closely. Maintain the current pain management regimen as it is effective. Encourage gradual mobilization to prevent thromboembolic events. Follow up on renal function and coagulation parameters as needed. Provide diabetes-specific nutritional counseling and adjust insulin therapy as necessary. Schedule follow-up appointments in obstetrics and endocrinology to manage ongoing needs related to her twin pregnancy and diabetes. Educate the patient on signs of infection or complications to watch for and ensure she understands the medication regimen, especially as it pertains to pain management and anticoagulation therapy. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of Alopecia Universalis (AU) and moderately severe Atopic Dermatitis (AD) with an Investigator's Global Assessment score of 3. Can you please tell me about your symptoms and when they first started? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've had AD since childhood, but my AU started about 5 years ago. It's been getting worse over time. Doctor: I see. During your physical examination, we noticed multiple eczematous patches on your face, back, chest, and bilateral upper and lower extremities. We also observed patches of hair loss on your scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, face, chest, and extremities. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe would you rate your itch? Patient: It's been really bad, I'd say an 8. Doctor: Thank you for that information. The results of your skin biopsy from the scalp indicate that it's consistent with AU. I understand that you've been treated with intralesional steroids, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil for AU, but there was minimal improvement. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, doctor. Those treatments didn't help much with my AU or my AD. Doctor: I also see that you've tried topical steroids, H1 and H2 antihistamines, and phototherapy for your AD, but your condition remained refractory. Additionally, your AD didn't improve while receiving methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil for your AU. Given the lack of response to multiple systemic therapies, I'd like to start you on off-label tofacitinib at a dose of 5 mg orally, twice daily.  Patient: Okay, doctor. I'm willing to try this new treatment. How long will I be on it? Doctor: We'll begin with a 10-month course of treatment and closely monitor your progress.  Patient: Alright, I understand. What should I expect in terms of improvement? Doctor: After 10 months of treatment, we hope to see hair regrowth on all of the affected body parts and an improvement in your AD. Ideally, your itch severity should also decrease, aiming for a numerical rating scale itch score of 3 or lower. Patient: That sounds promising. Are there any adverse effects I should be aware of? Doctor: It's important to pay attention to any clinical symptoms and report them to us. We'll also be conducting regular laboratory tests to check for any abnormalities. So far, no adverse effects have been reported in similar cases. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and I'm hopeful about this new treatment. Doctor: You're welcome. Please keep me updated on your progress, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. [/INST] S: The patient reports a history of Alopecia Universalis (AU) that began approximately 5 years ago and has progressively worsened. The patient also has a long-standing history of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) since childhood, currently rated as moderately severe with an Investigator's Global Assessment score of 3. The patient rates the severity of itch as 8 out of 10. O: Physical examination revealed multiple eczematous patches on the face, back, chest, and bilateral upper and lower extremities. Patches of hair loss were observed on the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, face, chest, and extremities. Skin biopsy from the scalp is consistent with AU. Previous treatments including intralesional steroids, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, topical steroids, H1 and H2 antihistamines, and phototherapy have been minimally effective. A: The primary diagnosis is Alopecia Universalis with concurrent Atopic Dermatitis. Both conditions have shown minimal improvement with multiple systemic therapies, indicating a refractory nature. Differential diagnoses have been ruled out through clinical evaluation and biopsy. P: Initiate off-label treatment with tofacitinib at a dose of 5 mg orally, twice daily, for a 10-month course. Monitor the patient's progress closely, with regular laboratory tests to check for any abnormalities. Aim for hair regrowth and an improvement in AD symptoms, with a target itch severity score of 3 or lower. Educate the patient on potential adverse effects and ensure compliance with the treatment regimen. Regular follow-ups are scheduled to assess treatment efficacy and manage any emerging issues. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're an 86-year-old postmenopausal Mexican woman with no remarkable family history of cancer. You've been referred to me for a gynecologic consult. Can you tell me more about your personal history regarding your health? Patient: Yes, I have had a history of hypertension since I was 40 years old. I was also diagnosed with lobular cancer in my left breast 30 years ago. Doctor: I see. How was your breast cancer treated? Patient: I had a radical breast mastectomy along with unilateral axillary lymph node dissection. I also received adjuvant chemotherapy after the surgery, but I don't remember much about the details. Doctor: That's okay. The pathology report from your previous treatment showed lobular carcinoma with no positive lymph nodes, and your cancer was ER/PR+ and Her-2Neu+. Now, what brings you here today? Patient: For the past three months, I have been experiencing abnormal uterine bleeding. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We performed a transvaginal ultrasound to investigate, and most parameters were within normal range. However, we did find an endometrial thickness of 15mm with heterogeneous echogenicity, but no focal thickening. So, we proceeded with a dilatation and curettage biopsy to take an endometrial biopsy for tissue diagnosis.  Patient: What did the biopsy reveal, doctor? Doctor: The microscopic examination showed epithelial cells infiltrating the endometrial stroma in certain areas, along with some normal endometrial stroma. Our first diagnostic impression was that this might be a metastasis from your primary breast cancer. To confirm this, we requested immunohistochemistry staining for the endometrial specimens. Patient: And what were the results of the staining? Doctor: The staining showed positive results for GATA-3, ER, and mammaglobin antigens, and negative results for PAX-8, CDX-2, and vimentin. The positivity for these markers indicated and supported the diagnosis of lobular breast carcinoma metastasis to your endometrium. Patient: Oh, I see. What should be the next step for me, doctor? Doctor: We will be referring you to oncology for appropriate treatment. They will discuss the best course of action with you based on the findings from the biopsy and staining. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help in figuring out what's going on with my health. [/INST] S: The patient is an 86-year-old postmenopausal Mexican woman with a history of hypertension and previously treated lobular breast cancer in the left breast. She presents with a chief complaint of abnormal uterine bleeding for the past three months. O: Vital signs were not provided. Previous treatment for breast cancer included radical mastectomy, unilateral axillary lymph node dissection, and adjuvant chemotherapy. Recent transvaginal ultrasound showed an endometrial thickness of 15mm with heterogeneous echogenicity. Dilatation and curettage biopsy revealed epithelial cells infiltrating the endometrial stroma, suggestive of metastasis. Immunohistochemistry staining was positive for GATA-3, ER, and mammaglobin, supporting the diagnosis of lobular breast carcinoma metastasis to the endometrium. A: Primary diagnosis is metastatic lobular breast carcinoma to the endometrium, evidenced by clinical history, ultrasound findings, and positive immunohistochemistry markers. Differential diagnosis could include primary endometrial carcinoma, but negative staining for PAX-8, CDX-2, and vimentin supports the primary diagnosis. P: Refer the patient to oncology for further evaluation and management. Discuss potential treatment options based on the extent of metastasis and patient's overall health status. Ensure follow-up to monitor treatment response and manage any complications related to metastatic cancer or therapy. Provide patient education regarding the diagnosis and the importance of follow-up care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 45-year-old, multiparous, overweight female with a history of using levonorgestrel 0.15 mg and estradiol 0.03 mg daily for 13 years. What brings you to our emergency room today? Patient: I've been feeling really unwell for the past week. I've had worsening dyspnea, general malaise, headaches, and ageusia. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any chest pain or discomfort? Patient: Yes, I've had intermittent retrosternal oppressive chest pain that radiates to my back. Doctor: Alright. During the physical exam, we noticed some pulmonary aggregates on auscultation. Your vital signs also showed tachypnea, tachycardia, and desaturation. We've started oxygen therapy using a non-rebreathing mask at 12 L/min to maintain adequate oxygen saturation. We also indicated an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. The arterial blood gases analysis revealed a PAO2/FIO2 ratio of 56, so we've transferred you to the respiratory intensive care unit (ICU). Patient: Okay, so what's the diagnosis? Doctor: Your COVID-19 diagnosis has been confirmed by the positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, showing 50 copies of RNA/reaction. The laboratory test results also showed positive severity predictors, including an elevation of D-dimer (>20 mg/L), troponin I (0.150 ng/mL), ferritin (2934 ng/mL), and lactate dehydrogenase (879 U/L) levels. Patient: What do the other tests show? Doctor: Other admission paraclinical tests showed leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, mild thrombocytopenia, and elevation of transaminases more than three times the laboratory upper limit. These results suggest a possible bacterial pneumonia co-infection, so we've started you on ampicillin-sulbactam as an empiric antibiotic treatment. Patient: Oh, I see. What about my chest pain and shortness of breath? Doctor: Due to the significant elevation of your D-dimer levels, we performed a CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) according to the YEARS protocol. The CTPA results showed a massive pulmonary embolism (PTE) with compromise to the posterior basal segmental artery of the left lower lobe, inferior lingula, and apical-posterior. Patient: That sounds serious. What's the plan moving forward? Doctor: Our team will closely monitor your condition and continue to provide oxygen therapy and antibiotic treatment. We'll also discuss the best course of action to treat the pulmonary embolism and manage your COVID-19 symptoms. Rest assured, we'll do everything we can to help you recover. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello there! I see you've consulted your primary care physician with a chief complaint of a productive cough. Can you tell me more about that? Patient: Yes, I've been having this cough for a while now and it's been bothering me. Doctor: I understand. We detected a large mass lesion in your right lung on your chest X-ray, which led to your referral to our hospital. We then further examined you through contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). Patient: Oh, okay. What did the CT scan find? Doctor: The CT scan revealed a 92-mm mass lesion extending from the middle lobe of your right lung to the upper mediastinum, along with lymphadenopathy of the mediastinum and bilateral neck, swelling of bilateral adrenal glands, intraperitoneal dissemination, and slight pericardial effusion.  Patient: That sounds serious. What does it mean? Doctor: After further examination, you were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the lung, which is a type of lung cancer. It's classified as stage IVB, according to the 8th edition of the TNM classification for lung cancer. We also checked for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement, but neither were detected. Patient: Oh no. What's the treatment plan? Doctor: You were treated with four cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed. Most of the lesions diminished in size, but the intraperitoneal dissemination worsened. So, we initiated Nivolumab therapy as a second-line therapy for you. It's administered at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Patient: Did the Nivolumab therapy help? Doctor: Yes, your serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level before the initiation of nivolumab therapy was 143.7 ng/ml. After two cycles of nivolumab administration, your tumor size decreased, as seen on your chest X-ray and CT.  Patient: That's good news. But I've been experiencing dyspnea lately. Is that related? Doctor: When you returned to our hospital with the complaint of dyspnea, we checked your blood pressure, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation. Your blood pressure was 141/85 mmHg, pulse rate was 111/min, and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. A chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly, and echocardiography indicated massive pericardial effusion. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: You were further diagnosed with cardiac tamponade, which can cause the dyspnea you've been experiencing. However, we didn't detect other immune-related adverse events (irAEs), such as myocarditis. Patient: What's the next step for my treatment? Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition and work on managing the cardiac tamponade. Your serum CEA level has decreased to 22.5 ng/ml, which is a positive sign. We'll keep you updated on any changes and adjust your treatment plan as needed. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient reports a persistent productive cough and recent onset of dyspnea. The patient has been previously diagnosed with stage IVB adenocarcinoma of the lung, with no EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangement detected. The patient has undergone four cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed, followed by Nivolumab therapy due to worsening intraperitoneal dissemination. O: The patient's initial CT scan showed a 92-mm mass in the right lung extending to the upper mediastinum, with associated lymphadenopathy, bilateral adrenal gland swelling, intraperitoneal dissemination, and slight pericardial effusion. Recent tests show a decrease in tumor size post-Nivolumab therapy, but an increase in pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade. Current vital signs are: BP 141/85 mmHg, pulse 111/min, oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Serum CEA levels decreased from 143.7 ng/ml to 22.5 ng/ml after treatment. A: Primary diagnosis is stage IVB adenocarcinoma of the lung with secondary cardiac tamponade. The patient's cancer responded to Nivolumab therapy, but the pericardial effusion has worsened, leading to cardiac tamponade. P: Continue monitoring the patient's cardiac status and manage the cardiac tamponade. Maintain Nivolumab therapy at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, monitor tumor response, and adjust treatment as necessary. Regular follow-ups for echocardiography and serum CEA levels are recommended to assess the progression of pericardial effusion and tumor response. Provide supportive care for symptoms of dyspnea and general cancer management. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I was diagnosed with an astrocytoma a few weeks ago after I presented with new onset seizures. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been started on any medications to control the seizures? Patient: Yes, I was put on levetiracetam, but then I had break-through seizures even though my serum levetiracetam level was therapeutic. Doctor: I see. Have any other medications been added to help with the seizures? Patient: Yeah, Lamotrigine was added to my medications after that. Doctor: How have you been feeling since starting the Lamotrigine? Patient: I've been having a rash, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and fever for four days now. But I don't have any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or joint pains. Doctor: Okay, let's discuss your medical history. Do you have any allergies or significant family history? Patient: I'm allergic to nuts and pollen, but my family history is not significant.  Doctor: Alright. What about your personal situation? Are you employed or do you have any recent travel history? Patient: I'm a stay-at-home mother of one child, and I haven't traveled out of the city in the last 18 months. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Now, let's move on to your physical examination. You mentioned you're in mild distress due to the abdominal pain. Are you also experiencing a fever? Patient: Yes, I feel quite warm. I think I have a fever. Doctor: I can see that you're febrile with a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius. Your pulse is 110 per minute, respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, blood pressure is 124/77 mm Hg in the right upper limb in the supine position, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. I also noticed a reticulated macular erythematous rash on your upper extremities and trunk. Patient: Yeah, the rash is quite itchy and uncomfortable. Doctor: I understand. I also checked your head and neck and did not find any localized swelling, lymphadenopathy, or icterus. There was no oral ulceration or conjunctival injection. Your cardiac and lung exams are within normal limits. However, the abdominal exam revealed right upper quadrant tenderness. Patient: That's where the pain has been, Doctor. Doctor: I see. Your initial lab data demonstrated an eosinophil count of 4 x 10^5/ml, elevated white cell count, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 1231 units/L, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 1026 units/L. Alkaline phosphatase was 362 units/L. We stopped the Lamotrigine as DRESS was considered. Patient: Did my symptoms improve after stopping Lamotrigine? Doctor: Unfortunately, there was no improvement over the next 48 hours as we had expected. We proceeded with an ultrasound of the abdomen and then magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, which confirmed the diagnosis. Patient: Oh, I see. What are the next steps, Doctor? Doctor: We will discuss your test results and formulate a treatment plan to help manage your symptoms and address the underlying issue. It's important to continue monitoring your condition closely and follow up as needed. [/INST] S: The patient, a stay-at-home mother, reports being diagnosed with an astrocytoma a few weeks ago, presenting initially with new onset seizures. Despite therapeutic serum levels of levetiracetam, she experienced breakthrough seizures, prompting the addition of lamotrigine. She now presents with a four-day history of rash, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and fever, but no gastrointestinal or joint symptoms. She has allergies to nuts and pollen and no significant family medical history. O: Physical examination shows the patient is febrile with a temperature of 38°C, pulse 110 bpm, respiratory rate 18 bpm, blood pressure 124/77 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. She exhibits a reticulated macular erythematous rash on her upper extremities and trunk, and right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. Lab results indicate eosinophilia, elevated white cell count, and significantly elevated liver enzymes (ALT 1231 U/L, AST 1026 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 362 U/L). Imaging confirmed the diagnosis after stopping lamotrigine due to suspected DRESS syndrome, with no improvement in symptoms post-discontinuation. A: Primary diagnosis is DRESS syndrome secondary to lamotrigine, with underlying astrocytoma presenting with seizures. Differential diagnosis includes other causes of liver enzyme elevation and rash. The prognosis depends on the management of DRESS and control of seizure activity related to the astrocytoma. P: Discontinue lamotrigine immediately and monitor liver function and rash progression closely. Consider alternative anticonvulsants that do not have a high risk for hypersensitivity reactions. Initiate supportive care for symptoms of DRESS, including fever management and possibly corticosteroids after specialist consultation. Regular follow-up is necessary to monitor the resolution of DRESS symptoms and manage the underlying astrocytoma. Referral to a neurologist for seizure management and a dermatologist for skin manifestations is recommended. Educate the patient on the signs of worsening symptoms and when to seek immediate care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, what brings you in today? Patient: Hi Doctor, I've noticed a rapidly enlarging lesion on my back and it's concerning me. Doctor: I see. Have you ever had any skin issues before? Patient: Yes, I've had multiple skin lesions on my upper body, arms, and face since I was around 18. I've had some lesions removed, and they were confirmed as cylindromas and spiradenomas. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you had any major surgeries related to these skin tumors? Patient: Yes, I was severely affected with multiple scalp tumors and had to undergo total scalp excision with skin grafting. Doctor: That must have been tough. Do you have any affected relatives? Patient: Yeah, I do have some affected relatives. Doctor: Have you had any genetic testing done? Patient: Yes, they did sequencing of the CYLD gene in my peripheral lymphocyte DNA, and they found a novel pathogenic heterozygous truncating mutation. Doctor: I see. Based on your history and the genetic testing results, it seems like you have a condition called CCS. Now, let's talk about the lesion on your back. Have you had any surgeries for it? Patient: Yes, I underwent surgical excision of the lesion, and it was found to be a low-grade spiradenocarcinoma. Doctor: I understand. Have you had any other similar tumors since then? Patient: Two years after that, I had another enlarging tumor removed from my suprapubic skin, and it was confirmed as a primary spiradenocarcinoma. Doctor: It seems like you've been managing this condition well, as neither lesion has recurred in the past five years. Now, let me explain the histopathology report of the tumor from your back. It showed an ulcerated spiradenocarcinoma arising in a spiradenoma. The spiradenocarcinoma had increased cellularity and an absence of the dual cell population seen in spiradenoma. Some cells had a slightly spindled morphology. Patient: Hmm, what does that mean? Doctor: It means that the cancerous cells were arranged in nodules and had minimal cytoplasm. The ductal structures were compressed and pushed to the periphery, as highlighted by carcinoma embryonic antigen staining. However, the data is not shown in the report. Patient: Okay, what about the lymphocytes? Doctor: There was a loss of the diffuse infiltrate of small lymphocytes within the neoplastic nodules. The cells showed increased mitotic activity, with 15 mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields. Patient: And how does that compare to the spiradenoma? Doctor: The spiradenoma was characterized by a dual population of cells arranged in trabeculae, with a mixture of small basaloid cells and a second cell type with a larger, more irregular nucleus and more cytoplasm. The mitotic activity was lower in the spiradenoma compared to the spiradenocarcinoma. Patient: I see. So, what should I do next? Doctor: It's important to continue monitoring your skin for any new or changing lesions. Regular follow-up appointments with your dermatologist and oncologist are crucial for managing your condition. They will assess your skin and recommend any necessary treatments or tests. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to keep an eye on it and follow up with my specialists. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any concerns or notice any changes, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care! [/INST] S: The patient, a known case of cylindromas and spiradenomas, reports a rapidly enlarging lesion on his back, which was surgically excised and diagnosed as low-grade spiradenocarcinoma. He has a history of multiple skin lesions and a total scalp excision with skin grafting due to severe scalp tumors. The patient has a family history of similar conditions and a confirmed novel pathogenic heterozygous truncating mutation in the CYLD gene. He has had no recurrence of the lesions in the past five years. O: The histopathology report of the excised back lesion indicated an ulcerated spiradenocarcinoma arising in a spiradenoma, with increased cellularity, absence of dual cell population, slightly spindled cell morphology, and increased mitotic activity (15 mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields). The spiradenoma showed a dual population of cells with lower mitotic activity. A: The primary diagnosis is spiradenocarcinoma, a malignant transformation of pre-existing spiradenoma, in the context of a genetic predisposition due to a CYLD gene mutation. The differential diagnosis includes recurrence of spiradenocarcinoma or the development of new primary tumors. P: The plan includes regular monitoring for new or changing skin lesions, with follow-up appointments with dermatology and oncology to manage the condition and recommend further treatment or testing as necessary. The patient is advised to remain vigilant about changes in his skin and to report any concerns immediately. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see from your past medical history that you have a pituitary abnormality with central diabetes insipidus and hypogonadism for eight years. You've been treated with desmopressin (DDAVP) and testosterone, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Now, you've presented with shortness of breath and exertional dyspnea, along with a four-month history of weight loss and drenching night sweats. Is that accurate? Patient: Yeah, that's what's been happening. Doctor: We performed a computed tomography scan of your chest, and it revealed a large mediastinal mass. We also did a positron emission topography-computed tomography (PET/CT) scan which demonstrated extensive, 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-avid mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenopathy.  Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: A biopsy of your mediastinal lymph node showed that you have Burkitt lymphoma with t(8;14), and a staging bone marrow was negative for lymphoma. Your Burkitt lymphoma was staged as IVB. We treated you with four cycles of R-CODOX/M/IVAC, which includes Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Oncovin (Vincristine), Doxorubicin, Ifosfamide, Vepesid (etoposide), and Ara-C (Cytarabine). Methotrexate was held due to pleural effusions, and ifosfamide was deleted in cycles 2 and 4 due to neurotoxicity.  Patient: Yeah, I remember those treatments. Doctor: Additionally, you received involved field radiotherapy of 40 Gy in 20 fractions to residual mediastinal/subcarinal/pleural disease. During this time, you were also diagnosed with central hypothyroidism and began treatment with levothyroxine.  Patient: Yes, I've been taking that medication as well. Doctor: After completing the chemotherapeutic regimen, you experienced waxing and waning pain in your lower back and knees, as well as bilateral leg weakness. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, the pain and weakness have been bothering me. Doctor: We performed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your knee, which showed infiltrative lesions within the distal femoral metaphysis/diaphysis and proximal tibial diaphysis. However, a PET/CT scan was negative for PET-avid bone disease.  Patient: So, what does that mean? Doctor: A bone biopsy was suboptimal with nonspecific findings, and bilateral iliac crest biopsies revealed mildly hypercellular bone marrow with a small non-paratrabecular lymphohistiocytic aggregate. Over the past six months, you've shown progressive failure to thrive with new onset dysphagia.  Patient: Yeah, it's been tough, and I've been having trouble swallowing too. Doctor: We'll continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as needed. It's crucial that you keep us informed of any changes in your symptoms, so we can provide the best care possible. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, with a history of pituitary abnormality, central diabetes insipidus, and hypogonadism, reports recent symptoms of shortness of breath, exertional dyspnea, weight loss, and night sweats over four months. The patient has been treated with desmopressin and testosterone for the past conditions and levothyroxine for newly diagnosed central hypothyroidism. He also describes waxing and waning pain in the lower back and knees, bilateral leg weakness, and new onset dysphagia. O: A CT scan revealed a large mediastinal mass. PET/CT scans showed extensive FDG-avid mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenopathy. Biopsy confirmed Burkitt lymphoma with t(8;14). The patient was treated with R-CODOX/M/IVAC chemotherapy, with modifications due to side effects, and involved field radiotherapy of 40 Gy in 20 fractions. MRI of the knee indicated infiltrative lesions in the distal femoral and proximal tibial areas, but a PET/CT was negative for PET-avid bone disease. Iliac crest biopsies showed mildly hypercellular bone marrow with a small lymphohistiocytic aggregate. A: Primary diagnosis is Burkitt lymphoma, stage IVB, currently post-treatment with residual complications including central hypothyroidism, bone pain, leg weakness, and dysphagia. Differential diagnosis includes metastatic bone disease, though current imaging is inconclusive. P: Continue monitoring the patient's lymphoma status and manage residual symptoms and complications. Adjust chemotherapy and radiotherapy based on tolerance and response. Manage pain and weakness with appropriate analgesics and physical therapy. Address dysphagia with dietary modifications and consider gastroenterology referral if symptoms persist. Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor the progression of symptoms and adjust treatment plans accordingly. Ensure patient adherence to levothyroxine and other supportive therapies. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, welcome back. I see that you presented to our facility 4 months ago as a self-referral. You mentioned that you have been suffering from recurrent bilateral pleural effusion and thickening for the past 2 years, is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: During our initial workup, we found that you had a positive QuantiFERON-TB test, but your sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture were negative. We discharged you to follow-up in our pulmonary clinic. Can you tell me if you've had any new symptoms since then? Patient: Well, I've started having new-onset headaches and seizures recently. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. During your physical examination, we noticed bitemporal visual deficits. We performed a brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which revealed numerous infratentorial and supratentorial ring-enhancing brain lesions with vasogenic edema. Our differentials at this point were neurocysticercosis, tuberculomas, toxoplasmosis, lymphoma, and metastatic brain cancer.  Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. Doctor: To further investigate, we decided to perform a lumbar puncture (LP) to rule in what we believed to be an infectious etiology. The LP showed an opening pressure of 370 mm H2O, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell count of 8 × 103/µL, and CSF glucose and protein were 50 mg/dL and 89 mm/dL, respectively, with a 55% lymphocyte predominance. Patient: Okay, what does that mean? Doctor: These results point towards an infectious cause. We also screened you for HIV with an Ab/Ag (antibody/antigen) screen, which was nonreactive. Based on our high suspicion for TB, we've empirically placed you on 4 anti-TB medications and a steroid.  Patient: I see. Doctor: We also performed a pleural biopsy, which confirmed TB as the cause of your symptoms. We will continue with the anti-TB medications and steroid treatment. It's important that you follow up with us regularly to monitor your progress. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to follow up. Doctor: You're welcome. If you experience any new symptoms or worsening of your current symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact us. We're here to help you. [/INST] S: The patient, who self-referred 4 months ago, reports suffering from recurrent bilateral pleural effusion and thickening for the past 2 years. Recently, the patient has experienced new-onset headaches and seizures. O: Initial tests showed a positive QuantiFERON-TB test, negative sputum AFB smear and culture. Recent brain CT and MRI revealed multiple infratentorial and supratentorial ring-enhancing lesions with vasogenic edema. Physical examination noted bitemporal visual deficits. Lumbar puncture indicated an opening pressure of 370 mm H2O, CSF WBC count of 8 × 10^3/µL, CSF glucose 50 mg/dL, CSF protein 89 mg/dL, with 55% lymphocytes. HIV Ab/Ag screen was nonreactive. Pleural biopsy confirmed tuberculosis. A: Primary diagnosis is central nervous system tuberculosis, evidenced by imaging, CSF findings, and confirmed TB in pleural biopsy. Differential diagnoses included neurocysticercosis, toxoplasmosis, lymphoma, and metastatic brain cancer, which are less likely given the biopsy results and clinical findings. P: The patient is currently on a regimen of four anti-TB medications and a steroid. Regular follow-ups in the pulmonary clinic are scheduled to monitor treatment response and manage any side effects. The patient is advised to report any new or worsening symptoms immediately. Education on TB treatment adherence and potential side effects of medications has been provided. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your medical history, especially regarding your right hand? Patient: Well, I had a bicycle accident about two months ago and hurt my right hand. The X-rays didn't show any fractures, so they thought it was a wrist sprain and put a plaster cast on it for 15 days. Doctor: How has the swelling and pain been since the accident? Patient: The swelling never really went away, and my hand is still very painful. Physiotherapy and manual drainage didn't help either. Doctor: I see. Were there any other tests or treatments done to identify the cause of the swelling and pain? Patient: Yes, they did a bone scan to check for Algodystrophy and a Venous Doppler ultrasound to rule out phlebitis. Both tests were negative. They even suspected self-injury, but MRI angiography ruled out arteriovenous malformation. Doctor: Did they try any other treatments for the swelling and pain? Patient: They tried massage, biphosphonate treatment, and two series of intravenous immunoglobulin, but nothing improved my condition. At one point, they thought I might have a psychiatric disease like Munchausen syndrome or Secretan's syndrome. Doctor: Were any personality tests or psychiatric evaluations done? Patient: Yes, but the results were all negative. Doctor: I understand that the persistent swelling and pain led to a total impairment of your hand and recurrent local infections. Did you have any consultations with specialists in lymphology? Patient: Yes, the first specialist wanted to continue with physiotherapy, but I sought a second opinion at your center. Doctor: Our noncontrast magnetic resonance lymphography (NCMRL) showed local lymph flow blockage at your wrist and lymphatic malformations in your entire forearm. This requires a surgical procedure. Patient: What does the procedure involve? Doctor: First, we'll perform an extrafascial dermolipectomy to remove all fibrous and nonfunctional tissue obstructing lymphatic circulation in the hand. This will also remove the strangulation at the wrist. Then, a month after the dermolipectomy, we'll perform a free flap containing some lymph nodes, which will be autologous and harvested at your groin level. Patient: Will this finally help with the swelling and pain? Doctor: Yes, these procedures should significantly improve your condition and allow you to regain function in your hand. [/INST] S: Patient reports persistent swelling and pain in the right hand following a bicycle accident two months ago. Initial treatment with a plaster cast for a suspected wrist sprain did not alleviate symptoms. Subsequent interventions, including physiotherapy, manual drainage, massage, bisphosphonate treatment, and intravenous immunoglobulin, were ineffective. Tests including X-rays, bone scan, Venous Doppler ultrasound, and MRI angiography were negative for fractures, Algodystrophy, phlebitis, and arteriovenous malformation. Psychiatric evaluations were also negative. O: Current examination shows total impairment of the right hand with recurrent local infections. Noncontrast magnetic resonance lymphography (NCMRL) revealed local lymph flow blockage at the wrist and lymphatic malformations in the entire forearm. A: The primary diagnosis is lymphatic obstruction and malformation in the right forearm and wrist, likely secondary to trauma from the bicycle accident. Differential diagnoses such as Algodystrophy, phlebitis, arteriovenous malformation, and psychiatric conditions like Munchausen syndrome or Secretan's syndrome have been ruled out. P: The management plan includes surgical intervention with an extrafascial dermolipectomy to remove fibrous and nonfunctional tissue obstructing lymphatic circulation, followed by a free flap procedure with autologous lymph nodes harvested from the groin. This approach aims to restore lymphatic flow and alleviate symptoms. The patient will continue to be monitored for infection control and postoperative recovery, with additional physiotherapy as needed to regain hand function. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, we're here to evaluate your two-month-old daughter for seizures and hypotonia. She was presented at the Pediatric Department of Imam Reza Hospital in October 2016. I understand you have had a sibling who died at the age of 7 months with similar symptoms, and no specific metabolic assessment was conducted. Mother: Yes, that's correct. We are really worried about our daughter. Doctor: I see that your pregnancy had induced hypertension. Your daughter was a full-term baby, with a birth weight of 2500 grams, a length of 45 cm, and a head circumference of 32 cm. Her APGAR score was normal. She was admitted to the hospital on the fifth day of life with a chief complaint of neonatal jaundice. Is that correct? Mother: Yes, that's right. Doctor: At 2 months old, she had a history of fever, poor feeding, and vomiting for 2 days after routine vaccination. Her condition deteriorated with tonic-clonic seizures, difficulties in breathing, severe restlessness, lethargy, hypotonia, and she was in a coma for 1 day during her admission in the intensive care unit. Is that accurate? Mother: Yes, that's what happened. Doctor: After that admission, she had four more episodes with similar signs and symptoms, and between these crises, she was asymptomatic. Developmentally, at 8 months, she could not babble, had head drop, and could not sit with support. Is that correct? Mother: Yes, she hasn't been able to sit or babble. Doctor: During the physical examination, we found no organomegaly or hearing or visual abnormalities. The neurological examination showed hypotonia and decreased deep tendon reflexes. Is there anything else you want to share about her symptoms? Mother: No, that covers everything we've noticed. Doctor: We conducted an Arterial Blood Gas test, which revealed metabolic acidosis with a PH of 7.2, HCO3 of 5 mmol/L, base excess of -20, and pCO2 of 12.5 mmHg during her first acute attack. Also, we detected a high level of blood sugar and ketonuria. Her plasma showed normal Ammoniae (72 µmol/L) and lactate (11 mg/dl). We also found negative urine and blood culture, normal serum electrolytes, liver and renal, and thyroid function tests. The CSF analysis showed negative results for infection. Are you following me so far? Mother: Yes, I understand. Doctor: We also performed a Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which showed unspecific low signal intensity basal. Based on these findings, we will continue to monitor her condition and develop a treatment plan to help manage her symptoms. It's essential to keep an eye on her development and report any changes or new symptoms. Do you have any questions or concerns? Mother: No, thank you for explaining everything. We just want the best care for our daughter. [/INST] S: The patient, a two-month-old female, presented with seizures, hypotonia, and a history of similar symptoms leading to the death of a sibling at 7 months. The mother reports the patient's symptoms began after routine vaccination at 2 months, including fever, poor feeding, vomiting, tonic-clonic seizures, breathing difficulties, severe restlessness, lethargy, and a transient coma. Developmentally, the patient is unable to babble, has head drop, and cannot sit with support. There is no reported organomegaly, hearing, or visual abnormalities. O: Physical examination revealed hypotonia and decreased deep tendon reflexes. Arterial Blood Gas analysis during an acute attack showed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.2, HCO3 5 mmol/L, base excess -20, pCO2 12.5 mmHg). Additional findings included high blood sugar, ketonuria, normal ammonia (72 µmol/L), and lactate (11 mg/dl) levels. Urine and blood cultures were negative, as were serum electrolytes, liver, renal, and thyroid function tests. CSF analysis was unremarkable for infection. Brain MRI indicated unspecific low signal intensity basal. A: The primary diagnosis is a metabolic disorder, likely an inherited metabolic disorder, given the family history and clinical presentation. Differential diagnoses include other causes of neonatal seizures and metabolic acidosis. The prognosis depends on the specific underlying disorder and response to treatment. P: The management plan includes continued monitoring of metabolic status and neurological condition. Initiate supportive care for symptoms, including management of seizures and acidosis. Genetic counseling and metabolic specialist consultation are recommended to further evaluate the potential inherited metabolic disorder. Educate the parents about the signs of metabolic crises and the importance of immediate medical attention. Regular developmental assessments and adjustments to the care plan as needed based on her progress and findings from ongoing evaluations. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've presented with a 6 mm bluish nodule that has been slowly growing on your forehead. Can you tell me how long it's been there? Patient: Yeah, I noticed it a couple of months ago, and it's been getting bigger. Doctor: Okay, we performed an excisional biopsy to examine the tissue. It revealed a pigmented lesion with rare mitotic figures and multiple microscopic satellites, extending into the fat. This puts it at Clark level V, with a depth of at least 4 mm. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does that mean? Doctor: Clark level V means that the lesion has invaded the fat layer of your skin. However, the sentinel lymph node biopsy came back negative for neoplasm, which is a good sign. Patient: That's a relief. So what's next? Doctor: We performed immunohistochemical stains for Melan-A and HMB-45, and both were diffusely reactive. Additionally, -catenin showed non-specific cytoplasmic staining. Ki-67 demonstrated a low proliferative index, with less than 5% in tumor cells. Patient: What does all that mean? Doctor: These results mean that the lesion is not highly aggressive or rapidly growing. We also conducted a four-color in situ hybridization to rule out melanoma, and the results were normal. Patient: So it's not melanoma? That's great news! Doctor: Yes, it's definitely good news. We performed further tests, including fusion analysis for 104 genes using targeted RNA sequencing, which did not reveal any gene rearrangements, including PRKCA and PRKAR1A. Targeted mutation analysis for over 50 cancer-related genes showed an oncogenic mutation called GNA11 c.626A>T p.Q209L. Patient: Oh, okay. What's next then? Doctor: We carried out whole-genome DNA methylation profiling and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) cluster analysis. The genome-wide copy number profiles determined from the DNA methylation data did not reveal significant changes. t-SNE cluster analysis matched your case to a group of melanocytomas. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: Melanocytomas are generally benign tumors. However, we'll continue to monitor the lesion and conduct studies to explore improved diagnostic and management approaches for pigmented lesions when there is a concern for malignancy. Patient: I appreciate all the tests and explanations. What should I do now? Doctor: At this point, we'll keep an eye on the lesion and have you come in for regular check-ups. If there are any changes or concerns, please let us know immediately. We'll do our best to ensure the best possible management of your condition. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I feel better knowing what's going on and that you're keeping a close eye on it.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I'm here because I have a nasal mass, and I'm not sure what it is. Doctor: I see. Let's first take a look at your preoperative imaging studies to get a better understanding of the mass. It appears to be a vascular lesion. We will need to perform an excision to remove the mass and examine it more closely. Patient: Okay, doctor. What's the next step then? Doctor: The next step is for you to undergo an incomplete excision of the mass. This will help us study it and determine the best course of action. Patient: Alright, so what happened after the excision? Doctor: After the excision, we examined the mass and the initial histopathological findings documented that it is a sinonasal basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. This is a type of cancer that occurs in the nasal cavity. Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. What do we do next? Doctor: Don't worry, we will take care of it. The next step is for you to undergo an endoscopic craniofacial resection and reconstruction. This procedure will remove the cancerous cells and reconstruct the affected area. Patient: I understand. Please go ahead with the procedure. Doctor: The procedure was successful. However, due to the complex tumor presentation, we decided to send the tumor sample for further analysis. Specifically, we performed a FISH cytogenetics: ESW-FLI-1 fusion analysis. Patient: What does that mean, doctor? Doctor: The fusion analysis helps us to better understand the genetic makeup of the tumor. This information can be useful in determining the most effective treatment options for you. Patient: I see. So, what are the results of the analysis? Doctor: The results are still pending. Once we have them, we will discuss the best course of action for your treatment. In the meantime, please be patient and take care of yourself. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you through this process. [/INST] S: The patient presents with a chief complaint of a nasal mass, initially unsure of its nature. The patient underwent a preoperative evaluation indicating a vascular lesion, followed by an incomplete excision for further examination. Postoperative histopathological findings confirmed the mass as sinonasal basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. O: Physical examination and preoperative imaging studies identified a vascular lesion in the nasal cavity. Histopathological examination post-incomplete excision confirmed sinonasal basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. The patient subsequently underwent an endoscopic craniofacial resection and reconstruction. FISH cytogenetics for ESW-FLI-1 fusion analysis was performed, with results pending. A: The primary diagnosis is sinonasal basaloid squamous cell carcinoma, a type of cancer in the nasal cavity. The patient has undergone initial surgical management with endoscopic craniofacial resection and reconstruction. Pending cytogenetic analysis results will provide further insights into the genetic makeup of the tumor, which may influence additional treatment options. P: Continue to monitor the patient postoperatively and await the results of the FISH cytogenetics analysis. Once the results are available, discuss further treatment options which may include additional surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy depending on the stage and genetic characteristics of the tumor. Provide psychological support and patient education regarding the nature of the diagnosis and the importance of follow-up. Schedule a follow-up appointment to review cytogenetics results and plan subsequent treatment steps. Encourage the patient to reach out with any questions or concerns in the interim. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been experiencing knee pain that seems to increase at night. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you had any similar issues in the past? Patient: Yes, I had an OBL of the posterior spinal column treated 5 years ago. Doctor: I see. That OBL was diagnosed through a CT scan and an MRI, right? Patient: Yes, they demonstrated an osteolytic lesion of the second lumbar vertebrae. Doctor: I remember reviewing the histological slides and confirming the OBL diagnosis. Now, let's focus on your current knee pain. Is it similar to the pain you experienced with the OBL? Patient: Yes, it feels identical. The pain is almost constant and gets worse at night. Doctor: Does it get relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? Patient: Yes, taking those does help. Doctor: Are there any limitations in your knee movement or any neurovascular deficit? Patient: No, I can move my knee just fine and don't have any other issues. Doctor: Good to know. We performed a CT scan and an MRI to get a better understanding of your knee pain. The CT scan showed a small nidus without sclerosis, and the MRI confirmed the nidus with inflammation of the surrounding tissue. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We also performed a bone scintigraphy to rule out more lesions. It showed increased activity in your left distal femur. Patient: What does that mean for my treatment? Doctor: Before starting radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment, we obtained a biopsy sample using the Bonopty set. With you under spinal anesthesia, a core-needle biopsy was performed under CT guidance. Patient: Okay, and what happened next? Doctor: We placed the needle electrode inside the nidus and performed RFA through the same tract with a 5-mm radiofrequency probe heated to 90 °C for 5 minutes, using the radiofrequency generator. Patient: So, what's the diagnosis? Doctor: The diagnosis is an OBL. We'll continue to monitor your progress and determine if any further treatment is necessary. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing knee pain that worsens at night, similar to previous pain associated with an osteolytic lesion (OBL) of the second lumbar vertebrae treated 5 years ago. The pain is relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and there are no limitations in knee movement or neurovascular deficits. O: Previous history includes an OBL of the lumbar spine confirmed via CT, MRI, and histological analysis. Current imaging (CT and MRI) of the knee shows a small nidus without sclerosis and inflammation of surrounding tissue. Bone scintigraphy indicates increased activity in the left distal femur. A core-needle biopsy was performed under CT guidance, followed by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using a 5-mm probe at 90 °C for 5 minutes. A: The primary diagnosis is an osteolytic lesion (OBL) in the left distal femur, similar to the patient's past spinal OBL. The symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis. P: The patient underwent RFA treatment for the OBL, and ongoing monitoring of the lesion's response to treatment is planned. Further treatment options may be considered based on the monitoring results. The patient is advised to continue using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as needed for pain relief and to report any changes in symptoms or new symptoms. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 32-year-old multiparous woman. You've been admitted today at 37 2/7 weeks for induction of labor due to abnormal antenatal testing. Can you tell me more about your previous pregnancy and delivery? Patient: Yes, I had a prior cesarean delivery because my labor stopped at 7 cm dilation. Doctor: I understand. And you've had extensive counseling about your choices for this delivery, which led you to decide on a TOLAC. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: Great. So, your initial cervical exam showed 2 cm dilation and 50% effacement. We induced your labor with oxytocin, and an amniotomy was performed at 5 cm dilation, with clear fluid noted. Your progression from 2 cm to 5 cm took about 10 hours, and then it took another 3.5 hours to progress to 6 cm. How did you feel during this time? Patient: I was okay at first, but then I started to have a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding. Doctor: Yes, I see that in your chart. Additionally, there was minimal fetal heart rate variability and variable decelerations that did not improve with intrauterine resuscitation. Due to concerns for a possible uterine rupture or placental abruption, we proceeded to the operating room for a repeat cesarean delivery. Patient: What happened during the surgery? Doctor: Upon entry into the abdomen, there was no uterine rupture or dehiscence, nor was there evidence of a significant placental abruption. You delivered a male infant with a weight of 2659 g and Apgar scores of 9 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes, respectively. The arterial cord pH was 7.26. Patient: That's a relief. So, everything went well with the delivery? Doctor: Yes, there was no extension of the hysterotomy following the delivery of the infant. However, after repairing the hysterotomy, we noticed that your bladder was distended and edematous, despite the presence of a patent Foley catheter. This finding prompted a vaginal exam to assist in evaluating the integrity of the lower uterine segment behind the bladder, due to concern for an occult uterine rupture or dehiscence. Patient: What did the vaginal exam show? Doctor: The vaginal exam revealed a spontaneous detachment of the anterior rim of the cervix from approximately 9 to 3 o'clock. The avulsed portion of the cervix appeared necrotic, and there was no bleeding noted at the site of cervical detachment. We completed the cesarean delivery, and an attempt was made to repair the site of the detachment vaginally. However, the entirety of the cervix completely detached during the process. Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. Was there a lot of bleeding? Doctor: No, there was no excessive bleeding during the procedure. Your condition is stable now, and we will continue to monitor you closely during your recovery. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your explanation and care. [/INST] S: The patient is a 32-year-old multiparous woman at 37 2/7 weeks gestation admitted for induction of labor due to abnormal antenatal testing. She reports a history of a prior cesarean delivery at 7 cm dilation and chose a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) for this delivery. She experienced moderate vaginal bleeding during labor and expressed concerns about her symptoms and the outcomes of her delivery. O: Initial cervical exam showed 2 cm dilation and 50% effacement. Labor was induced with oxytocin and progressed to 5 cm over 10 hours, followed by 3.5 hours to reach 6 cm. An amniotomy was performed at 5 cm dilation with clear amniotic fluid. Fetal monitoring indicated minimal heart rate variability with variable decelerations. Repeat cesarean delivery was performed due to suspected uterine rupture or placental abruption. Intraoperative findings included no uterine rupture or significant placental abruption. The patient delivered a male infant with a birth weight of 2659 g and Apgar scores of 9 at 1 and 5 minutes. Arterial cord pH was 7.26. Post-delivery, the patient had a distended and edematous bladder with a patent Foley catheter. A vaginal exam revealed a spontaneous detachment of the anterior rim of the cervix from 9 to 3 o'clock, appearing necrotic without active bleeding. The cervix detached completely during an attempt at surgical repair. A: The primary diagnosis is successful TOLAC with repeat cesarean delivery. Complications included suspected but unconfirmed uterine rupture or placental abruption, and confirmed cervical avulsion without significant hemorrhage. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the stable postoperative condition and successful delivery of a healthy infant. P: The patient will be closely monitored during her postoperative recovery. Management includes pain control, infection prophylaxis, and monitoring for signs of infection or hemorrhage. Psychological support will be provided due to the traumatic nature of the delivery complications. Follow-up will include a postpartum visit to assess recovery and discuss future reproductive health. Referral to a gynecological specialist for further evaluation and management of the cervical avulsion may be considered. Education regarding signs of complications such as infection or excessive bleeding will be provided before discharge. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you were admitted to Mudanjiang Forestry Central Hospital on May 23, 2013, for tick-borne diseases. Can you please tell me about your chief complaints at that time? Patient: Yes, I remember I had dizziness, gait disturbance, and headache. Doctor: Okay, and did anything happen prior to those symptoms appearing? Patient: Yeah, two weeks before I was admitted, an engorged adult tick was removed from my supraclavicular fossae. Doctor: I see. And did you experience any symptoms after the tick removal? Patient: Eleven days after the tick was removed, I got a fever of 39.0 °C and a headache, so I went to a local clinic. Doctor: What treatment did they provide you at the clinic? Patient: They gave me compound paracetamol tablets for two days, but there was no improvement, and my fever went up to 42.0 °C. Doctor: I understand. Upon your admission, a routine exam was conducted, which showed a body temperature of 39.5 °C, blood pressure of 125/70 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, and respiration of 18 breaths/min. The neurological check revealed moderate nuchal rigidity. Were there any ulceration or exudation observed around the tick bite location? Patient: No, there wasn't any ulceration or exudation, and no erythematous lesions were found on my trunk either. Doctor: Alright. A routine blood test was performed, and the results showed that your white blood cell (WBC) count was 7.6 × 10^9/L, and red blood cell (RBC) count was 4.6 × 10^12/L, both within the normal range. However, your neutrophil-granulocyte proportion was substantially elevated at 91.6%, and your C-reactive proteins (CRPs) were 64.136 mg/L, indicating an inflammatory response. Did you have any other laboratory tests done? Patient: Yes, they also tested my blood for alanine aminotransferase, which was 53.1 U/L, aspartate transaminase, which was 54.3 U/L, and gamma-glutamyl transferase, which was 78.0 U/L. Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. Additionally, 0.15 g/L protein was detected in your urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests revealed 0.4 g/L of protein, 4.28 mmol/L of glucose, and 125.3 mmol/L of chloride. Based on these results, we will need to monitor your condition and follow up on your treatment plan. Please make sure to attend any scheduled appointments and report any new or worsening symptoms immediately. [/INST] S: The patient reported initial symptoms of dizziness, gait disturbance, and headache, which began after the removal of an engorged adult tick from the supraclavicular fossae. Eleven days post-removal, the patient developed a fever of 39.0 °C and worsening headache, leading to a clinic visit. Despite treatment with compound paracetamol tablets, the fever escalated to 42.0 °C. O: Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were recorded with a temperature of 39.5 °C, blood pressure 125/70 mm Hg, pulse 60 beats/min, and respiration 18 breaths/min. Neurological examination showed moderate nuchal rigidity. No ulceration or erythematous lesions were observed.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see you've presented to the ED with six episodes of left-sided headaches in the past two and a half weeks. Can you tell me more about the symptoms you've been experiencing? Patient: Yeah, I've been having photophobia, nausea, and vomiting along with the headaches. Doctor: I see. It seems like you've had some improvement in your symptoms with the use of medications such as prochlorperazine, diphenhydramine, and ketorolac. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, those medications have been helping me feel a bit better. Doctor: You've also had multiple evaluations in the ED, including a negative head computed tomography (CT) and negative brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We've provided you with prescriptions for medications that were helpful in the ED, but you keep returning with a headache. Is that right? Patient: Yeah, the headaches just don't seem to go away. Doctor: Have you had any history of migraines prior to your first presentation? Patient: No, I've never had migraines before. Doctor: Hmm, we initially labeled your condition as ""migraines"" and treated you repeatedly with ""migraine cocktails."" During your last visit, you were seen about two hours before shift change, and you were reported to be alert, oriented, and with a Glasglow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15. Do you remember that? Patient: Yes, I remember. Doctor: After that visit, you received prochlorperazine, diphenhydramine, and ketorolac and were signed out as “a migraine, medicated, discharge pending improvement.” However, when you were examined after sign-out, you appeared drowsy, presumably due to prochlorperazine and diphenhydramine. Is that correct? Patient: Yeah, I was feeling really drowsy. Doctor: You were then put under observation in the ED, and three hours after medication administration, we conducted frequent examinations. During those examinations, your GCS was 10, and you never returned to your neurologic baseline per your family at the bedside. Can you confirm that? Patient: Yes, my family mentioned that I wasn't acting like myself. Doctor: Your family also noticed that you were answering questions about your history incorrectly and displaying a change from your ""normal"" effect. Is that right? Patient: Yeah, they said I was acting strangely. Doctor: Initially, your diagnosis was a migraine headache, and we provided treatment for that. However, when we discovered you had an altered mental status instead of just being drowsy from the medication, we expanded the differential diagnosis. We'll continue to evaluate your condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Please keep us informed of any changes in your symptoms or if you have any concerns. Patient: Okay, thank you for your help, Doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, presenting to the ED, reports experiencing six episodes of left-sided headaches over the past two and a half weeks, accompanied by photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. The patient denies any prior history of migraines. Despite treatment with medications including prochlorperazine, diphenhydramine, and ketorolac, which provided some relief, the headaches persist. The patient also experienced altered mental status and was observed to be drowsy and not acting like themselves according to family observations. O: The patient has undergone multiple evaluations in the ED, including a head CT and brain MRI, both of which were negative. During the last visit, the patient was alert and oriented with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15, but post-medication, the GCS dropped to 10, indicating a significant change in neurological status. The patient appeared drowsy, likely due to the effects of prochlorperazine and diphenhydramine. A: The initial diagnosis was migraine headaches, treated with a migraine cocktail. However, the persistence of headaches and the recent presentation of altered mental status, not solely attributable to medication effects, suggest a need to reconsider the diagnosis and possibly expand the differential diagnoses. This could include other causes of headache and altered mental status that may not have been previously considered. P: Continue monitoring the patient's neurological status closely and consider further diagnostic evaluations to explore other potential causes of the symptoms. Adjust the treatment plan based on these findings and provide supportive care as needed. Educate the patient and family about the importance of monitoring symptoms and reporting any changes or concerns. Ensure follow-up in the neurology clinic for ongoing management and reassessment of the patient's condition. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, what brings you in today? Patient: Hey doc, I've been having this intermittent lower abdominal pain, burning micturition, and a weird lump in my abdomen for the last three months. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me where exactly the lump is located? Patient: Sure, it's on my right side, in the lumbar region. Doctor: Okay, let's take a closer look. Oh, I see it now. The lump moves on inspiration and measures about 3.7 cm by 2.6 cm. Let's run some tests to see what's going on. Patient: Yeah, that sounds good. Doctor: Your renal function tests show that everything is within the normal range. However, the abdominal ultrasound reveals a calculus measuring about 2 cm by 1.8 cm in the renal pelvis, and mild hydronephrosis on your right side. We also noticed that your left kidney is not in its usual location, but rather, there's a second kidney on your right side, fused to your right kidney. Patient: Oh wow, that's strange. Doctor: Yes, it's quite unusual. We performed a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of your abdomen, which confirmed our findings from the ultrasound. Patient: So what does that mean exactly? Doctor: When we administered an intravenous non-ionic contrast agent, we noticed that there's a single ureter draining the collecting system of both your kidneys and opening into your urinary bladder on the same side. Your left ureter is absent. Additionally, we observed a subtle thickening of your urinary bladder wall. Patient: What about blood supply? Doctor: The fused kidneys are supplied by two renal arteries originating from your left internal iliac artery. A three-dimensional volume-rendering technique shows that there's a single renal vein draining the fused renal parenchyma into the inferior vena cava. And as I mentioned earlier, there's a single ureter draining the crossed fused kidneys into your urinary bladder on the same side. Patient: Are there any other abnormalities? Doctor: We didn't see any associated congenital skeletal abnormalities. However, we would like to keep you under follow-up, as cases like these may show malignant transformation in the future. Patient: Oh, okay. I understand. Doctor: Don't worry, we'll keep a close eye on your condition and ensure you receive the best possible care. Just make sure to attend your follow-up appointments. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient reports intermittent lower abdominal pain, burning micturition, and a palpable lump in the right lumbar region, present for the last three months. O: Physical examination revealed a mobile lump in the right lumbar region, measuring 3.7 cm by 2.6 cm. Renal function tests are within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasound showed a 2 cm by 1.8 cm calculus in the right renal pelvis and mild hydronephrosis. Non-contrast CT and subsequent studies with intravenous non-ionic contrast confirmed the presence of crossed fused renal ectopia with a single ureter and absent left ureter. The fused kidneys are supplied by two arteries from the left internal iliac artery and drained by a single renal vein into the inferior vena cava. There is also subtle thickening of the urinary bladder wall. No congenital skeletal abnormalities were noted. A: The primary diagnosis is crossed fused renal ectopia with associated renal calculus and mild hydronephrosis. Differential diagnosis includes other causes of lower abdominal pain and urinary abnormalities. The risk of malignant transformation in the ectopic tissue is noted as a potential complication. P: Plan to manage the renal calculus conservatively with hydration and pain management initially. Schedule a follow-up for potential lithotripsy if symptoms persist or worsen. Monitor the hydronephrosis and renal function periodically. Address the bladder wall thickening with a follow-up cystoscopy to rule out malignancy. Educate the patient on the importance of follow-up appointments due to the risk of complications, including malignancy. Referral to a nephrologist for ongoing management of the renal anomaly and a urologist for the calculus and bladder issues is recommended. Ensure patient compliance and understanding of the congenital nature and implications of his condition. </s>"

Over the past six months, I've been experiencing progressive unsteadiness and weakness in both of my lower limbs. It's actually gotten worse, and now I can't walk without a walking aid. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other issues recently? Patient: Yeah, I've had this chronic neck stiffness for over two years now, but I didn't seek any intervention for it. Doctor: Have you had any problems with hand dexterity, like difficulty using chopsticks, buttoning your shirt, or picking up a coin? Patient: No, I haven't had any issues like that. Doctor: Alright, let's do a thorough neurological examination to check for any signs of myelopathy.  [After the examination] Doctor: Your examination showed significant signs of myelopathy in your lower limbs. Your muscle power in both lower limbs, according to the medical research council's (MRC) grading, is 4/5. Your deep tendon reflexes, such as the knee jerk and ankle jerk, are exaggerated in both lower limbs. Babinski's sign is positive bilaterally. You also had difficulty getting up from an armless chair and were unable to perform a tandem gait. Interestingly, you did not demonstrate any upper limb signs. Your sensory-motor function and reflexes are normal in both upper limbs, and Hoffman's sign is negative. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does it all mean? Doctor: Your Japanese orthopaedic association (JOA) score is 14/17, which indicates a grade 1 disability. We took some X-rays of your cervical spine, and they showed signs of degeneration with loss of cervical lordosis and anterior osteophytes involving C3 to C6. We also performed a computerised tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which revealed an extensive OPLL from C3-T3 causing significant canal compromise. Patient: So, what's the plan now, doc? Doctor: Considering your clinico-radiological presentation and to prevent any further deterioration of your neurological status, we need to plan for immediate surgery. We will administer Dexamethasone 8mg intravenously prior to the procedure. The surgery will involve a C3-T3 posterior decompression and instrumented postero. This should help alleviate your symptoms and prevent further damage. Patient: Okay, I understand. Let's go ahead with the surgery. Thanks, doc. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to ensure a successful outcome and improve your quality of life. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

O: Neurological examination revealed significant signs of myelopathy in the lower limbs, with muscle power graded 4/5 according to the Medical Research Council's scale. Both knee and ankle jerk reflexes were exaggerated, and Babinski's sign was positive bilaterally. The patient struggled with rising from an armless chair and could not perform a tandem gait. Upper limb sensory-motor function and reflexes were normal, and Hoffman's sign was negative. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score was 14/17, indicating grade 1 disability. Cervical spine X-rays showed degeneration with loss of cervical lordosis and anterior osteophytes from C3 to C6. CT and MRI revealed extensive ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) from C3 to T3 causing significant canal compromise. A: The primary diagnosis is cervical myelopathy secondary to extensive OPLL with significant spinal canal compromise. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of myelopathy such as multiple sclerosis or spinal tumors, but these are less likely given the imaging findings and clinical presentation. P: Immediate surgical intervention is planned to prevent further neurological deterioration. The procedure will be a C3-T3 posterior decompression and instrumentation. Pre-operative management includes administration of Dexamethasone 8mg IV. Post-operative care will focus on monitoring and rehabilitation to improve mobility and quality of life. The patient has consented to the surgery. Further education regarding post-surgical care and follow-up will be provided to ensure understanding and compliance. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello Patient A, it's nice to see you today. How are you feeling? Patient A: Hi, Doctor. I'm feeling okay, no major issues. Doctor: That's great to hear. I understand that you're a 45-year-old Caucasian male with no history of cancer in your family, correct? Patient A: Yes, that's correct. No one in my family has had cancer. Doctor: And you're currently asymptomatic, meaning you're not experiencing any symptoms related to cancer, right? Patient A: Yes, I don't have any symptoms or health issues. Doctor: Based on your age and history, certain guidelines recommend not to undergo PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. These guidelines are from the USPSTF, the AAFP, the NCI, the CDC, the ACS, and the AUA. Patient A: Oh, I see. So I shouldn't get screened for prostate cancer? Doctor: Well, it's not that simple. Other organizations, like the NCCN, the NCI, and the CDC, suggest discussing the risks and benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer with patients like yourself. This way, you can make an informed decision about whether or not to proceed with the screening. Patient A: Hmm, what are the risks and benefits of the screening? Doctor: The benefits of screening for prostate cancer include early detection, which can lead to better treatment outcomes. However, the risks include false positives, which may result in unnecessary treatments and potential side effects. It's important to weigh these factors in making your decision. Patient A: I see.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been dealing with left lower extremity pain for over 10 years. It has worsened significantly over the past two years, so I thought it's time to seek further medical attention. Doctor: I see. Can you describe the pain for me? Patient: It's like a throbbing and cramping sensation, and it doesn't go away even after I rest. Doctor: Alright, let's go over your past medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions? Patient: Yes, I have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and I use tobacco every day. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Were you leading an active lifestyle before the onset of the lower extremity pain? Patient: Yes, I was healthy and active before all this started. Doctor: Let's perform a physical exam. *Examines patient* Your feet are warm and pink with normal sensation and 2+ distal pulses. We'll need to do an arterial Doppler of your left lower extremity to investigate further. *After the Doppler test* Doctor: The Doppler revealed severe stenosis of your left superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery. We started you on cilostazol 100 milligrams two times per day, but your symptoms did not improve. We then performed an arteriography. Patient: What did the arteriography show? Doctor: The arteriography showed normal iliac, common femoral, and superficial femoral arteries without atherosclerosis. However, there was occlusion of your left popliteal artery and extensive collateral flow to your leg. This raised suspicion for PAES. Patient: What did you do next? Doctor: We performed a study with provocative maneuvers. Dorsiflexion and plantar extension of your ankle caused the cessation of the collateral and distal popliteal artery flow. When your ankle was returned to a neutral position, the occlusion ceased and flow was restored. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of PAES with resulting popliteal artery occlusion. Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: We performed a popliteal artery bypass with a reverse great saphenous vein. I'm happy to report that the procedure was successful and your symptoms have resolved. Patient: That's great to hear! I'm so relieved. Doctor: I'm glad we could help. It's important to monitor your condition and follow up with us regularly. Also, I'd strongly recommend quitting tobacco use as it can contribute to your medical conditions. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll definitely consider quitting and will follow up as needed. [/INST] S: The patient reports a 10-year history of left lower extremity pain, which has worsened over the past two years. The pain is described as a throbbing and cramping sensation that persists even after rest. The patient has a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and daily tobacco use. The patient was previously healthy and active. O: Physical examination shows warm, pink feet with normal sensation and 2+ distal pulses. Arterial Doppler revealed severe stenosis of the left superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery. Arteriography showed normal iliac, common femoral, and superficial femoral arteries without atherosclerosis, but occlusion of the left popliteal artery and extensive collateral flow. Provocative maneuvers during a study confirmed the diagnosis of Popliteal Artery Entrapment Syndrome (PAES) with cessation of collateral and distal popliteal artery flow on dorsiflexion and plantar extension, which was restored on returning the ankle to a neutral position. A: The primary diagnosis is Popliteal Artery Entrapment Syndrome (PAES) with resulting popliteal artery occlusion. Differential diagnoses considered included atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease, which was ruled out by arteriography. The prognosis is favorable following surgical intervention. P: The patient underwent a successful popliteal artery bypass using a reverse great saphenous vein, which resolved the symptoms. The management plan includes regular follow-up to monitor the condition. The patient is strongly advised to quit tobacco use to prevent further vascular complications. Education on lifestyle modifications and the importance of compliance with follow-up appointments was provided. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you tell me about the injury you sustained recently? Patient: Hi doctor, I had a crush injury to my left heel when it was run over by a bulldozer. Doctor: That sounds painful. I see that you had lower extremity fractures that were repaired at another hospital, and you were transferred here for reconstruction. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: We've repaired the wound using a free latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap and a split-thickness skin graft. Are you familiar with these procedures? Patient: No, not really. Doctor: The myocutaneous flap is a piece of muscle and skin taken from your back to reconstruct the damaged area. The split-thickness skin graft involves taking a thin layer of skin from another part of your body to cover the wound.  Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: You were also placed in an external fixation for a total of 6 weeks. The external fixator was modified with additional bars to keep your heel elevated, as seen in patient 1.  Patient: Yeah, I remember that. Doctor: Unfortunately, your hospital course was complicated by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection and hematoma at the injury site. Do you recall the symptoms of the infection? Patient: Yes, the area around the wound was red, swollen, and painful. Doctor: That's consistent with an infection. We had to perform an evacuation to remove the hematoma and treat the infection.  Patient: Yeah, I remember that too. Doctor: How have you been feeling since your discharge from the hospital? Patient: I've been feeling much better, thank you. Doctor: That's great to hear. The muscular flap remained viable, which means the reconstruction was successful. Please continue to keep an eye on the wound and let us know if you experience any issues.  Patient: Will do, thank you, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient reports a crush injury to the left heel sustained from being run over by a bulldozer. The patient was transferred for reconstruction after initial treatment of lower extremity fractures. The patient recalls symptoms of a MRSA infection at the injury site, including redness, swelling, and pain. O: The patient underwent reconstruction with a free latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap and a split-thickness skin graft. An external fixator was applied for 6 weeks with modifications to elevate the heel. The patient developed a MRSA infection and hematoma, necessitating evacuation. The muscular flap remains viable, indicating successful reconstruction. A: The primary diagnosis is a crush injury to the left heel with complications including MRSA infection and hematoma. The successful use of a myocutaneous flap and skin graft indicates effective surgical intervention. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the current viability of the muscular flap and resolution of infection symptoms. P: The patient is advised to continue monitoring the wound for any signs of infection or other complications. Regular follow-up appointments should be scheduled to assess healing progress. Education on signs of infection and wound care should be provided. Referral to infectious disease specialists or a wound care team may be considered if any complications arise. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing some hearing loss on my right side. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a bit more about your history with hearing loss? Patient: Well, when I was 4, I had mumps and it caused profound sensorineural hearing loss on my left side. I had an evaluation for a cochlear implant, but the promontory test was negative. Doctor: I understand. Have you experienced any changes in your hearing recently? Patient: Yes, in 2010, I developed hearing loss on my right side, and an IC VS was detected using cMRI. Doctor: It seems like you have been through a lot. What treatments have you undergone for the tumor? Patient: I had SRS in 2019 in a different hospital (3 × 6 Gy) to stop tumor progression and prevent further hearing loss. It was a pre-therapeutic PTA. Doctor: Unfortunately, it seems like your hearing loss progressed after the treatment. Patient: Yes, by August 2020, my aided WRS with a hearing aid was 0% on the right side. Doctor: I see that a recent cMRI demonstrated a stable tumor. What did you decide to do for hearing rehabilitation? Patient: I decided to have a cochlear implant on the right side to help with my hearing. Doctor: That's a good choice. It looks like the implantation was performed in our unit in November 2020 without complications. How has your hearing been since the implant? Patient: My hearing has improved a lot. Two months after the implant, my aided PTA improved remarkably, and I could understand 90% of the monosyllables at 65 dB. Doctor: That's a great improvement! It seems like your hearing has remained at that level six months after implantation. Let's check your hearing in noise now. Patient: Sure, what do I need to do? Doctor: We'll do an aided Oldenburg Sentence test (OLSA) to measure your hearing in noise. One year postoperatively, you scored a 1.5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with your unilateral CI. Patient: That sounds good. I'm glad my hearing has improved so much. Doctor: Yes, it's a significant improvement. Keep monitoring your hearing and let us know if you experience any changes or have concerns. We're here to help. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and advice. [/INST] S: The patient reports progressive hearing loss on the right side, initially noted in 2010, with a history of profound sensorineural hearing loss on the left side since age 4 due to mumps. The patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in 2019 to halt tumor progression related to an intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma (IC VS) detected via cMRI. Despite SRS, the patient experienced a decline in hearing, with an aided Word Recognition Score (WRS) of 0% by August 2020. The patient opted for cochlear implantation on the right side in November 2020, which led to significant hearing improvement. O: The patient's recent cMRI shows a stable intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma. Post-cochlear implantation, the patient's aided Pure Tone Average (PTA) improved significantly, and they could understand 90% of monosyllables at 65 dB. One year postoperatively, the patient scored a 1.5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the Oldenburg Sentence test (OLSA). A: The primary diagnosis is bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, secondary to mumps (left side) and intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma (right side). The patient's right-sided hearing loss has been effectively managed with cochlear implantation, showing significant improvement in speech recognition and hearing in noise. The stable nature of the tumor post-SRS is encouraging, though continuous monitoring is necessary. P: Continue regular auditory evaluations to monitor the function of the cochlear implant and the status of the vestibular schwannoma. Encourage the patient to report any changes in hearing or new symptoms immediately. Schedule a follow-up MRI in one year to assess tumor stability. Reinforce the importance of hearing rehabilitation exercises to maximize the benefit of the cochlear implant. Provide emotional and technical support as needed to enhance adaptation and device usage. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, you've presented to the neurosurgery clinic today with complaints of backache and left leg numbness. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, my symptoms started about three months ago. I developed pain in my lower back, and it's been getting worse ever since. The pain is continuous and has increased from moderate to severe. It's worse at night, but taking paracetamol helps a bit. I've also noticed weakness in my legs, especially on the left side. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other issues recently? Patient: Yes, a week ago, I started having trouble with urinary retention and constipation. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Based on your symptoms and our examination, we found decreased power in your lower limbs, a bilaterally positive straight leg response, and absent plantar reflexes. We decided to admit you for further workup. We performed a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of your whole spine that revealed an intramedullary lesion extending from T8 to L1 vertebrae involving the conus. The maximum dimension of the lesion was 138 mm. Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What did you do next? Doctor: We performed a decompression laminectomy to excise the space-occupying lesion. We sent the resected specimen for histopathological review, which established the diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. Patient: What happened after the surgery? Doctor: The immediate post-operative MRI of your thoracic and lumbar spine showed post-surgical changes, including hemorrhage at the site of surgery and cord edema. The MRI brain showed no metastatic disease. Unfortunately, you had reduced sensation and power in your lower limbs after the surgery, which made you bedbound. Patient: Oh no. What can be done about that? Doctor: We started physical rehabilitation, which improved your condition slightly. Now, you can be mobilized using a wheelchair. Patient: That's good to hear. What are the next steps? Doctor: We discussed your case in a site-specific multidisciplinary team meeting, and the consensus was to offer adjuvant concurrent chemo-radiation (CCRT). You will receive a total radiation dose of 4500 cGy in 25 fractions, at 180 cGy per fraction per day. Patient: Thank you for explaining everything, doctor. I appreciate your help and care during this difficult time. [/INST] S: The patient, presenting to the neurosurgery clinic, reports a three-month history of progressively worsening lower back pain, described as continuous and severe, particularly at night, partially relieved by paracetamol. The patient also experiences left-sided leg weakness, urinary retention, and constipation that started one week ago. O: Physical examination revealed decreased power in the lower limbs, bilaterally positive straight leg raise test, and absent plantar reflexes. MRI of the spine showed an intramedullary lesion from T8 to L1, measuring 138 mm. Post-operative MRI indicated hemorrhage and cord edema at the surgical site but no metastatic brain disease. Histopathology confirmed glioblastoma multiforme. A: The primary diagnosis is spinal glioblastoma multiforme with associated symptoms of severe back pain, leg weakness, urinary retention, and constipation. Differential diagnosis could include other intramedullary spinal tumors. The prognosis is guarded due to the high-grade nature of the tumor and post-operative complications including reduced sensation and mobility. P: The patient underwent decompression laminectomy for tumor excision. Post-surgery, the patient was started on a physical rehabilitation program and has shown slight improvement, now mobilizing with a wheelchair. The treatment plan includes adjuvant concurrent chemo-radiation therapy, with a total radiation dose of 4500 cGy delivered in 25 fractions. Regular follow-up in the neurosurgery clinic will be necessary to monitor progress and manage any complications. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you are a 27-year-old female patient who has presented with an abdominal lump for the past nine months. Have you experienced any other symptoms during this time? Patient: Well, there's been some fullness in my abdomen after eating food and I've lost some weight. Doctor: I see. Our clinical examination showed a large, non-tender, soft cystic swelling occupying your entire upper abdomen. We conducted some radiological investigations including an ultrasonogram, which revealed a complex cystic mass with internal septation. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of your abdomen showed a large multiseptated cystic lesion that occupies almost your entire abdomen and is adhered to your pancreas, causing a mass effect. The lesion is well defined, lobulated, and hypodense in nature. There was also dilation of the main pancreatic duct, as well as portal vein thrombosis with portal cavernoma.  Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does it all mean, doc? Doctor: We performed a USG-guided FNAC that revealed straw-colored aspirate with mature lymphocytes, but no atypical cells were noted. Your cyst amylase and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were within the normal range. This means that the lesion is not cancerous. Patient: Oh, that's a relief. So, what's next? Doctor: After a complete preoperative workup, you underwent surgical exploration. During the exploration, we found a large multiloculated cystic lesion extending through your gastrocolic omentum, which was pushing your stomach up and transverse colon downwards. There were hundreds of cystic spaces containing lymphatic fluid. Patient: What did you do about it? Doctor: We decompressed the cysts and excised the entire lesion. The anterior surface of your pancreas was forming the base of the lesion. After the surgery, you had continued lymphatic discharge, which was managed with an abdominal drain, and you were discharged with the drain in place. Patient: How did the final examination go? Doctor: The histopathological examination showed unremarkable pancreatic tissue with an attached lesion consisting of dilated lymphatic spaces with lymphatic follicles in the wall. There were congested blood vessels and fibrocollagenous tissue with chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Cytocentrifuged smears from the fluid showed lymphocytes, but no malignant or atypical cells were seen. Patient: What does that mean for me moving forward? Doctor: You were followed regularly in our outpatient department, and your drain output gradually decreased over two weeks. It was eventually removed. It's important to continue monitoring your condition, so please make sure to attend any scheduled follow-up appointments and inform us of any changes in your symptoms. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I will make sure to keep up with my appointments and let you know if anything changes.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi Doctor, I've been experiencing some swelling in my left lower leg. I have grade 3 obesity with a body mass index of 45.2 kg/m2 and type II diabetes. My hemoglobin A1c is 8.1%. Doctor: I see. When did you first notice the swelling? Patient: It started in May 2017, so I went to see my primary care physician. Doctor: And what tests were done to investigate the issue? Patient: They did a venous duplex which showed no deep venous thrombosis and an X-Ray that revealed lower extremity atherosclerosis, but no fracture. Doctor: Okay, it seems like your primary care physician referred you to a cardiologist, is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: What were the findings from the cardiologist? Patient: They did an Electrocardiogram which demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and a left bundle branch block. Echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25% without significant valvular pathology, and I was diagnosed with heart failure. Doctor: I see. Were there any other tests done to evaluate your overall health? Patient: Yes, they checked my renal, liver, and thyroid function, as well as my ferritin and potassium levels. Everything was within normal limits. I also tested non-reactive for HIV and was not anemic. Doctor: That's good to hear. What medications were you prescribed for your heart failure? Patient: I was started on a beta-blocker, an ACE inhibitor, and a statin. Doctor: How about any further tests to assess your heart condition? Patient: In June 2017, I had a Cardiac MRI which revealed a dilated cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 21%. They also did a Coronary CT angiogram which showed a calcium score of 458. Doctor: It seems like there was extensive calcification on the CT angiogram. Were they able to assess your coronary artery stenosis? Patient: No, the calcification made it difficult for them to assess the stenosis, so I had to undergo cardiac catheterization. Doctor: What were the findings from the cardiac catheterization? Patient: It showed a cardiomyopathy out of proportion to coronary artery disease with a 30% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis, a 25% proximal and a 60% distal left circumflex artery stenosis, and a 65% first obtuse marginal artery lesion. The left main and right coronary arteries were without stenosis. Doctor: I understand that must have been quite shocking for you. Did you make any lifestyle changes following your diagnosis? Patient: Yes, I was determined to adopt a healthier diet, so I changed to a whole food plant-based diet and started taking supplemental vitamin B12. Doctor: That's great. Have you seen any improvements in your health since making these changes? Patient: Yes, I lost 22.7 kg in less than 6 months, and my BMI is now 35.1 kg/m2. My diabetes resolved, with my hemoglobin A1c falling to 5.7% without needing diabetes medications. My baseline dyspnea on exertion also improved considerably. Doctor: That's fantastic news! Have you had any follow-up tests to check on your heart function? Patient: Yes, I had a repeat echocardiography in November 2017, and it showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you've presented to the University of Michigan Hospital and Health Systems Comprehensive Wound Center for ongoing care of a painful right foot fifth digit wound. Can you please tell me how this wound started? Patient: Hi, yes. I first noticed the lesion after stubbing the digit about 2 months ago. Doctor: I see. Did you consult your primary care doctor regarding this wound? Patient: Yes, I went to my primary care doctor about a month after the injury. They diagnosed it as a diabetic foot ulcer. Doctor: Has the lesion improved with local wound care since then? Patient: It improved minimally with wound care, but it didn't heal completely. Doctor: I see. During your presentation to the wound center, we noticed a granulomatous mass on the medial aspect of your right fifth digit (Fig.). We scheduled a biopsy for the lesion, but you mentioned something happened to the mass before the biopsy procedure. Can you explain? Patient: Yeah, the granulomatous mass actually sloughed off in my sock the week prior to the biopsy. It left only a small partial-thickness ulcer, and since my symptoms improved, I decided to defer the biopsy. Doctor: Alright. Have you continued regular monthly follow-up at the wound center? Patient: Yes, I have been coming for regular check-ups, and now the wound has developed into two painful papules. Doctor: Let's discuss your past medical history. Are you aware that you have type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma, and dementia? Patient: Yes, I am aware of my medical conditions. Doctor: Do you have any family history of skin lesions or cancer? Patient: No, there's no family history of skin lesions or cancer. Doctor: Are you on any immunosuppressive medication? Also, can you tell me about your smoking, alcohol, and illicit drug use habits? Patient: I don't take any immunosuppressive medications. I am a lifelong non-smoker, and I don't use alcohol or illicit drugs. Doctor: Thank you for the information. On your last recorded hemoglobin A1c test, it was 6.1%. During the clinical examination, we found that you have palpable pedal pulses with triphasic flow to the bilateral dorsalis pedis artery and posterior tibialis artery. Your right hallux toe pressure was 126 mmHg and your left hallux toe pressure was 184 mmHg. You also have diminished protective sensation, 2 out of 4 sites bilaterally, as tested with a 10-g 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament, according to the American Diabetes Association guidelines.  Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining all of that. Doctor: Based on your medical history and current wound, we will continue to provide you with the necessary care and closely monitor your condition. Please continue your regular monthly follow-ups at the wound center. Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. I will keep coming in for my check-ups. [/INST] S: The patient, a known diabetic, presented with a painful lesion on the right foot fifth digit, initially noticed 2 months ago after an injury. The primary care doctor diagnosed it as a diabetic foot ulcer. Despite local wound care, the lesion only minimally improved and did not heal completely. Recently, the lesion developed into two painful papules. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma, and dementia. There is no family history of skin lesions or cancer. The patient denies any use of immunosuppressive medications, smoking, alcohol, or illicit drugs. O: The patient's last recorded hemoglobin A1c was 6.1%. Clinical examination showed palpable pedal pulses with triphasic flow to the bilateral dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis arteries. Right hallux toe pressure was 126 mmHg, and left hallux toe pressure was 184 mmHg. Diminished protective sensation was noted, 2 out of 4 sites bilaterally, as tested with a 10-g 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament. Previously, a granulomatous mass on the medial aspect of the right fifth digit sloughed off, leaving a small partial-thickness ulcer. A: The primary diagnosis is a diabetic foot ulcer complicated by the development of painful papules and a history of a granulomatous mass. Differential diagnoses could include infection or neoplastic processes, considering the history of the granulomatous mass. The prognosis depends on continued wound care and monitoring for signs of infection or other complications. P: Continue regular monthly follow-ups at the wound center. Maintain strict glycemic control as indicated by hemoglobin A1c levels. Continue local wound care and monitor for signs of infection or other complications. Consider a biopsy of new lesions if they do not resolve with conservative management. Educate the patient on the importance of foot care and regular monitoring due to his diabetic status and history of foot ulcers. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi Doctor, I recently presented at the Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital in Puducherry, India, with a complaint of acute abdominal pain. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me take a look at your test results. It seems that you had a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan done which demonstrated the presence of bilateral ovarian mature cystic teratomas. There was also contrast enhancement within the right ovarian cyst, suggesting the possibility of malignant transformation. Did they check your tumor marker carbohydrate antigen- (CA-) 125? Patient: Yes, they did. They told me it was 27 IU/mL. Doctor: That's within the normal range, which is less than 35 IU/mL. So, they performed a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy on you, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: During the gross examination, they found that your right ovary was cystic, measuring 12 cms in diameter, and predominantly smooth except for an area of 3cm2 which had blunt pale soft projections. The left ovary appeared to be normal, measuring 3 cms in the greatest diameter. Microscopically, both ovaries showed various mature tissues including bronchial mucosa, apocrine glands, cartilage, and skin with adnexal structures.  Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: Now, the microscopy of the soft pale projections of the right ovary showed papillary structures with fibrovascular cores which were lined by transitional epithelium exhibiting nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromatism, and increased mitotic activity. There was also evidence of invasion of the ovarian stroma by nests of malignant epithelial cells. However, the inked ovarian capsular surface was free of tumor. Patient: That doesn't sound good. Doctor: The immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the urothelial carcinoma showed cytoplasmic and membrane positivity for Uroplakin II. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of ovarian cystic teratoma with primary invasive urothelial carcinoma (TNM stage pT1aNxMx) was made according to the Pathological Stage Classification by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: It means that you had a cancerous growth in your ovary, but it was removed during the surgery. You were reviewed for 3 months following the surgery, and the follow-up CECT revealed no evidence of recurrent tumor in your abdomen and pelvis. You will need to continue regular monitoring to ensure there's no recurrence of the tumor. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. I'll make sure to follow up with my doctor regularly. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. Take care and I wish you the best of health. [/INST] S: The patient, a female, reported acute abdominal pain and was previously treated at the Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital in Puducherry, India. She underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy following the diagnosis of bilateral ovarian mature cystic teratomas with suspected malignant transformation in the right ovarian cyst. She has no reported symptoms post-surgery. O: The patient's CA-125 level was 27 IU/mL, within the normal range (<35 IU/mL). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan showed bilateral ovarian mature cystic teratomas with contrast enhancement in the right ovarian cyst. Gross examination revealed a cystic right ovary measuring 12 cms with areas of blunt pale soft projections and a normal appearing left ovary measuring 3 cms. Microscopy indicated papillary structures with signs of malignancy in the right ovary, but the capsular surface was tumor-free. Immunohistochemistry confirmed primary invasive urothelial carcinoma (TNM stage pT1aNxMx). Follow-up CECT showed no evidence of recurrent tumor. A: Primary diagnosis is ovarian cystic teratoma with primary invasive urothelial carcinoma, stage pT1aNxMx. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the current absence of recurrent tumor, but ongoing vigilance for recurrence is necessary. P: The patient will continue regular monitoring with periodic CECT scans to detect any recurrence of the tumor. She should maintain follow-up appointments with her oncologist and report any new symptoms immediately. Education regarding signs of recurrence and the importance of regular monitoring will be reinforced. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand that your 7-month-old twin boy was brought to our institution's emergency department recently. Can you tell me what symptoms you've noticed? Parent: Yes, he was having increased difficulty breathing and his oxygen levels were dropping into the 70s. Doctor: I see. Your son was born at 33 weeks gestational age with Down syndrome, and he developed chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity. He was also found to have a moderate-sized secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) as a newborn. Has he been hospitalized before for similar issues? Parent: Yes, he's been in the hospital multiple times for failure to thrive and respiratory distress. He needed mechanical ventilation with a high amount of supplemental O2 and inhaled nitric oxide (iNO). Doctor: That's because he developed pulmonary hypertension (PH). Echocardiography showed progressive enlargement and hypertrophy of his right ventricle and at times, bidirectional shunting across his ASD. We performed a diagnostic cardiac catheterization as a preoperative evaluation, which showed elevated pulmonary vascular resistance indexed (PVRi) at baseline (8.8 WU·m2). It decreased with inhaled oxygen alone and iNO (3.8 WU·m2). Additional catheterization data at baseline condition showed a right atrial mean pressure of 6 mmHg, right ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 6 mmHg, and pulmonary artery pressure 51/19 mmHg with a mean of 32 mmHg. Parent: So, what was the treatment plan after that? Doctor: We started your son on home O2 therapy with a nasal cannula. His current hospitalization occurred prior to a planned fenestrated patch repair of his ASD. Parent: When he was admitted to the hospital this time, his condition got worse, right? Doctor: Yes, he was initially admitted to the general ward but soon transferred to the pediatric ICU due to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. We diagnosed him with a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection based on the positive antigen test. Parent: And how did you manage his condition after that? Doctor: He continued to have paroxysmal severe hypoxic events compatible with PH crisis. We treated him with sedation and neuromuscular paralysis, increased FiO2, optimization of O2 carrying capacity with packed red blood cells transfusions, and iNO. We also added Milrinone infusion as his right ventricular function was depressed on echocardiogram (TAPSE 6 mm, Z-score -4), which demonstrated evidence of systemic to suprasystemic right ventricular pressure and bidirectional shunting across the ASD. Parent: I see. Is there anything else we should be aware of or do for him? Doctor: It's important to continue monitoring his condition closely, and we'll work together to manage his pulmonary hypertension and other complications. We'll also go ahead with the planned fenestrated patch repair of his ASD when his condition stabilizes. Please reach out to us if you have any concerns or if his symptoms worsen. [/INST] S: The patient, a 7-month-old male twin with Down syndrome and chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity, presented with increased difficulty breathing and oxygen saturation dropping into the 70s. He has a history of multiple hospitalizations for failure to thrive and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen. He was born at 33 weeks gestational age and has a moderate-sized secundum atrial septal defect (ASD). The parent reports previous treatments including inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) and home oxygen therapy. O: On examination, the patient was admitted to the pediatric ICU from the general ward due to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation. Diagnostic tests confirmed a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Cardiac catheterization showed elevated pulmonary vascular resistance indexed (PVRi) at 8.8 WU·m2, which decreased to 3.8 WU·m2 with inhaled oxygen and iNO. Echocardiography indicated right ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction (TAPSE 6 mm, Z-score -4), with systemic to suprasystemic right ventricular pressures and bidirectional shunting across the ASD. A: The primary diagnosis is severe hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to RSV infection, in the context of underlying pulmonary hypertension (PH) and chronic lung disease due to prematurity. The patient also has a moderate-sized secundum ASD contributing to his condition. Differential diagnoses include PH crisis and complications related to his congenital heart disease and prematurity. P: The management plan includes continued mechanical ventilation, sedation, and neuromuscular paralysis to manage the PH crisis. Optimization of oxygen carrying capacity with packed red blood cells transfusions and increased FiO2. Ongoing iNO therapy and initiation of Milrinone infusion to support right ventricular function. Close monitoring in the pediatric ICU is necessary, with plans to proceed with fenestrated patch repair of the ASD once the patient's condition stabilizes. The family should maintain regular communication with the healthcare team for any changes in symptoms or concerns. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I heard you've been experiencing progressive lower urinary tract symptoms for the past five months. You were referred to our service for evaluation of prostatic enlargement. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, I had trouble urinating, and it's been getting worse. I've been using an indwelling bladder catheter to help me pee. Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any respiratory symptoms or have any known epidemiological history? Patient: No, I haven't had any respiratory issues, and I don't know of any epidemiological history. Doctor: Alright. We've performed several tests, including a PSA test, which showed a level of 6.54ng/mL, and a digital rectal examination, which indicated your prostate is diffusely enlarged without focal nodulations. To further investigate, we conducted a multiparametric MRI. Patient: Hmm, what did the MRI results show? Doctor: The multiparametric MRI demonstrated that your prostate is enlarged and has increased vascularization on the perfusion map. We also identified a small nodule of abnormal diffusion restriction in the left posterior mid-third of the transition zone, with intense peripheral post-contrast enhancement and a liquefied center, which is suggestive of a microabscess. Patient: That doesn't sound good. What does it mean? Doctor: It's a focal lesion, but the final PI-RADS score is 2, which is used to predict the risk of malignancy on multiparametric MRI. This indicates a low probability of a significant prostatic neoplasia, which is a positive sign. However, due to your PSA levels, we performed an ultrasound-guided biopsy, including a targeted biopsy on the area described in the MRI. Patient: Okay, what did the biopsy results show? Doctor: The histopathological analysis of the fragments from the targeted area, which was suggestive of an abscess, showed a chronic granulomatous inflammatory process. We also conducted a specific test for acid-alcohol resistant bacilli (BAAR), which confirmed a mycobacterial etiology. Patient: So, what does this all mean for me, doc? Doctor: It means that the lesion in your prostate is not likely to be malignant or a significant neoplasia. However, the presence of a mycobacterial infection requires treatment to address the inflammation and the microabscess. We'll discuss potential treatment options and closely monitor your condition. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. I appreciate it. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll work together to address your condition and help alleviate your symptoms. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. [/INST] S: The patient reports progressive lower urinary tract symptoms over the past five months, including difficulty urinating, which has worsened over time. He has been using an indwelling bladder catheter for urinary assistance. He denies any respiratory symptoms or known epidemiological history. O: Physical examination and diagnostic tests reveal a PSA level of 6.54 ng/mL (normal range: 0-4 ng/mL), indicating elevated levels. Digital rectal examination shows diffuse enlargement of the prostate without focal nodulations. Multiparametric MRI of the prostate reveals an enlarged prostate with increased vascularization and a small nodule in the left posterior mid-third of the transition zone, suggestive of a microabscess. The lesion has a PI-RADS score of 2, indicating low probability of significant prostatic neoplasia. Ultrasound-guided biopsy and histopathological analysis confirm a chronic granulomatous inflammatory process with a mycobacterial etiology. A: The primary diagnosis is chronic granulomatous prostatitis with mycobacterial infection, presenting as a microabscess in the prostate. The differential diagnosis initially included significant prostatic neoplasia, which was ruled out based on the PI-RADS score and biopsy results. The elevated PSA levels and symptoms of urinary obstruction were initially concerning for malignancy but are now attributed to the inflammatory process. P: The management plan includes initiating appropriate antimycobacterial therapy to address the mycobacterial infection. Continued monitoring of PSA levels and symptoms will be necessary to assess the response to treatment and adjust as needed. The patient will be educated on the nature of his condition, the importance of adherence to the prescribed therapy, and the need for regular follow-up appointments. Referral to a urologist for ongoing management of lower urinary tract symptoms and prostatic health is recommended. The patient is encouraged to contact healthcare providers if symptoms persist or worsen. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you've been experiencing intermittent headaches. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've been having these headaches on and off for a while now. They just come and go randomly. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. We performed an MRI and a CT scan, and it appears there's a space-occupying lesion at your sella turcica, measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.3 cm (Fig. A, B). Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does that mean? Doctor: This lesion is actually a pituitary macroadenoma, which is a type of tumor. It's the likely cause of your headaches and your acromegaly. Patient: Acromegaly? What's that? Doctor: Acromegaly is a condition where the body produces too much growth hormone. We conducted preoperative endocrine examinations and found that your growth hormone levels are elevated.  Patient: So, what's the treatment for this? Doctor: The best course of action is to undergo endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery to remove the tumor. We employed 3D-printing technology to reconstruct a model of your tumor (Fig. C, D). Patient: Wow, that's interesting. What's the purpose of the 3D model? Doctor: We used the model to actively communicate your condition with your relatives, which led to good communication results. It also helped us plan the surgical approach and practice the surgical manipulation, providing important guidance for the surgery. Patient: That's really helpful. So, how did the surgery go? Doctor: The surgery went well, and we were able to achieve a full tumor resection. The pathological examination confirmed that the tumor was a growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma. Patient: That's great to hear. Were there any complications after the surgery? Doctor: No complications occurred after the surgery, and you're on track for a successful recovery. We'll continue to monitor your progress as you prepare to be discharged. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate all the care and attention you've given me throughout this process. [/INST] S: The patient reports experiencing intermittent headaches, which occur randomly. The patient was unaware of the underlying cause until diagnosed. O: MRI and CT scans revealed a space-occupying lesion in the sella turcica, measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.3 cm. Preoperative endocrine examinations showed elevated growth hormone levels. The patient underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery, during which a 3D-printed model of the tumor was used for surgical planning and practice. Postoperative pathological examination confirmed the lesion as a growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma. No complications were reported post-surgery. A: The primary diagnosis is a growth hormone-secreting pituitary macroadenoma, which has been fully resected. This diagnosis explains the patient's symptoms of intermittent headaches and the clinical finding of acromegaly. The prognosis is favorable given the successful tumor resection and absence of surgical complications. P: The patient will continue to be monitored post-discharge to ensure recovery and to manage any potential recurrence of the tumor or related hormonal imbalances. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess endocrine function and MRI scans will be conducted to check for any regrowth of the adenoma. Education on symptoms of hormonal imbalances and when to seek medical advice will be provided to the patient. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello! How can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doc. I've been diagnosed with yellow nail syndrome in 2000, and I've had a long history of sinusitis since 1983. I've also developed respiratory tract infections since 1996. Doctor: I see. Have you had any other issues related to your condition? Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with primary lower limb lymphoedema in 2000 as well. After that, I started having recurrent effusions, initially on the right side. Doctor: Have you had any procedures or tests done for the effusions? Patient: I've had repeat thoracocenteses, which showed cloudy, thick fluid that was exudative in nature. I also had a right video-assisted thoracoscopic pleural biopsy. Doctor: What were the results of the pleural biopsy? Patient: The biopsy showed chronic inflammation and reactive mesothelial changes, but no malignancy. Doctor: Okay, that's good to know. Did you notice any changes in your nails around the time of your yellow nail syndrome diagnosis? Patient: Yes, I developed xanthonychia in 2000, which led to the diagnosis of yellow nail syndrome. Doctor: I understand. Have you experienced any other complications with your condition? Patient: My condition continued to worsen, and I developed bronchiectasis in 2003. I've had recurrent chest infections and bilateral effusions since then. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Can you tell me more about your personal history, like your occupation and smoking habits? Patient: I have a history of heavy prior tobacco smoking. I've worked as a general manager, policeman, clothing design director, and dark room technician. Doctor: I see. Unfortunately, the patient passed away in 2010 following an infective exacerbation of his bronchiectasis. A CT scan performed shortly before his death showed extensive right pleuroparenchymal disease, including right diffuse pleural thickening, bronchiectasis, and right airspace shadowing. Doctor (to the patient's family): I'm sorry for your loss. We performed a postmortem examination to better understand the patient's condition. The external examination revealed yellow discolouration affecting the finger- and toenails, along with bilateral lower leg oedema. Examination of the respiratory system showed extensive bilateral pleural adhesions, diffuse visceral pleural thickening, and parietal pleural plaques. Doctor (to the patient's family): Microscopically, we confirmed the presence of paucicellular hyaline collagenous plaques with a 'basket-weave' pattern, bilateral diffuse pleural fibrosis composed of similarly paucicellular collagen, and occasional lymphoid aggregates. Septal lymphatics were noted to be markedly dilated. A right-sided lobar pneumonia with organization was present as well. Doctor (to the patient's family): Upon careful inspection of multiple lung sections by light microscopy, we could not detect any asbestos body formation. There was a talc pleurodesis reaction in the right pleural space. Within the lung tissue bilaterally, remote from the pleura, platy form polarisable material was seen, consistent with talc. [/INST] S: The patient, diagnosed with yellow nail syndrome in 2000, reported a long-standing history of sinusitis since 1983 and recurrent respiratory tract infections beginning in 1996. He also developed primary lower limb lymphoedema and recurrent effusions, initially on the right side, in 2000. The patient noted the onset of xanthonychia in 2000, which led to the diagnosis of yellow nail syndrome. He experienced worsening conditions, developing bronchiectasis in 2003, with recurrent chest infections and bilateral effusions. The patient had a history of heavy tobacco smoking and diverse occupational exposures. He passed away in 2010 following an infective exacerbation of his bronchiectasis. O: The patient underwent multiple thoracocenteses, revealing exudative, cloudy, thick fluid. A right video-assisted thoracoscopic pleural biopsy indicated chronic inflammation and reactive mesothelial changes without malignancy. A CT scan before his death showed extensive right pleuroparenchymal disease, including diffuse pleural thickening, bronchiectasis, and right airspace shadowing.

Microscopic findings included paucicellular hyaline collagenous plaques, bilateral diffuse pleural fibrosis, markedly dilated septal lymphatics, right-sided lobar pneumonia with organization, and talc pleurodesis reaction in the right pleural space. A: The primary diagnosis was yellow nail syndrome, complicated by chronic sinusitis, primary lower limb lymphoedema, recurrent pleural effusions, and bronchiectasis. Differential diagnoses considered included malignancy, which was ruled out by biopsy. The patient's condition was further complicated by occupational exposures and a significant smoking history, contributing to his respiratory issues. P: Management included repeated thoracocenteses and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The patient was likely managed with antibiotics for respiratory infections and possibly diuretics for lymphoedema. Smoking cessation would have been strongly advised. Given the patient's death, ongoing management focuses on family counseling and genetic counseling for at-risk family members due to the genetic components potentially involved in his complex medical history. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, welcome to the Ear Nose Throat Outpatient Department. How can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I have this swelling in my neck on the right side, just below my lower jaw. It's been there for about a month now. Doctor: I see. Was the swelling sudden or gradual in onset? Patient: It started slowly and has been gradually getting bigger. Doctor: Have you experienced any fever, pain over the swelling, or changes in its size during meals? Patient: No, none of those. Doctor: Alright. I understand that you have a history of coronary artery disease and are using a pacemaker, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Let's proceed with an examination. I'm noticing a single 4x2.5 cm swelling in your neck below the right lower margin of the mandible. On palpation, it appears to be a nontender, firm to hard mobile mass with no local rise in temperature. The surface is smooth, and the skin over the swelling is pinchable.  Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: I would like to perform an ultrasound to get a better understanding of the swelling. The ultrasound shows an irregular heterogeneous hypoechoic lesion in the right submandibular space, measuring 37x23 mm with mild internal vascularity. The submandibular gland appears separate but compressed. There are also a few small subcentimeter-sized nodes in various locations that are likely reactive. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We performed a fine needle aspiration to further investigate the swelling, and it was suggestive of a spindle cell neoplasm. Your lab parameters are within normal limits.  Patient: So, what's the next step, Doctor? Doctor: We will need to excise the swelling under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, we identified a 3.5x2.5 cm mobile swelling in the right submandibular space, separate from the submandibular gland and suspected to be arising from a thin nerve lateral to mylohyoid. Patient: Were there any lymph nodes involved? Doctor: No, we didn't find any lymph nodes during the procedure. The specimen was removed in toto and sent for histopathological examination. Grossly, it was an unencapsulated lesion covered by adipose tissue. Patient: What did the Microscopy show? Doctor: The Microscopy showed fascicles of spindle cells. We will continue to monitor your condition and schedule follow-up appointments as needed. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.

Patient: I've been experiencing abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever recently. Doctor: I see. Upon admission, I noticed that you're alert but tachypneic and experiencing diffuse abdominal pain. We'll need to do an abdominal ultrasound to get a better understanding of what's going on.  (patient undergoes abdominal ultrasound) Doctor: The abdominal ultrasound shows that your gallbladder has multiple gallstones. We also have your complete laboratory results. It seems you have leukocytosis, acute kidney failure, and severe metabolic acidosis. Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, in this context, we have admitted you to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis. We also noticed the presence of metabolic acidosis with a gap of 32, so we requested a ketonemia test. Patient: What were the results of the ketonemia test? Doctor: The ketonemia test came back positive, so you have been diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. Patient: What does that mean for my treatment? Doctor: We will start you on a continuous insulin infusion pump and administer water to help with the diabetic ketoacidosis. We'll closely monitor your progress in the ICU. Patient: How long will I need to stay in the hospital? Doctor: After 5 days of treatment, if everything goes well, you will be discharged from the hospital. Patient: Thank you for explaining everything and taking care of me, Doctor.

P: The patient has been admitted to the ICU for intensive management. Treatment includes a continuous insulin infusion pump and hydration therapy to manage diabetic ketoacidosis. Monitoring will include regular checks of blood glucose, ketone levels, kidney function, and acid-base balance. The patient will be educated on the signs of infection and the importance of strict glycemic control. Discharge is planned for 5 days post-admission, contingent on clinical improvement and stabilization of metabolic parameters. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 51-year-old African American male veteran and you've been referred to me for pain management. It seems you have been experiencing low back pain with radiculopathy. Can you tell me more about your pain and symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've had low back pain and lower extremity pain for about three and a half years now. It's been really tough. Doctor: I understand. I see from your history that you've tried various treatments like naproxen, arch supports, proper lifting education, and physical therapy. Have these treatments provided any relief? Patient: They helped a little bit, but the pain still persists. Doctor: Your radiographs demonstrated minimal spondylosis at the L4 and L5 vertebral bodies and a MRI showed a mild posterior central disc herniation at L5-S1. Your medical history also includes hip pain, plantar fasciitis, obesity, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. You're currently on several medications, such as meloxicam, terazosin HCL, ibuprofen, bisacodyl, cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol, tramadol HCL, acetaminophen/hydrocodone, omeprazole, and ketorolac tromethamine.  Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: I also noticed that you have no history of anabolic or corticosteroid use, or Cushing's disease. Your BMI at the time of treatment was 34. Given your condition, I'd like to recommend a lumbar epidural steroid injection (LESI) to help alleviate your low back pain. Patient: Okay, is it a one-time treatment or a series of injections? Doctor: Over a five-week period, you'll receive a series of three interlaminar L4–5 LESI. You should experience short-term relief with each injection. Patient: Alright, and what happens after the injections? Doctor: Three months after the final injection, you'll be referred for a neurosurgery consult. Your neurological exam will be fully intact, and a repeat MRI will be ordered. The MRI will reveal degenerative changes of the lumbar spine, with epidural lipomatosis at lower lumbar levels, resulting in severe central canal stenosis at L4–5 and L5-S1, and varying degrees of neural foraminal narrowing. The dural sac diameter/epidural fat diameter will be 1.07, and the epidural fat/spinal canal diameter will be 48.3%, categorizing you as a grade I. Patient: I see. Is there anything I can do to prevent further issues with my back? Doctor: Maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in physical therapy, and following proper lifting techniques can help alleviate some of the strain on your back. It's important to stay proactive with your treatment and follow up with your healthcare providers. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything. I'll try my best to follow your recommendations. Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you manage your pain and improve your quality of life.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I have your medical report here. It says you are a 51-year-old man with poorly differentiated tonsillar carcinoma. We found a well-defined enhancing hypodense mass in your left tonsillar fossa, measuring 36x29x58 mms with neck nodes on the CT scan. Can you tell me if you've experienced any symptoms related to this? Patient: To be honest, I didn't notice anything unusual. Doctor: I see. The biopsy from your neck nodes showed metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma. We treated you with radiotherapy using the Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) technique, administering 7000 cGy in 35 fractions. Concurrently, we gave you weekly Cisplatin intravenously in the dose of 40 mg per square meter body surface area. How have you been feeling since the treatment? Patient: I've been feeling okay, no major problems. Doctor: That's good to hear. We conducted a post-treatment PET/CT scan 1 hour after intravenous administration of 6.8 mCi 18F-FDG on a 6-hour fasting state. The images were acquired using a 16-slice time of flight biograph horizon scanner from Siemens. The results showed that your left tonsillar fossa, base of the tongue, and lateral oropharyngeal wall were free of FDG avid lesions or cervical nodes, suggesting a response to treatment. Patient: That's a relief! Doctor: However, the axial CT images showed a 'polka dot' appearance in your 12th thoracic vertebra, which is suggestive of hemangioma. The lesion had an intense FDG uptake with an SUV max of 13.44, raising suspicion of metastasis. But you said you were asymptomatic, right? Patient: Yes, I haven't felt any pain or discomfort there. Doctor: To get a clearer picture, we performed a whole-body bone scan on another day, 3 hours after the intravenous injection of 20 mCi of Tc-99m-MDP (Methylene Diphosphonate). The scan was done using a single-head E-cam gamma camera (Siemens) equipped with a low-energy high-resolution collimator. The images did not reveal any osteoblastic lesions. Patient: So, what does that mean? Doctor: It means that there's no clear evidence of metastasis in your bones, which is a good sign. However, we'll continue to monitor your condition closely to make sure everything stays under control. Patient: I appreciate that, thank you. Doctor: You're welcome. Make sure to attend all your follow-up appointments, and if you notice any new symptoms or discomfort, please let us know immediately. Patient: I will, thank you for your help, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome, and take care. [/INST] S: The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of poorly differentiated tonsillar carcinoma. He reports being asymptomatic despite the diagnosis and treatment. He has undergone radiotherapy and chemotherapy with no major problems reported post-treatment. O: Physical examination was not detailed. Diagnostic findings include a well-defined enhancing hypodense mass in the left tonsillar fossa, measuring 36x29x58 mm with neck nodes identified on CT scan. Biopsy confirmed metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma. Post-treatment PET/CT scan showed no FDG avid lesions in the left tonsillar fossa, base of the tongue, and lateral oropharyngeal wall. However, a 'polka dot' appearance in the 12th thoracic vertebra with an SUV max of 13.44 on PET/CT raised suspicion of metastasis, though subsequent whole-body bone scan did not reveal any osteoblastic lesions. A: Primary diagnosis of poorly differentiated tonsillar carcinoma with neck node metastasis. The differential diagnosis includes potential metastasis to the 12th thoracic vertebra, although current imaging is inconclusive for bone metastasis. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the response to initial treatment, but requires close monitoring due to the complexity and aggressive nature of the carcinoma. P: Continue close monitoring with regular follow-up appointments to assess for any new symptoms or changes in condition. Patient is advised to report any new symptoms or discomfort immediately. Further imaging and diagnostic evaluations may be necessary if new symptoms arise or if there are changes in the current findings. Maintain current treatment regimen and supportive care to manage side effects and overall health. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you have a history of adjustment disorder and have been treated for anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified. What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, I've had painful, cracked, and peeling lips for about two months. They haven't improved with acyclovir or valacyclovir. Doctor: Okay, let's have a look. During the examination, I noticed thick, yellow keratinaceous crusting on your upper and lower lips, sparing the mucosal lip and vermilion border. There's also edema, erosion, and tenderness to palpation. Can you tell me if you've experienced any plaque or physical discomfort? Patient: Yes, it's really uncomfortable, and even minimal contact with the crusted area causes complete sloughing. Doctor: I see. We performed a histopathological evaluation, taking a 4 mm punch biopsy from your left lower lip. The results showed chronic lymphocytic mucositis with spongiosis. We also did some staining using Grocott's methenamine silver and periodic acid-Schiff methods, and Treponemal/Fite stains, but they all came back negative for fungal and bacterial organisms. In-situ hybridization for human papillomavirus testing was negative as well. Patient: So, what does that mean? Doctor: While the biopsy findings were not specific, the pattern of spongiotic mucositis along with your clinical features suggest that you may have irritant contact dermatitis. After further investigation, we found that your repeated self-injurious behaviors to your lips may be the cause of factitial cheilitis. Patient: Oh, I see. What can we do about it? Doctor: We'll treat the secondary impetiginization with anti-staphylococcal antibiotics and a topical antibiotic ointment for two weeks. It's important to avoid licking your lips during this time. Since you have a history of anxiety, I'll also refer you back to your behavioral health specialist for management. Patient: I was treated for anxiety before, but I stopped going to the appointments before coming to your clinic. Doctor: It's crucial to continue your treatment for anxiety, as it may be contributing to your lip condition. Remember, your mental health is just as important as your physical health. Patient: Alright, I'll make sure to follow up with my behavioral health specialist. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. And remember to use the prescribed antibiotics and ointment as directed, and try to avoid any self-injurious behaviors. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to contact us. Take care! [/INST] S: Patient reports painful, cracked, and peeling lips for two months, unresponsive to acyclovir or valacyclovir. Describes discomfort and complete sloughing with minimal contact.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I noticed in your history that you had a ruptured Acom aneurysm that was treated with balloon-assisted coiling. How have you been feeling since then? Patient: Well, recently I've been having worsening headaches, and they're really bothering me. Doctor: I see. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms, such as intermittent residual right-sided weakness? Patient: Yes, actually. I've had some weakness on my right side since my initial subarachnoid hemorrhage. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. It's important for us to know all your symptoms. Now, I see that you're currently taking aspirin and clopidogrel as your home medications, is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. Doctor: We found a new Acom aneurysm during your three-year follow-up. We discussed both surgical and non-surgical options with you, including observation. You chose to have endovascular treatment, correct? Patient: Yes, I decided to go with the endovascular treatment. Doctor: Great. So, you were brought to the neurosurgical operative suite and placed in the supine position on the operating table. Your legs were prepped and draped in sterile fashion. We catheterized your left common carotid and left ICA, and then injected contrast to perform a rotational digitally subtracted angiogram (DSA). Patient: Okay, what did you find? Doctor: The DSA revealed a wide-necked Acom aneurysm, which made you a suitable candidate for stent-assisted coil embolization. We swapped out the diagnostic catheter for a guiding catheter and advanced a Headway® microcatheter into your right A2. Patient: What happened next? Doctor: We attempted to place a 2 mm x 3 mm coil, but it kept prolapsing into the parent artery. So, we placed a 2.5 mm x 23 mm LVIS® Jr. stent into your right anterior cerebral artery, extending into your left A1. We tried coil placement again, but it kept herniating into your left A2. Patient: So, what did you do? Doctor: We reinserted the Headway® microcatheter into the guiding catheter and advanced it into your left A2. Then, we placed a second 2.5 mm x 23 mm LVIS® Jr. stent. Patient: I see. Is the procedure over now? Doctor: Yes, the procedure has been completed. You will need to have regular follow-up appointments to monitor your progress and ensure the aneurysm remains stable. We will also continue to manage your headaches and right-sided weakness as needed. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate all your efforts to help me. [/INST] S: The patient reports worsening headaches and intermittent residual right-sided weakness following a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage and a previously treated ruptured Acom aneurysm. The patient is currently on aspirin and clopidogrel. O: During a three-year follow-up, imaging revealed a new wide-necked Acom aneurysm. A rotational digitally subtracted angiogram (DSA) was performed, confirming the aneurysm's morphology suitable for stent-assisted coil embolization. The procedure involved placement of two LVIS® Jr. stents and attempts at coil placement, which were complicated by coil prolapse and herniation. A: The primary diagnosis is a recurrent Acom aneurysm, treated with stent-assisted coil embolization. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of headaches and neurological deficits, such as cerebral vasospasm or recurrent hemorrhage. The prognosis depends on the stability of the aneurysm post-procedure and management of neurological symptoms. P: The patient will continue on aspirin and clopidogrel and will require regular follow-up appointments to monitor the aneurysm's stability and assess for any complications from the procedure. Management of headaches and right-sided weakness will continue as needed, with adjustments based on symptomatology and follow-up findings. Further education on signs of neurological deterioration and when to seek immediate care will be provided. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see from your history that you've been smoking a pack a day and drinking alcohol regularly for over 20 years. Can you tell me about your respiratory and abdominal symptoms? Patient: Yeah, I've had multiple episodes of mild upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis almost every year since my early twenties. I also experienced abdominal discomfort and nausea that would come and go sporadically. Doctor: I understand. We performed a high-resolution computed tomography of your chest, and it confirmed emphysematous changes in your lungs. Additionally, your liver enzymes have been slowly trending up. Over the span of a few months, your aspartate transaminase (AST) level increased from 52 units per liter (U/L) to 58 U/L, and your alanine transaminase (ALT) level increased from 81 U/L to 86 U/L. The upper limit of normal for both AST and ALT levels fall in the low 40s U/L. Other markers of liver damage, such as serum prothrombin concentrations and serum albumin, were not affected. Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: Your primary care physician instructed you to quit smoking and drinking, eat healthily, and exercise regularly. How have you been doing with those lifestyle changes? Patient: I've been successful in making those changes, but my liver enzymes remained elevated and my lungs still showed persistent emphysema. Doctor: I see. There has been little to no improvement in your overall symptoms due to these abnormal findings. We tested you for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and found that you are homozygous for the Z allele (PI*ZZ). Your alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) level is 18, which is well below the protective threshold of 57. Patient: So, what's the plan now, doc? Doctor: We have started you on weekly Prolastin infusions to help with your condition. You have completed eight infusions so far and will continue to receive them for as long as you're able to tolerate them. Patient: Okay, I hope these infusions help improve my condition. Thanks for explaining everything to me, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, a long-term smoker and alcohol consumer, reports recurrent mild upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis annually since his early twenties, along with sporadic abdominal discomfort and nausea. Despite making recommended lifestyle changes, including cessation of smoking and alcohol consumption, there has been little improvement in his symptoms. O: High-resolution computed tomography of the chest confirmed emphysematous changes. Liver function tests showed elevated enzymes with AST rising from 52 U/L to 58 U/L and ALT from 81 U/L to 86 U/L, both above the normal upper limit of low 40s U/L. Other liver markers were normal. The patient tested positive for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), being homozygous for the Z allele (PI*ZZ) with an AAT level of 18, below the protective threshold of 57. A: The primary diagnosis is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) with associated emphysema and liver enzyme elevation, likely exacerbated by long-term smoking and alcohol use. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of chronic liver disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but these are less likely given the genetic findings and imaging results. P: The patient has been started on weekly Prolastin infusions to manage AATD and will continue as long as tolerated. Ongoing monitoring of liver enzymes and lung function is recommended. The patient should maintain cessation of smoking and alcohol, adhere to a healthy diet, and engage in regular exercise. Referral to a pulmonologist for specialized care of emphysema and a hepatologist for liver health management is advised. Further education on the implications of AATD and the importance of compliance with treatment and lifestyle modifications is necessary. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see that you were hospitalized in July 2012. Can you tell me more about the symptoms you experienced at that time? Patient: Yes, I had edema in my left lower extremities and a painful inguinal mass for about 6 months. Doctor: I see. Upon your physical examination, we found matted bilateral inguinal lymph nodes up to 9 cm in size with hard consistency, erythema, and tenderness without fluctuation or ulcer. We also noticed marked swelling at both lower extremities. There was no other superficial lymphadenopathy, and your other physical examinations were normal. Patient: Hmm, okay. Doctor: We performed an incisional biopsy of the left inguinal lymph node, which revealed a metastatic round cell tumor. The immunohistochemistry was positive for vimentin, S100, and HMB-45. The immunophenotype is consistent with malignant melanoma. Patient: Oh no, that's not good. Doctor: We suspected primary tumors in the lower extremities, abdominal cavity, and anogenital organ. We conducted a complete skin examination, ophthalmoscopy, gastroscopy, colonoscopy, and cystoscopy, but no cutaneous lesion was identified. Your genital and pelvic examinations also did not show any evidence of a lesion. Patient: So you couldn't find the primary source? Doctor: That's correct. You were diagnosed with metastatic melanoma of unknown primary. A CT scan of your abdomen showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes throughout the abdominal and pelvic cavity up to 9.5 cm, along with compression of both iliac veins without an organ-specific lesion. Your CT chest was unremarkable. Patient: I remember having a lot of pain during that time. Doctor: Yes, you developed severe pain requiring high-dose opioid treatment. You then underwent 20 Gy of palliative radiotherapy for bilateral inguinal lymph nodes. Despite the radiotherapy, the remaining tumors were up to 7.4 cm based on the CT scan. Patient: What about further treatment? Doctor: Unfortunately, due to your reimbursement issue and national policy, you couldn't access an immune checkpoint inhibitor or targeted drug. Instead, chemotherapy was prescribed with carboplatin (AUC5) and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 for 6 cycles. Patient: Did the chemotherapy help? Doctor: After completing the planned chemotherapy, your symptom was slightly improved. The CT scan at the first 3 months showed a response to the treatment. So, we will continue to monitor your condition and provide appropriate follow-up care. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all the help. [/INST] S: The patient reported experiencing edema in the left lower extremities and a painful inguinal mass for about 6 months prior to hospitalization in July 2012. The patient also mentioned severe pain during the course of the disease. O: Physical examination revealed matted bilateral inguinal lymph nodes up to 9 cm in size with hard consistency, erythema, and tenderness, and marked swelling in both lower extremities. An incisional biopsy of the left inguinal lymph node indicated a metastatic round cell tumor, with immunohistochemistry positive for vimentin, S100, and HMB-45, consistent with malignant melanoma. CT scans showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the abdominal and pelvic cavity up to 9.5 cm, with compression of both iliac veins, and an unremarkable chest CT. Post-chemotherapy CT scans showed some response to treatment. A: The primary diagnosis is metastatic melanoma of unknown primary origin. Differential diagnoses were considered but no primary tumors were found in the lower extremities, abdominal cavity, or anogenital organ despite extensive investigations. P: The patient underwent palliative radiotherapy (20 Gy) for bilateral inguinal lymph nodes and was prescribed chemotherapy with carboplatin (AUC5) and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 for 6 cycles, which led to slight improvement. Due to reimbursement issues and national policy, access to immune checkpoint inhibitors or targeted drugs was not possible. The plan includes continued monitoring and follow-up care to assess the response to chemotherapy and manage symptoms. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I see that you were referred for an assessment of nephrotic range proteinuria. Can you tell me if you've experienced any symptoms like ankle oedema recently? Patient: Yeah, I've noticed occasional ankle swelling over the past year, but I've felt pretty good otherwise. Doctor: I understand. Your past medical history shows that you were treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus in 2007, and you had a significant weight loss of 15 kg. It's great to see your glycosylated haemoglobin has been below 6% since 2013. Have you had any symptoms of macrovascular or microvascular complications? Patient: No, I haven't noticed any symptoms like that. Doctor: That's good to hear. I also see that you were diagnosed with hypertension more than 10 years ago, and you have a history of obesity with a body mass index of 47.6 g/m2. You also have degenerative spine disease. Your current medications are irbesartan 300 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, tramadol 50 mg three times a day, and meloxicam 7.5 mg as needed. There's also a family history of type 1 diabetes mellitus in your father and paternal uncle, correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Upon examination, your blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg, and your heart sounds were dual with no murmurs. There was bipedal oedema up to the bottom third of your shins, but your jugular venous pressure was not elevated, and your chest was clear to auscultation. Initial laboratory investigation demonstrated haemoglobin at 149 g/L, white cell count at 7.20 × 109/L, platelets at 235 × 109/L, blood urea nitrogen at 6.0 mmol/L, serum creatinine at 70 μmol/L, and serum albumin at 32 g/L. Your serum electrolytes, liver enzymes, calcium, and phosphate levels are within the normal range. Patient: Okay, that's good to know. Doctor: Repeated urinalysis did not demonstrate any haematuria, leukocyturia, or casts. Your urine protein creatinine ratio was 662 mg/mmol, which is abnormal compared to your normal result in August 2012. We also checked your serum levels of antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, immunoglobulin A, cryoglobulins, complement factor C3, and C4, which were all normal. Human immunodeficiency virus screen, Hepatitis B antigen, and hepatitis C antibodies were negative. Patient: So what does all that mean? Doctor: Your results indicate that you have nephrotic range proteinuria, which means there is an abnormal amount of protein in your urine. This could be related to your history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. We will continue to monitor your kidney function and adjust your medications if necessary. It's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and manage your blood pressure and blood sugar levels to prevent further complications. Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything, doctor. I will make sure to follow your advice. [/INST] S: The patient reports occasional ankle swelling over the past year but otherwise feels good. He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed in 2007, well-controlled with a glycosylated hemoglobin below 6% since 2013, and no symptoms of macrovascular or microvascular complications. He also has a history of hypertension, obesity with a BMI of 47.6 g/m2, and degenerative spine disease. Family history includes type 1 diabetes mellitus in his father and paternal uncle. O: Physical examination shows blood pressure at 140/80 mmHg, heart sounds dual with no murmurs, and bipedal edema up to the bottom third of the shins.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing pain and a decreased range of motion in both my hips. It's been affecting my daily activities. Doctor: I see. Let me take a look at your radiographies. Hmm, it seems like you have bilateral osteoarthritis of the hip, secondary to developmental hip dysplasia. Have you had any surgeries for this issue before? Patient: Yes, I underwent bilateral total hip arthroplasty. They performed a trochanteric osteotomy on my right hip and used a stainless steel cable system for fixation. Doctor: Okay, and how has your recovery been since the surgery? Patient: I was pain-free for 4 years, but last month I started feeling pain and tenderness in my right inguinal area. Doctor: Were there any immobile, painful prominences when you touched the area? Patient: Yes, there is a painful prominence by palpation. Doctor: Is the pain related to weight bearing or any particular movements? Patient: No, it's not related to weight bearing. Doctor: Alright, let me examine your hip. It seems that there's no pathology detected in the hip examination. However, upon looking at your recent radiographies, I found that the trochanteric cable in your right hip is broken and about 5 cm of the cable has migrated medially. Patient: Oh, that's concerning. My last radiography was 2 years ago, and everything looked fine then. I haven't been back for a follow-up since. Doctor: I understand. Let's check some blood tests to rule out any infection. Your C-reactive protein, blood counts, and sedimentation rate are all within reference values, so there's no sign of infection. Patient: That's a relief. So what should we do about the broken cable? Doctor: We will need to extract the broken part of the cable. This can be done with a small incision from the medial side and the remaining part with a larger lateral incision under general anesthesia. Patient: Alright, I understand. What about the cable's position near the nerves and muscles? Doctor: The tip of the broken cable is buried in the medial adductor muscles, which lie posterior to the femoral neurovascular bundle and anterior to the sciatic nerve. Our surgical team will be careful during the extraction process. Patient: I'm glad to hear that. How should I expect to feel after the extraction? Doctor: You should feel comfortable and pain-free after the extraction. We will schedule follow-ups to monitor your recovery and ensure everything is healing properly. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: Patient reports experiencing pain and decreased range of motion in both hips, affecting daily activities. History of bilateral total hip arthroplasty with a trochanteric osteotomy on the right hip, using a stainless steel cable system for fixation. Patient was pain-free for 4 years post-surgery but began experiencing pain and tenderness in the right inguinal area last month, with a painful prominence by palpation, not related to weight bearing. O: Physical examination of the hip showed no pathology. Recent radiographies revealed a broken trochanteric cable in the right hip with approximately 5 cm of the cable migrated medially. Blood tests including C-reactive protein, blood counts, and sedimentation rate are within normal ranges, indicating no infection. A: Primary diagnosis is mechanical failure of hip arthroplasty hardware (broken trochanteric cable) without infection. Differential diagnosis could include infection or recurrent hip dysplasia, both ruled out by clinical and laboratory findings. P: Plan to surgically extract the broken part of the cable with a small medial incision and a larger lateral incision under general anesthesia. Care will be taken to avoid damage to nearby nerves and muscles. Post-operative follow-ups will be scheduled to monitor recovery and ensure proper healing.

"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello there, I understand you had a subtotal esophagectomy and reconstruction using a gastric tube about 11 years ago. How can I help you today? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having some abdominal pain recently. I haven't had any signs of disease recurrence in the past 5 years, though. Doctor: I see. Let's start by doing an ultrasonography to check for any abnormalities. Patient: Sure, sounds good. *After ultrasonography* Doctor: The ultrasonography revealed dilatation of the biliary tree, so I am going to refer you to our hospital for further examination. Patient: Okay, what's next? *At the hospital* Doctor: We've conducted a laboratory test, and it showed no hepatorenal or hematological abnormalities. However, we did find that your carbohydrate antigen 19-9 has increased slightly to 54.1 U/ml, while carcinoembryonic antigen, DUPAN-2, and Span-1 were within normal range. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: We need to perform a contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) scan to get a better understanding of the situation. *After CT scan* Doctor: The CT scan showed a 20 mm low-density area in the pancreatic head at the convergence of the dilated common bile duct and the main pancreatic duct. The tumor doesn't seem to reach the surface of the pancreas, and there is no invasion of the GDA. We've confirmed the patency of the RGEA, RGEV, RGA, and RGV. Also, there is no distant metastasis. Patient: That's a relief. What's the next step? Doctor: We will perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to get a clearer picture of the tumor. *After MRI* Doctor: The MRI showed a tumor with irregularly low-intensity on T2 weighted image, mild low-intensity on T1 weighted image, and gradual enhancement with contrast medium from the margin. Patient: What does this all mean? Doctor: We also did a combination of positron emission tomography with fluoro-2-deoxyglucose and CT, which confirmed the tumor as a thin uptake area with a maximum standard uptake value of 2.6. Based on these findings, you have been diagnosed with resectable pancreatic head cancer. Patient: Oh no, what do we do now? Doctor: We need to address a separate issue first. Your electrocardiogram revealed a complete left bundle branch block, and your coronary angiogram showed a 99% stenosis of a coronary artery branch. We will need to place a coronary artery stent before proceeding with cancer treatment. *After stent placement* Doctor: Obstructive jaundice occurred a few days following the stenting, so we placed an endoscopic biliary stent. We will perform the operation for the pancreatic cancer a month after biliary drainage. *After the operation* Doctor: The laparotomy by upper midline incision went well. We conducted a peritoneal exploration and found no peritoneal metastases, although we did feel a hard mass. Patient: What's the plan moving forward? Doctor: We will continue to monitor your progress and provide any necessary follow-up care. We will work together to ensure the best possible outcome for you. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, who underwent a subtotal esophagectomy and reconstruction using a gastric tube 11 years ago, presents with recent abdominal pain. He reports no signs of disease recurrence in the past 5 years. O: Ultrasonography revealed dilatation of the biliary tree. Laboratory tests showed normal hepatorenal and hematological profiles, but elevated carbohydrate antigen 19-9 at 54.1 U/ml (normal <37 U/ml). CT scan identified a 20 mm low-density area in the pancreatic head without distant metastasis or invasion of major arteries. MRI findings indicated a tumor with irregularly low-intensity on T2, mild low-intensity on T1, and gradual contrast enhancement. PET-CT confirmed the tumor with a maximum SUV of 2.6, suggesting resectable pancreatic head cancer. An ECG showed a complete left bundle branch block, and coronary angiogram revealed 99% stenosis of a coronary artery branch, necessitating stent placement. Post-stent placement, obstructive jaundice occurred, managed with an endoscopic biliary stent. Peritoneal exploration during laparotomy found no metastases but confirmed a hard mass. A: The primary diagnosis is resectable pancreatic head cancer. The patient also has significant coronary artery disease, which required immediate intervention with stent placement. The findings suggest no current distant metastasis or major vascular invasion, which is favorable for prognosis. P: The patient underwent successful coronary stent placement followed by biliary stenting due to obstructive jaundice. The plan includes performing pancreatic cancer surgery one month post-biliary drainage. Postoperative management will involve regular monitoring and follow-up care to assess recovery and detect any recurrence or complications. Further oncological treatment, including chemotherapy, may be considered based on postoperative histopathological findings. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I see you've been referred to our neuro-ophthalmology clinic for progressive visual disturbances over the past three months. Can you tell me more about these disturbances? Patient: Yeah, I've been experiencing a loss of the left visual field in both of my eyes. I don't see any floaters or flashes of light though. Doctor: I understand. It seems like you were diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma stage IV a year ago, with metastases to the breast, pancreas, lungs, and ovaries. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's right. I first presented with right breast lumps, which were then biopsied. Doctor: It looks like you completed six cycles of R-CHOP, which includes rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, along with intrathecal methotrexate, dexamethasone, and cytosine arabinoside. How did you feel during that treatment? Patient: It was tough, but I managed through it. Doctor: I also see that you developed right upper limb neuropathic pain and were diagnosed with peripheral neurolymphomatosis of the right brachial plexus four months later. Were you able to undergo the PET/CT scan with fluoro-D-glucose? Patient: Yes, I did. They told me there was no central or peripheral nervous system involvement. Doctor: That's good to know. You were started on methotrexate, but it seems you defaulted after the eighth cycle. Can you tell me why? Patient: I had some personal issues and couldn't continue the treatment. Doctor: I see. The visual disturbances you mentioned earlier, did they worsen about a month prior to this presentation? Patient: Yes, they did. I also started experiencing short-term memory loss and emotional lability around that time. Doctor: Were there any other symptoms like fits, body weakness, sensory deficits, or symptoms of high intracranial pressure such as headache, nausea, or vomiting? Patient: No, I didn't have any of those symptoms. Doctor: How about diplopia, dyschromatopsia, or metamorphopsia? And did you have any recent trauma to your eyes or head? Patient: No, I didn't experience any of those symptoms, and I've had no recent trauma. Doctor: Thank you for the information. Based on your examination, your best-corrected visual acuity is 6/9 in both eyes. Confrontation visual field testing showed left homonymous hemianopia, and there was no afferent pupillary defect. Both anterior and posterior segments were unremarkable. We confirmed a dense left homonymous hemianopia through Humphrey automated visual field testing. Patient: What does that mean, exactly? Doctor: It means that you have a significant loss of vision in the left side of your visual field in both eyes. We will need to further investigate the cause of this and determine the appropriate treatment plan. It's important to monitor your symptoms closely and let us know if there are any changes. Patient: Okay, thank you for your help, doctor. [/INST] S: The patient, a 34-year-old female with a history of stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with metastases to the breast, pancreas, lungs, and ovaries, reports progressive loss of the left visual field in both eyes over the past three months. She denies the presence of floaters, flashes of light, diplopia, dyschromatopsia, metamorphopsia, and any recent trauma. She also mentions worsening visual disturbances and the onset of short-term memory loss and emotional lability about a month ago. The patient completed six cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy and intrathecal therapy but defaulted after the eighth cycle of methotrexate due to personal issues. O: Examination reveals best-corrected visual acuity of 6/9 in both eyes. Confrontation visual field testing indicates left homonymous hemianopia, confirmed by Humphrey automated visual field testing. There is no afferent pupillary defect, and both anterior and posterior segments of the eyes are unremarkable. The patient's history includes a diagnosis of peripheral neurolymphomatosis of the right brachial plexus, treated with chemotherapy. Recent PET/CT scan showed no central or peripheral nervous system involvement. A: The primary diagnosis is left homonymous hemianopia, likely secondary to central nervous system involvement by lymphoma or post-treatment effects, despite recent imaging not showing direct involvement. Differential diagnoses could include stroke or other neurological conditions.
